Feb 21 20:01:29 <uuuuu>	Lets say I wanted unprivileged users to bind to ports below port 1024. I also want to control them binding to important services (before they start or after dos) running sub 1024 (or any port really). Authbind doesn't look like it has been updated since 2017. I see its possible to have semanage port. Questions: I imagine to make all port unprivileged ports I would need to set sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start to a low value 
Feb 21 20:01:29 <uuuuu>	before doing this via selinux. Does selinux prevent applications from listening on ports not defined and allowed by default? I ask this because I run php -S localhost:9999 and I am able to see content served, but when I look in semanage port -l output I see jboss_management_port_t allows 9999. With sudo sesearch --allow | grep -i jboss I was able to see application rule associated with port label were httpd_t tomcat_domain and some 
Feb 21 20:01:29 <uuuuu>	others. Why is php able to listen on port 9999? How can I see rules associated with php?
Feb 21 20:03:32 <uuuuu>	I see allow httpd_php_t httpd_t:fd use;
Feb 21 20:03:33 <uuuuu>	allow httpd_php_t httpd_t:fifo_file { append getattr ioctl lock read write };
Feb 21 20:03:33 <uuuuu>	allow httpd_php_t httpd_t:process sigchld; when grepping output of allow are these rules why?
Feb 21 20:18:11 <grift>	uuuuu: use the setools analysis suite for that
Feb 21 20:19:03 <grift>	uuuuu: selinux does not care about uid/gid so you can give any user access to any port from that perspective
Feb 21 20:19:54 <grift>	but for a unprivileged user to bind sockets to ports below 1024, that use must have access to CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability
Feb 21 20:20:17 <uuuuu>	grift: there is no way to do it via command line?  Why can't I use sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start
Feb 21 20:21:06 <grift>	maybe you can i wasnt aware of that sysctl
Feb 21 20:22:17 <uuuuu>	grift: can you elaborate on what you mean with "selinux does not care about uid/gid so you can give any user access to any port from that perspective" What perspective are you referring to? 
Feb 21 20:22:19 <grift>	but you can probably for example associate ambient capabilities with the user@UID.service but if that works then I suppose the whole session will have that access
Feb 21 20:22:32 <grift>	would be better than that sysctl though if that works
Feb 21 20:22:49 <uuuuu>	why would it be better than sysctl
Feb 21 20:23:13 <uuuuu>	because it would just give that user the privileges/capability?
Feb 21 20:23:52 <grift>	because the sysctl is "global" where using the user-UID.service is per user
Feb 21 20:24:42 <grift>	UID/GID are "DAC" attributes and SELinux does not know about that (generally speaking(
Feb 21 20:25:01 <grift>	so SELinux generally is not aware of UID/GID
Feb 21 20:25:19 <grift>	so it does not care whether your uid is 0 or 1000
Feb 21 20:25:39 <grift>	selinux enforces types, not uid/gid
Feb 21 20:26:13 <uuuuu>	grift: so for this case it would only be able process allow rules associated with programs that run?
Feb 21 20:26:33 <grift>	depends
Feb 21 20:26:51 <grift>	but generally you can allow access with allow rules yes
Feb 21 20:27:50 <grift>	use sesearch (part of setools) to determine what ports processes associated with a given type can access in what way
Feb 21 20:27:58 <grift>	then go from there
Feb 21 20:28:11 <grift>	if there are no allow rules for what you need then add some
Feb 21 20:29:32 <grift>	but it would make sense that the policy does for example not allow a type that is supposed to be associated with an unprivilged user login shell access to a type that is supposed to be associated with a port below 1024
Feb 21 20:29:59 <grift>	because without fiddling with capabilities or sysctls that wouldnt work anyway
Feb 21 20:30:12 <grift>	so in that case just add a rule, easy enough
Feb 21 20:30:43 <grift>	you see ambient capabilities are fairly new, theyre newer than selinux for sure
Feb 21 20:31:00 <uuuuu>	jboss_management_port_t is a label and httpd_t is a type right?
Feb 21 20:31:18 <grift>	both are types 
Feb 21 20:31:32 <grift>	_t suffix indicates its a type
Feb 21 20:32:46 <grift>	try something like:
Feb 21 20:33:13 <uuuuu>	so I know I can use sesearch to search type but how can I see process associated 
Feb 21 20:33:18 <uuuuu>	with that type
Feb 21 20:33:25 <uuuuu>	*process -> program
Feb 21 20:33:27 <grift>	systemctl set-property AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE user-1000.slice
Feb 21 20:34:00 <grift>	thats a bit harder
Feb 21 20:34:49 <grift>	you have to use sesearch to determine where and how those types can be entered and then see which processes have permissions to enter those types
Feb 21 20:35:27 <grift>	in practice though it shouldnt be hard
Feb 21 20:35:42 <grift>	you just produce the issue and selinux will log when it blocks
Feb 21 20:35:55 <grift>	then you interpret the log message and add the rule
Feb 21 20:36:12 <uuuuu>	"you have to use sesearch to determine where and how those types can be entered and then see which processes have permissions to enter those types" how do I do this

Feb 21 20:38:01 *	Topic for #selinux set by perfinion!perfinion@gentoo/developer/perfinion (Sun May 30 22:23:40 2021)
Feb 21 20:38:27 <grift>	you would: sesearch -A -t httpd_t -c file -p entrypoint
Feb 21 20:38:54 <grift>	that will tell you that httpd_t can be entered via files associated with httpd_exec_t
Feb 21 20:39:41 <grift>	then you can use setools to ask selinux who can execute files with that httpd_exec_t type because type transition happen on execve
Feb 21 20:40:28 <grift>	and then you can use that infomation to ask selinux which of those types that can execute files associated  with httpd_exec_t are allowed to transition to type httpd-t
Feb 21 20:41:35 <grift>	and then you know that for example httpd_t can be entered through httpd_exec_t which would be /usr/bin/httpd or something, by specified processes associated with specified types
Feb 21 20:41:54 <grift>	but again in practice it doesnt have to be this complicated
Feb 21 20:42:23 <grift>	you just try something, selinux blocks, you look at what selinux logs and determine what rule you need to add to make it happen
Feb 21 20:43:23 <grift>	but aside, setools allows you to read selinux' mind
Feb 21 20:43:48 <uuuuu>	grift: when I do sudo sesearch -A -t httpd_php_t -c file -p entrypoint or sudo sesearch -A -t httpd_t -c file -p entrypoint I get no output
Feb 21 20:44:58 <grift>	oops -t is -s
Feb 21 20:45:25 <grift>	sesearch -A -s httpd_t -c file -p entrypoint
Feb 21 20:45:49 <grift>	but the -t variant is also interesting:
Feb 21 20:46:03 <grift>	sesearch -A -t httpd_exec_t -c file -p entrypoint
Feb 21 20:51:15 <uuuuu>	so that -t variaant does the "and then you can use that infomation to ask selinux which of those types that can execute files associated  with httpd_exec_t are allowed to transition to type httpd-t" part?
Feb 21 20:51:44 <grift>	the -s one
Feb 21 20:52:06 <grift>	but the output of the -t and -s one are probably mostly the same
Feb 21 20:52:30 <grift>	although it does not have to be
Feb 21 20:53:09 <grift>	look if you know what you want to allow then you probably don't have to go into analysis this deep
Feb 21 20:53:19 <grift>	you just produce the event and then add the rule
Feb 21 20:53:28 <uuuuu>	I don't know yet
Feb 21 20:53:35 <uuuuu>	I just want to know this indepth
Feb 21 20:53:40 <grift>	ok
Feb 21 20:53:52 <grift>	well setools and matchpathcon
Feb 21 20:54:07 <grift>	they will tell you everything selinux knows
Feb 21 20:54:29 <grift>	you just have to know how to ask the right questions
Feb 21 20:54:54 <grift>	and that gets into the topic of labeling
Feb 21 20:55:02 <grift>	one of selinux core topics
Feb 21 20:55:19 <grift>	how do labels get associated with all this stuff
Feb 21 20:55:20 <uuuuu>	how would you find that httpd_exec_t is associated with  /usr/bin/httpd (I'm looking for the path to be in the output of command run)
Feb 21 20:55:30 <grift>	like process files, filesystems ,network objects etc etc
Feb 21 20:55:48 <grift>	one ugly way would be:
Feb 21 20:56:00 <grift>	. /etc/selinux/config
Feb 21 20:56:42 <grift>	grep httpd_exec_t /etc/selinux/${SELINUXTYPE}/contexts/files/file_contexts
Feb 21 20:57:12 <grift>	or semanage fcontext -l | grep httpd_exec_t
Feb 21 20:58:57 <grift>	point is that to be able to transition from one type to another there are certain rule needed
Feb 21 20:59:14 <grift>	it depends on the type of transition
Feb 21 20:59:34 <grift>	there are three kinds manual, automatic and dymanic
Feb 21 21:00:37 <grift>	with a manual transition to need access to "process setexec" and then be allow the "transition" permission on the type you want to transition to
Feb 21 21:01:03 <grift>	and you also need to be able the execute the entryfile
Feb 21 21:01:28 <grift>	and that type of file needs to be allowed entrypoint to the target process type
Feb 21 21:01:44 <grift>	allow foo foo:process setexec
Feb 21 21:01:59 <grift>	allow foo bar:process transition
Feb 21 21:02:31 <grift>	allow foo bar_exec:file { execute read ... }
Feb 21 21:02:49 <grift>	allow bar bar_exec:file entrypoint
Feb 21 21:03:12 <grift>	that example not quite complete but those are some of the core permissions
Feb 21 21:03:47 <grift>	and then for an automatic transition you dont need the setexec but you do need a type_transition statement to tell selinux what to do
Feb 21 21:04:12 <grift>	type_transition foo bar_exec:process bar;
Feb 21 21:05:14 <grift>	so quite a bit of stuff involved
Feb 21 21:06:54 <grift>	the upside  is that you have a log of flexibility
Feb 21 21:06:59 <grift>	lot
Feb 21 21:07:47 <uuuuu>	yeah
Feb 21 21:07:50 <uuuuu>	thanks
Feb 21 21:15:00 <uuuuu>	grift: so how can I find what types are using the  jboss_management_port_t  type?
Feb 21 21:15:23 <uuuuu>	because I do sudo sesearch -A -s jboss_management_port_t and there is no output
Feb 21 21:15:37 <grift>	seinfo --portcon | grep jboss
Feb 21 21:16:10 <grift>	its a type associated with a network port address/protocol
Feb 21 21:16:27 <grift>	you see everything has a type not just processes
Feb 21 21:16:52 <grift>	file, filesystems, device nodes, network objects you name it everything needs to have a label
Feb 21 21:17:34 <grift>	you can group types to give them meaning
Feb 21 21:17:37 <grift>	like tagging
Feb 21 21:17:52 <grift>	but the tags used depends on the policy obviously
Feb 21 21:18:22 <grift>	but you can query tags (typeattributes) associated with types and vice versa
Feb 21 21:18:38 <grift>	example: seinfo -xthttp_port_t
Feb 21 21:18:51 <grift>	or seinfo -xaport_type
Feb 21 21:19:39 <grift>	once you know how to ask all these questions you can start a meaningful conversation with selinux
Feb 21 21:19:53 <grift>	see the seinfo --help and sesearch --help
Feb 21 21:20:02 <grift>	youll notice theres a lot of stuff to quert
Feb 21 21:20:05 <grift>	query
Feb 21 21:21:45 <grift>	if you want to enforce a sophisticated access control then you need a sophisticated way to express your requirements
Feb 21 21:28:42 <uuuuu>	so I see from sudo  semanage fcontext -l | grep httpd_exec_t that /usr/sbin/php-fpm is one of the executables being used and I know that php -S is spawning that process. I set localhost:9999 and I am able to access it with no issue. Since php-fpm is httpd_exec_t I am trying to find what allows it to listen on port 9999 when semanage ports -l | grep jboss (as well as seinfo --portcon | grep jboss) shows jboss_management_port_t is the type 
Feb 21 21:28:42 <uuuuu>	using it?
Feb 21 21:28:49 <uuuuu>	grift
Feb 21 21:30:22 <grift>	you have to consider that just because /usr/sbin/php-fpm is type httpd_exec_t and httpd_exec_T is an entrypoint to httpd_t does not automatically mean that everything that executes that file transitions to httpd_t per se
Feb 21 21:30:29 <grift>	for example:
Feb 21 21:30:47 <grift>	if you operate from a shell with type unconfined_t (id -Z)
Feb 21 21:31:22 <grift>	then when you run /usr/sbin/php-fpm , the process will still run with type unconfined_t and it will not transition from unconfined_t to httpd_t
Feb 21 21:31:33 <grift>	and unconfined_t has full unconfined network access
Feb 21 21:31:56 <grift>	and thus in that case php-fpm would be able to bind sockets to any port anyway
Feb 21 21:32:10 <grift>	whether a transition happens or not needs to be specified
Feb 21 21:33:09 <grift>	and even then there could be conditionals telling selinux that httpd_t may in certain circumstances do things it might noe be allowed in other circumstances
Feb 21 21:33:17 <grift>	with boolean conditionals
Feb 21 21:33:27 <grift>	seinfo --boolean
Feb 21 21:33:37 <grift>	sesearch -A -b ...
Feb 21 21:34:57 <grift>	again lots of flexibility and that requires that you are specific when you express your policy
Feb 21 21:35:18 <uuuuu>	seinfo --boolean yields unrecognized argument
Feb 21 21:35:44 <grift>	--bool
Feb 21 21:36:08 <grift>	seinfo -x -bool
Feb 21 21:37:39 <grift>	or -xb i guess
Feb 21 21:37:43 <grift>	seinfo -xb
Feb 21 21:37:59 <grift>	but the beef is in sesearch -A -b ...
Feb 21 21:38:18 <grift>	then you see the rules associated with a given boolean identifier
Feb 21 21:38:47 <grift>	there might be a boolean that when set to true allow broad network access
Feb 21 21:38:49 <grift>	i dont know
Feb 21 21:38:59 <grift>	policy is just configuration
Feb 21 21:39:10 <grift>	thats why its so important to use seinfo and sesearch
Feb 21 21:39:37 <grift>	so that you can get answers to question no matter what policy configuration youre dealing with
Feb 21 21:40:10 <uuuuu>	thanks
Feb 21 21:44:20 <grift>	but:
Feb 21 21:44:36 <grift>	seinfo --portcon 9999
Feb 21 21:44:43 <grift>	that would return a type
Feb 21 21:45:03 <grift>	so lets for the sake of argument say it returns unreserved_port_t
Feb 21 21:45:07 <grift>	then you can :
Feb 21 21:45:30 <grift>	sesearch -A -t unreserved_port_t -c tcp_socket -p name_bind
Feb 21 21:45:55 <grift>	that will then return all the rules that allow name_bind access to tcp/9999
Feb 21 21:52:13 <grift>	but the main thing to understand is that selinux doesnt know about uid/gid permissions bits etc (DAC)
Feb 21 21:52:57 <grift>	a policy writer can gives types meaning but that is just a meaning given by the policy writer
Feb 21 21:53:15 <grift>	selinux doesnt care, its all just types
Feb 21 21:54:19 <uuuuu>	grift: when I do sesearch -A -t jboss_management_port_t -c tcp_socket -p name_bind | grep -i http I see allow httpd_t jboss_management_port_t:tcp_socket name_bind; so if I was using a confined user, this rule would allow httpd_t type to use httpd_exec_t, but this is different from httpd_php_t so a confined user wouldn't allow php to run right?
Feb 21 21:55:07 <grift>	youd have to more specific "confined user" does not mean anything
Feb 21 21:55:18 <grift>	you have to think in terms of contexts (types)
Feb 21 21:56:11 <uuuuu>	I mean as confined user vs unconfined as defined like in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/using_selinux/managing-confined-and-unconfined-users_using-selinux
Feb 21 21:56:17 <grift>	would the type associated with the confined user be allowd to run httpd_exec_t associated files with a type transition to httpd_t in the first place?
Feb 21 21:56:23 <grift>	that depends on the policy
Feb 21 21:56:49 <grift>	user might not even be allowed to access that file or it might be allowed to execute it without a transition but not with a transition
Feb 21 21:56:58 <grift>	those are details that are important
Feb 21 21:57:54 <grift>	its all about types
Feb 21 21:58:09 <grift>	"confined user" is meaning less
Feb 21 21:58:19 <grift>	selinux does not know what that is
Feb 21 22:09:58 <uuuuu>	so how can I view raw default policy semanage export documentation looks like it just gives modification. From https://serverfault.com/questions/746179/view-custom-selinux-policies I see that it is located https://github.com/fedora-selinux/selinux-policy/tree/rawhide what directory should I look in?
Feb 21 22:11:14 <grift>	that policy at github is not "raw" policy but its "source" policy
Feb 21 22:11:41 <grift>	if you want to see what source is installed then youd do like with any package source
Feb 21 22:12:02 <grift>	you enable the source repository and download the src package
Feb 21 22:12:12 <grift>	that will install the exact src
Feb 21 22:12:28 <grift>	if you want to see the raw policy (but think twice)
Feb 21 22:12:38 <uuuuu>	but would it be all one file or would it be spread across different directories like in the github
Feb 21 22:13:00 <grift>	for module in $(semodule -l) ; do semodule --cil -E $module; done
Feb 21 22:13:04 <grift>	ls *.cil
Feb 21 22:13:57 <grift>	but that is pretty much the same as what you see with seinfo/sesearch etc
Feb 21 22:14:09 <grift>	different files
Feb 21 22:14:15 <grift>	its a "modular" policy
Feb 21 22:14:32 <grift>	ie you can disable/remove parts of it
Feb 21 22:16:51 <uuuuu>	interesting how --cil is not in man page
Feb 21 22:17:06 <uuuuu>	nevermind
Feb 21 22:18:30 <grift>	going to sleep, bye
Feb 21 22:18:38 <uuuuu>	thanks

Feb 22 20:19:25 <orionp>	I'm working on policy for fail2ban.  Currently we use logging_read_all_logs(fail2ban_t), but we need an equivalent for watch permissions.   I see logging_watch_all_log_dirs_path, but nothing that gives watch to the actual files.
Feb 22 20:19:49 <orionp>	I'm also not sure what things have the "logfile" attribute - not familiar with attributes yet.

Feb 22 20:24:10 <bleve>	orionp: sounds like it would be better idea to enhance that interface
Feb 22 20:24:26 <bleve>	orionp: or more correct.
Feb 22 20:26:09 <orionp>	bleve: Okay, I'll make an issue here then I guess https://github.com/fedora-selinux/selinux-policy/
Feb 22 20:26:40 <bleve>	likely nobody even thaught that would be needed to actually follow the logs.
Feb 22 20:27:19 <orionp>	I guess I'm not sure it's absolutely needed - but it is requested
Feb 22 20:27:36 <bleve>	does it work without?
Feb 22 20:27:57 <bleve>	it could also just need dontaudit.
Feb 22 20:29:38 <orionp>	Well - it still produces: fail2ban.filterpyinotify[39079]: ERROR   add_watch: cannot watch /var/log/httpd/ssl_access_log WD=-1, Errno=Permission denied (EACCES)
Feb 22 20:30:17 <orionp>	Again, I don't know much about "watch" - there are other interfaces that do grant watch permissions for files, so it seems like a thing
Feb 22 20:30:43 <bleve>	indeed- looks like it is really needed.

Feb 22 20:37:05 <orionp>	I've filed https://github.com/fedora-selinux/selinux-policy/issues/2048   In any case, I'm going to need to implement this on EL8/9 now - so I'll need my interim solution.
Feb 22 20:43:12 <concord_>	if youre writing a local policy module just for the local system you dont *need* to use an interface (but its nice if it exists)
Feb 22 20:43:44 <concord_>	you can bring in the required types in a require/gen_require block, then write raw rules to allow the access you need
Feb 22 20:44:34 <concord_>	that does seem like a bug in fedora-selinux though

Feb 22 20:54:48 <bleve>	orionp: just like you do for zabbix.
Feb 22 20:54:57 <bleve>	btw. I'd have some improvements for zabbix one :D

Feb 23 14:52:29 <grift>	unclear to me to
Feb 23 14:52:47 <grift>	if its possible then i couldnt get it to work
Feb 23 14:53:02 <grift>	i recall trying it for /proc/self/mounts
Feb 23 14:55:27 <grift>	i guess the magic word is "could"
Feb 23 14:57:40 <grift>	i guess maybe genfscon somehow
Feb 23 14:58:05 <grift>	not sure how you would express that
Feb 23 15:13:31 <grift>	i think there was a patch recently for simple globbing in genfscon but i might be wrong
Feb 23 17:17:31 <bauen1>	guess I'd have to look at the kernel code
Feb 23 17:17:45 <bauen1>	could be useful for a few things (/proc/self/mounts and /proc/self/mem e.g.)
Feb 23 17:58:35 <grift>	bigon: I would ping and cc james carter on mailinglist but that is just me
Feb 23 20:33:52 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to pcmoore
Feb 23 20:46:38 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to pebenito
Feb 23 21:04:43 <grift>	i would bet this is libselinux: https://github.com/SELinuxProject/refpolicy/commit/b8ad74030f6b90d701895906e30d955ded5465a9
Feb 23 21:05:11 <grift>	if libselinux cannot do its think then it reads /proc/filesystems
Feb 23 21:05:23 <grift>	the avc denial has permissive=0
Feb 23 21:05:49 <grift>	so i suspect instead it needs seutils_libselinux_linked()
Feb 23 21:06:02 <grift>	mkdir obviously links with libselinux
Feb 23 21:09:58 <grift>	on the one hand mkdir probably does not need selinux awareness in this scenario but on the other hand its kind of weird to block libselinux on a selinux system
