janv. 18 08:04:42 <S_SubZero>	One Windows thing I never got.. I just did a new PC build so I'm more attuned to the new sounds it makes.. It idles at like 35c. I did some old 4K gaming (AMD 7700/7800XT), barely sweats. I run Windows Update or Microsoft Store: CPU immediately goes into the 60s until it's done lol.
janv. 18 08:06:13 <S_SubZero>	the irony is Win11's Windows Update has that "Windows Update is committed to helping reduce carbon emissions" when it runs the system at full bore when it's working
janv. 18 08:12:43 <TheFatherMind->	I run SFC and fix any violated files with it.  I install the 23H2 upgrade.. I run SFC again.. again and it finds violations.
janv. 18 08:12:56 <TheFatherMind->	So the upgrade is corrupting files.

janv. 18 09:17:28 <nshire>	is there a setting or registry key to make it just copy your screen to clipboard
janv. 18 09:18:02 <nshire>	I really don't understand why ms thought they needed to reinvent the wheel with everything in win11
janv. 18 09:18:16 <CptLuxx>	because its better
janv. 18 09:18:18 <CptLuxx>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
janv. 18 09:18:34 <CptLuxx>	and most users can actually use the snipping tool
janv. 18 09:19:16 <nshire>	snipping tool is nice when you have some time to frame it
janv. 18 09:19:32 <nshire>	sometimes you need to take an instantaneous screenshot for something quick

janv. 18 10:05:52 <lusciouslover>	is there anyway to make keyboard switching more like it is on ios and chromeos?
janv. 18 10:06:23 <lusciouslover>	where it will just switch between your two last used keyboards normally, but your other ones if you press super+space quickly?
janv. 18 10:07:05 <lusciouslover>	i need to use russian and english keyboards the most, but i have other keyboards installed for when i need to type other characters that i use less frequently, that make switching from russian to english more annoying than it should be
janv. 18 10:14:28 <S_SubZero>	Is this relevant? https://superuser.com/questions/1092696/how-to-switch-between-just-2-keyboard-languages-on-windows-10
janv. 18 10:17:41 <lusciouslover>	yes thats exactly perfect
janv. 18 10:17:47 <lusciouslover>	i had no idea that was so simple
janv. 18 10:17:49 <lusciouslover>	thank you
janv. 18 10:47:30 <UncleKiwi>	Hello, I have 21H2 - does it not just auto upgrade with a windows update ?
janv. 18 10:50:05 <CptLuxx>	it should unless there is a block.. just run the update manual https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
janv. 18 10:50:29 <UncleKiwi>	is it different ?
janv. 18 10:50:46 <UncleKiwi>	ie better etc ?

janv. 18 10:56:37 <UncleKiwi>	yep
janv. 18 10:56:50 <CptLuxx>	you should have a key like Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\TargetVersionUpgradeExperienceIndicators\NI23H2

Feb 20 17:39:06 <Marz>	Windows has this option to use a password less account which is great but then it doesn’t support RDP.
Feb 20 17:39:34 <Marz>	RDP probably hasn’t been updated in a decade
Feb 20 17:47:05 <naph-W>	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/whats-new-client-windows
Feb 20 18:01:00 <A-KO>	RDP actually does get updated, including the inbuilt RDP app, which supports webauthn redirection (Windows Hello/Passkeys/FIDO2)
Feb 20 18:01:31 <A-KO>	Windows 11 (I think Windows 10's latest feature update can also?) + remote Windows Server 2022 RDP Session = can pass passkeys through the RDP session
Feb 20 18:01:57 <A-KO>	As far as signing in to the remote session with a microsoft account, that's a good question....
Feb 20 18:06:34 <A-KO>	I know that on the on-prem world in enterprise land you can link a certificate for windows hello and use hello-backed certificate for RDP into servers ; but I don't think that's enough....
Feb 20 18:33:27 <signalblue>	<Marz> RDP probably hasn’t been updated in a decade
Feb 20 18:33:29 <signalblue>	False.
Feb 20 18:37:10 <Marz>	Well it has been updated to work with a password less account and that was introduced years ago.
Feb 20 18:37:16 <Marz>	Has not*
Feb 20 18:40:19 <signalblue>	A-KO has explained it in more details
Feb 20 21:39:56 <Azrael_->	hi
Feb 20 21:41:35 <Azrael_->	i just installed win10 on a quite old machine and all drivers seem to be found. but the graphics card is a amd radeon hd 7900 and i didn't install any proprietary drivers. should i install some from amd manually or is there no difference?
Feb 20 21:41:55 <RelayChat>	you should get the latest ones from amd
Feb 20 21:42:08 <RelayChat>	windows update will give you a driver that is likely outdated
Feb 20 21:46:59 <Azrael_->	thanks

Feb 21 03:05:37 <Angels>	Hey all!
Feb 21 03:05:39 <Angels>	Is it too abnormal to run Docker under WSL2 without Docker Desktop?
Feb 21 03:06:59 <szstr>	Where did you learn about Docker?
Feb 21 03:07:39 <TheFatherMind>	Docker Desktop is horible
Feb 21 03:08:32 <Angels>	szstr, on planet Earth! You should be welcomed here!
Feb 21 03:08:40 <Angels>	TheFatherMind, why is it?
Feb 21 03:09:21 <TheFatherMind>	I just did not like it.  Was really struggling with the ports and whatnot.
Feb 21 03:09:38 <TheFatherMind>	I mostly use docker from UnRAID which has a much better interface.
Feb 21 03:09:47 <Angels>	I did not find how to change the CMD in it.
Feb 21 03:10:12 <Angels>	I used to use Docker with CLI only.
Feb 21 03:10:46 <Angels>	And hence am asking, considering Windows as some required environment for some time, would Docker struggle too much on WSL?
Feb 21 03:10:47 <szstr>	Old timers tend to mostly like dated aydeas.
Feb 21 03:12:36 <szstr>	Anything will struggl when not done the most right way
Feb 21 03:13:29 <Angels>	szstr, do you know the right way?
Feb 21 03:14:00 <szstr>	I'd watch a Docker youtube mideo on a tutorial channel
Feb 21 03:14:12 <Angels>	You misunderstood my question.
Feb 21 03:14:17 <TheFatherMind>	You might get better answers in #Docker or #Windows-WSL
Feb 21 03:14:53 <Angels>	I am asking, do you know any adequate enough benchmark between Docker running in WSL2 CLI and Docker Desktop specifically.
Feb 21 03:14:58 <Angels>	I did not find such.
Feb 21 03:15:11 <Angels>	Thank you, TheFatherMind. This is what I will do.
Feb 21 03:15:22 <Angels>	szstr, please don't assume people are stupid by default.
Feb 21 03:15:41 <szstr>	aiight
Feb 21 03:16:31 <szstr>	I need cheese
Feb 21 03:16:36 <TheFatherMind>	Angels, szstr may have been polite there.  But your response was a bit on the rude side.
Feb 21 03:16:37 <TheFatherMind>	szstr we actually have a rule against asking people to "Look it up" on google or youtube here.
Feb 21 03:17:00 <szstr>	alright/all-right
Feb 21 03:17:15 <Angels>	The most interesting part is that that Desktop has the WSL2 feature optional.
Feb 21 03:17:35 <Angels>	I will try benchmarking it manually.
Feb 21 03:18:23 <Angels>	TheFatherMind, the rude side was the point. I am not blind.
Feb 21 03:18:50 <TheFatherMind>	No need for that.  szstr was trying to be helpful.
Feb 21 03:19:01 <Angels>	Do you think I am acting rude specifically unconsciously?
Feb 21 03:19:12 <TheFatherMind>	Do you think that makes it better????
Feb 21 03:19:23 <Angels>	Better for who? For you?
Feb 21 03:19:25 <TheFatherMind>	I will not be helping you.  You are not a nice person.  Good day
Feb 21 03:19:30 <Angels>	What's your problem?
Feb 21 03:19:46 <TheFatherMind>	I love the /ignore command!  LOVE IT
Feb 21 03:19:53 <Angels>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Feb 21 04:26:02 *	emyz has been keeping a Ubuntu install in WSL1 and a separate in WSL2 the whole time WSL2 has been avalible
Feb 21 04:26:25 <emyz>	I forget why but I'm sure it was only mostly unnecessary.
Feb 21 05:34:01 <TheFatherMind>	I have not played with WSL at all.
Feb 21 05:34:06 <TheFatherMind>	IDK why.
Feb 21 05:43:03 <TheFatherMind>	By default, the Command Prompt has a limited buffer size for displaying text output, and once this buffer is filled, the output stops scrolling and older content may be overwritten as new content is added. This behavior is character-based rather than time-based.
Feb 21 05:43:43 <TheFatherMind>	If the output buffer fills it could cause it to appear like it is frozen.. to fix this you can increase the buffer size to accommodate more output.
Feb 21 05:47:12 <TheFatherMind>	naphtali: https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8?mkt_tok=NDE3LUhXWS04MjYAAAGRaPDhyl--y4VTh7e5Oe6G82BcnAeNw3QISvqAGGQ26jhr4YS8Q49Mb_S-MNEQD3xXNUanwVDp6j9pFZOcF6d78j2aQcciTjx78QTt-HkFxZYh_XA
Feb 21 05:47:14 <zyme>	yea I usually configure cmd.exe for an insanely large buffer because, why not?
Feb 21 05:47:34 <solol>	What's the buffer for?
Feb 21 05:47:54 <solol>	isn't cmd kind of unused anymore?
Feb 21 05:48:03 <zyme>	I'm too old to modify $p$g anymore though, it can stay as-is.
Feb 21 05:48:10 <zyme>	I use it..
Feb 21 05:48:25 <solol>	I thought it was swapped for something
Feb 21 05:48:32 <solol>	I use it for little things also myself.
Feb 21 05:48:35 <zyme>	running command.com -- now that's a relic.
Feb 21 05:48:40 <TheFatherMind>	stdout
Feb 21 05:48:50 <TheFatherMind>	And I am realizing I put that response in the wrong channel.
Feb 21 05:49:24 <solol>	lol
Feb 21 05:49:28 <solol>	I just noticed that too
Feb 21 05:49:30 <solol>	lolz.
Feb 21 05:49:31 <solol>	I laughed
Feb 21 05:49:49 <TheFatherMind>	Glad I could bring you some entertainment

Feb 21 11:21:50 <amcsi>	help, I'm trying to give my user read access to certificate files generated by certbot, but even though I do, I'm still not able to read the files: https://imgur.com/a/oEZiNin
Feb 21 11:24:02 <H4ndy>	not sure if you also need at least read access to the previous folders as well
Feb 21 11:24:34 <amcsi>	hmm, I'll try
Feb 21 11:28:35 <amcsi>	didn't help. also, I'm able to read the folder
Feb 21 11:29:27 <Leoneof>	ask chatbot
Feb 21 11:53:12 <amcsi>	I don't know who that is, but I would like to ask you, because you're Windows people
Feb 21 11:55:22 <Leoneof>	most of them are snoring, maybe they will answer later
Feb 21 12:00:51 <amcsi>	ok, I can wait
Feb 21 12:04:51 <Leoneof>	+1
Feb 21 12:55:26 <zyme>	amcsi: How do you know they don't have read access?
Feb 21 16:26:49 <donofrio>	How do I get past this windows 11 setup stage it just shows "Personalized Settings (not responding)" and just sits there....

Feb 21 17:05:50 <Angels>	donofrio, networking issue?
Feb 21 17:06:22 <Angels>	Is it SSD or HDD? Where is the intaller located during installation?
Feb 21 17:18:28 <amcsi>	zyme, because Notepad is telling me: You do not have permission to open this file.
Feb 21 17:22:26 <zyme>	the OS could have it locked, a couple simple things to check first,
Feb 21 17:24:20 <zyme>	use cmd to browse to the folder, make sure that dir can see the files and that they have a size, and type cacls filename
Feb 21 17:25:11 <zyme>	also run whoami just to verify that too for good measure
Feb 21 17:25:53 <amcsi>	zyme, if I open the file as an administrator, then I'm able to read it
Feb 21 17:26:00 <zyme>	and since PEM are all text on the inside anyway, try to run `type filename.pem`
Feb 21 17:26:02 <donofrio>	Angels, no networking is working fine, the VPN is connected and everything (had to do it from task manager show file location then click in it but is ran just fine)
Feb 21 17:26:34 <Angels>	Does it work now, donofrio?
Feb 21 17:27:20 <amcsi>	zyme, my regular user is able to see the files and that they have a size. But when I type cacls filename, I get "Access is denied."
Feb 21 17:27:25 <zyme>	one would normally hope, but there is a secpol.msc setting that lets you read any file nomatter the ACL or account
Feb 21 17:27:47 <zyme>	leave those on the last resort pile
Feb 21 17:28:15 <amcsi>	zyme, I am able to read the file with as an administrator though
Feb 21 17:29:08 <zyme>	that's a good sign
Feb 21 17:29:41 <zyme>	can you rename them as the admin?
Feb 21 17:29:52 <zyme>	copy them elseswhere?
Feb 21 17:36:07 <zyme>	I don't remember the default settings but I doubt it would include a new sub-directory on the Cdrive root, but there is that windows anti-randsomewear feature that likes to make files inaccessable to locations when from the internet..
Feb 21 17:41:47 <guideX>	how do you stop windows 11 from searching bing in the start menu
Feb 21 17:42:01 <RelayChat>	there is a group policy settings for that
Feb 21 17:42:09 <CptLuxx>	there is also a normal setting...
Feb 21 17:42:21 <guideX>	like for instance, sometimes I type something like network and sharing center and hit enter out of habbit, and bing pops up, despite I was loooking for the control panel, and also my default browser isnot bing
Feb 21 17:42:33 <CptLuxx>	privacy & security > search permissions
Feb 21 17:42:35 <CptLuxx>	hard to find.
Feb 21 17:43:07 <guideX>	so like I am in here, but nothing in here is like "search through bing in the start menu"
Feb 21 17:43:11 <guideX>	there's no way to turn it off
Feb 21 17:44:48 <naph-W>	You could also click on the Start button and just type
Feb 21 17:44:58 <guideX>	naph-W, yes that is what I am doing
Feb 21 17:45:10 <naph-W>	I don't get Bing results
Feb 21 17:45:10 <guideX>	and the result that pops up is a browser popup to bing
Feb 21 17:45:42 <guideX>	it says "network and sharing center" and in little text below that "see more search results"
Feb 21 17:46:05 <guideX>	it's just going directly to the (wrong) browser, and skipping everything useful
Feb 21 17:46:18 <RelayChat>	https://nerdschalk.com/how-to-remove-bing-from-start-in-windows-11-or-10/
Feb 21 17:46:21 <naph-W>	Oh yeah, I never click on those results
Feb 21 17:46:32 <guideX>	naph-W, also hitting enter causes bing to popup
Feb 21 17:46:35 <RelayChat>	yeah you cann do it via settings
Feb 21 17:46:37 <guideX>	there's nothing but bing search
Feb 21 17:46:46 <guideX>	RelayChat, checking, thaks
Feb 21 17:46:54 <naph-W>	When it says "See work and web results" why would you click on it?
Feb 21 17:47:03 <naph-W>	When you don't want web results
Feb 21 17:47:09 <guideX>	naph-W, either clicking on it, or hitting enter, causes bing to popup *shrug
Feb 21 17:47:13 <guideX>	it makes little sense to me
Feb 21 17:47:32 <naph-W>	No, I am asking why you are even clicking on it when it says it's web results
Feb 21 17:47:38 <guideX>	if I type something like control panel, or network and sharing center and it pops up with bing search results, idk something is totally jacked up
Feb 21 17:47:47 <guideX>	I am not clicking on it, I am hitting enter after typing it
Feb 21 17:47:53 <RelayChat>	it's easy to hit enter out of habit
Feb 21 17:48:02 <RelayChat>	https://4sysops.com/archives/turn-off-web-search-in-windows-11-using-group-policy/
Feb 21 17:48:14 <RelayChat>	if that setting doesnt work here's how to do it via gpo
Feb 21 17:48:21 <guideX>	hmm I'll try this, thanks
Feb 21 17:48:28 <naph-W>	Ah, I see. You are typing the entire phrase and hitting enter
Feb 21 17:48:53 <guideX>	I mean, I'm not really sure what else to do
Feb 21 17:49:37 <naph-W>	I think the real issue is search through the Start button does not expose a result for "Network and Sharing Center"
Feb 21 17:49:41 <guideX>	in win11 you can't put something like open shell, and you have no choice but to use the built in one
Feb 21 17:49:51 <naph-W>	Not the fact it's returning web results
Feb 21 17:50:06 <CptLuxx>	you can still use garbage software like that
Feb 21 17:50:10 <CptLuxx>	if it breaks its on you
Feb 21 17:50:22 <RelayChat>	i can't believe control panel still hasn't been deprecated. i mean, that promised that in 2015
Feb 21 17:50:24 <guideX>	CptLuxx, I use openshell on win10, it doesn't really work right on win11 though
Feb 21 17:50:26 <guideX>	at least not yet
Feb 21 17:51:29 <amcsi>	zyme, I can rename them and copy them with an admin
Feb 21 17:51:40 <naph-W>	I don't see Control Panel ever being removed as there is still 3rd party software that uses it
Feb 21 17:51:45 <guideX>	CptLuxx, to me, it's the built in start menu that is garbage, the one in windows since right around windows 8 has been nightmarishly garbagey
Feb 21 17:51:51 <CptLuxx>	ok
Feb 21 17:52:01 <CptLuxx>	whatever, third party startmenus are offtopic
Feb 21 17:52:03 <CptLuxx>	so we move on
Feb 21 17:52:09 <RelayChat>	that hasn't been true since 8.1
Feb 21 17:52:39 <RelayChat>	naph-W: they are clearly in the process of deprecating it but it's taken way too long
Feb 21 18:03:55 <zyme>	Windows 11 does a much better job of hiding it from you in the gui than 10 did, it's not like were talking about the old ghetto windows benchmark numbers lol.
Feb 21 18:04:24 <zyme>	similar with the old sound mixer, I thought they actually had removed it for a while
Feb 21 18:04:46 <RelayChat>	maybe windows 12 will be the release that takes care of it. it's been way too long/
Feb 21 18:05:01 <guideX>	RelayChat, idk, I'll look for it, I'm not finding it in local security policy
Feb 21 18:05:06 <guideX>	https://imgur.com/a/mPgf1zp
Feb 21 18:05:18 <guideX>	idk no matter how I type things, it is fooling me into launch bing
Feb 21 18:05:24 <zyme>	c:\Windows\System32\control.exe
Feb 21 18:05:27 <guideX>	it's like teerrible obnoxious
Feb 21 18:06:03 <RelayChat>	gpupdate /force if you applied via gpoup policy
Feb 21 18:06:11 <RelayChat>	restart explorer
Feb 21 18:09:22 <zyme>	guideX: LOL, I think it's the href url targets, it's like microsoft-edge:// instead of http:// or https://
Feb 21 18:11:00 <zyme>	guideX: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/sGZtcDpK/Not-A-Joke-Either.png
Feb 21 18:11:22 <guideX>	oh hm
Feb 21 18:11:30 <guideX>	that's weird, I have another browser as default, I will check
Feb 21 18:11:49 <RelayChat>	it defaults to edge and bing anyway
Feb 21 18:13:03 <zyme>	I think they've been doing that since before Win10 for the clickable error codes in event viewer too
Feb 21 18:44:53 <guideX>	is there some way to stop bing from opening at all? can it be uninstalled or disabled somehow?
Feb 21 18:45:18 <RelayChat>	that link didn't work?
Feb 21 18:45:41 <guideX>	well, maybe in group policy for the domain but not in local security policy
Feb 21 18:45:50 <RelayChat>	https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-11/how-to-disable-or-remove-bing-from-windows-11/
Feb 21 18:45:57 <RelayChat>	registry should work
Feb 21 18:46:16 <guideX>	ah ok i'll try that thx
Feb 21 18:46:26 <RelayChat>	open cmd as admin
Feb 21 18:46:55 <RelayChat>	Reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search" /v BingSearchEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
Feb 21 18:46:55 <RelayChat>	 && taskkill /f /im explorer.exe && explorer.exe
Feb 21 19:24:35 <tyson2>	What do people think of the idea of buying extended support for Win 10 after EOS next year?
Feb 21 19:24:53 <Mathisen>	poop
Feb 21 19:25:14 <gurki>	if you need it you need it. if you dont ...go figure.
Feb 21 19:25:26 <gurki>	same as for win7 esu^^
Feb 21 19:25:46 <tyson2>	my brother wants to extend support because his eyes only work with his current laptop screen, and he hasn't found a good replacement
Feb 21 19:25:55 <tyson2>	I'm advising against it
Feb 21 19:26:15 <tyson2>	I am recommending that he try a CRT instead of an LED or LCD screen
Feb 21 19:26:27 <gurki>	you could implement the tpm workaround
Feb 21 19:27:10 <tyson2>	gurki: you mean to allow win 10 to continue to receive updates?
Feb 21 19:27:14 <gurki>	ppl in here dont like it since theres no official support, just mentuoning it in case youre not aware
Feb 21 19:27:30 <tyson2>	gurki: that was my understanding as well
Feb 21 19:27:37 <gurki>	you can byoass the win11 tpm requirement, probably allowing win11 to work
Feb 21 19:27:43 <gurki>	bypass*
Feb 21 19:27:58 <tyson2>	got it, I will mention it to him after I look into it a bit

Feb 22 07:46:40 <TheFatherMind>	Karyonix I see no reason why any of us would know the answer to that question.
Feb 22 07:46:48 <Karyonix>	From GUI it set for programs but in regedit
Feb 22 07:46:58 <TheFatherMind>	Jim are you using a 3rd party Anti-Virus app or Firewall?
Feb 22 07:47:15 <Jim`>	TheFatherMind: nah
Feb 22 07:47:31 <Jim`>	TheFatherMind: looks like I can go to https://www.messenger.com
Feb 22 07:48:08 <Karyonix>	is set 02 in hex. When you switch to backgrounds and then switch back to programs the value is changed.
Feb 22 07:48:35 <Jim`>	TheFatherMind: I don't really wanna open up my full facebook anymore and have all the quacks I didn't want to see message me from high school 20 years later
Feb 22 07:49:09 <TheFatherMind>	Yeah, well I do not either but every time someone sends me a video.. and I get them all day.. It opens facebook anyhow in a browser.
Feb 22 07:49:35 <Karyonix>	TheFatherMind, By any of us , who exactly do you mean. Im asking is that this present in your system like mine does.
Feb 22 07:49:52 <Jim`>	TheFatherMind: plus the local popo be looking on there to see what you post in groups
Feb 22 07:50:05 <Jim`>	and probably state and fed
Feb 22 07:50:06 <TheFatherMind>	None of us work for Microsoft.. how would we know the answer to that???
Feb 22 07:51:00 <Karyonix>	You dont need to work for Microsoft to use Windows.
Feb 22 07:51:12 <Karyonix>	with test of course
Feb 22 07:51:38 <Karyonix>	someone would know, its not only to my machine
Feb 22 07:51:39 <TheFatherMind>	yes but you do have to work for microsoft to know why they are or are not doing a thing.
Feb 22 07:51:43 <TheFatherMind>	Are you trolling?
Feb 22 07:51:59 <TheFatherMind>	Nevermind a troll would lie about that anyhow.
Feb 22 07:52:13 <Karyonix>	No! Are you?
Feb 22 07:52:58 <Karyonix>	Why to troll, im asking real thing. See for yoursel and try if you dont believe.....
Feb 22 07:53:40 <TheFatherMind>	I am done with this stupid conversation.  If you want to know why MS has not fixed something.. go ask them.
Feb 22 07:53:55 <Karyonix>	but blame me for trolling when you dont know some X problem and bot aware of it, please..
Feb 22 07:54:41 <Karyonix>	Woulb be stupid, got problem with my pc go find Bill Gates...
Feb 22 07:58:04 <Karyonix>	thats what it goes when facebook messenger topic its more interresting than os stability
Feb 22 08:03:03 <TheFatherMind>	Jim` I would start with the basics doing a SFC and DISM to check health.  Then if that did not fix it I would test it with a "Clean Boot".  If you do not know how to set up any of those things let me know and I will help you.
Feb 22 08:03:56 <Jim`>	TheFatherMind: Eh, I guess I can just check messages in browser every once in a while lol
Feb 22 08:04:15 <Jim`>	I even thought about fully deleting facebook
Feb 22 08:04:26 <Jim`>	so yeah it aint that big of a deal if I can't fix it quickly
Feb 22 08:04:39 <TheFatherMind>	Whatever works for you.  You can also run the messenger full page.. which is the same as the app.. LITERALLY the App is just Edge.
Feb 22 09:59:05 <[twisti]>	i find the clipboard history in windows 10 not to be all it could be. are there any third party tools worth trying, maybe a powertoys addon or something you guys would recommend ? what i miss most is the option to pin a paste in the way 'pin' is used in any other software - make it stick to the top of the list
Feb 22 10:00:30 <Dex2x>	Well alright then, windows got stuck on it's loading screen, booted to *nix, saw I had to repair my ESP partition. I hope that fixes things
Feb 22 13:20:10 <carpenter>	how does one manage partition flags in Windows?
Feb 22 13:51:34 <xless1>	my buddy is looking for a good irc client, any recommendations? he is a beginner and thinks his whole system is infected by viruses because he likes to look at girly sites

Feb 22 13:57:27 <carpenter>	xless1, step one is to format his harddrive then
Feb 22 13:57:53 <carpenter>	after that he can install hexchat
Feb 22 13:59:18 <xless1>	ok, you're thinking he has some probably deeply embedded baddies software, and so start over? he does complain alot that his system does weird ****
Feb 22 13:59:35 <xless1>	also he has two virus scanners
Feb 22 14:00:17 <xless1>	he has a consumer level system, so we probably have to reload a lot of his drivers and what not
Feb 22 14:01:43 <xless1>	i opened the event viewer to look at the messages, and for some reason the app died, and the window was stuck on maximize
Feb 22 14:04:19 <xless1>	i guess i need to back up his files and documents before embarking on this quest, but also i would need to figure out what version of windows to run, isnt windows home edition 11 free?
Feb 22 14:05:24 <xless1>	he might be running windows vista, i forgot to check
Feb 22 14:07:19 <PeGaSuS>	you can use Windows without activating. but if the PC supports Windows 11, it will automatically activate it if the corresponding version is installed.  so, if you have Windows 10 Pro and you install Windows 11 Pro it'll get automatically activated
Feb 22 14:08:12 <PeGaSuS>	using Windows without activating, has its drawbacks though..
Feb 22 14:08:45 <xless1>	ok im thinking to blow away the current version and re-install from scratch, almost like a clinical level deep level reformat of the hdd
Feb 22 14:10:06 <xless1>	i would get like systemrescue cd, and reformat the thing with ext3 or something and then try and reinstall the download windows version and use their installer
Feb 22 14:10:35 <carpenter>	PeGaSuS, the only drawbacks are that you can't make cosmetic changes afaik?
Feb 22 14:11:17 <PeGaSuS>	I don't really remember now. it's been ages since I didn't use an activated version
Feb 22 14:12:59 <PeGaSuS>	you also have the annoying "Activate Windows" watermark
Feb 22 14:13:59 <PeGaSuS>	also it affects updates, I think? like, you'll only get the critical ones, iirc
Feb 22 14:15:01 <xless1>	well it said to get the license key from microsoft, it costs $139, so it might be worth it, ill see what his budget is, but then im thinking a usb drive to back up his pictures and documents beforehand. i dont think he has a lot of files (<10GB), but his passwords and browser history would be lost
Feb 22 14:15:34 <xless1>	maybe we just copy the files to a dvd, not sure
Feb 22 14:16:28 <carpenter>	microsoft basically lets people use windows for free if they want to
Feb 22 14:16:30 <xless1>	probably figure out how to save his browswer history and stored passwords
Feb 22 14:17:58 <xless1>	i would likely recommend to him to use all the standard microsoft settings with a paid version
Feb 22 14:18:17 <xless1>	that way he gets all the updates and whatnot
Feb 22 14:19:01 <xless1>	he doesnt understand cloud concepts, but i think with hexchat, he can hop on windows channel and get some guidance, learn how to do stuff and such
Feb 22 14:19:54 <xless1>	he has a certificate in quatro pro
Feb 22 14:23:15 <xless1>	i dont think he uses it or wordstar, but once upon a time he was collecting class certifications
Feb 22 14:23:35 <carpenter>	xless1, are you feeling well? You seem rather confused.
Feb 22 14:25:14 <xless1>	i picked up a lower throat infection after visiting an offsite facility, there was a history of covid and now my lower throat hurts like hell. i think i ruined from smoking weed, but have since quit the habit
Feb 22 14:25:53 <carpenter>	that's it you're a troll
Feb 22 14:28:26 <xless1>	i was trying to help my buddy out with some options to fix his windows box, not troll anyone
Feb 22 14:29:42 <xless1>	honestly i did not feel well, but since you asked, i said about my health condition, which has been somewhat of an issue
Feb 22 15:23:02 <PeGaSuS>	Chrome/Firefox have an option to export all bookmarks/passwords to a file so they can be imported later
Feb 22 15:23:22 <PeGaSuS>	I bet that Edge has the same function, since it basically uses Chrome underneath
Feb 22 15:24:09 <CptLuxx>	is this a question or statement?
Feb 22 16:15:40 <Pr070cal_>	hi guys
Feb 22 16:15:48 <Pr070cal_>	im trying to install win11
Feb 22 16:16:08 <Pr070cal_>	but i get an error cant load driver
Feb 22 16:16:18 <Pr070cal_>	missing required driver to install
Feb 22 16:16:53 <CptLuxx>	let me guess
Feb 22 16:17:01 <CptLuxx>	you used dd to make the install usb drive?
Feb 22 16:17:03 <Pr070cal_>	new mb
Feb 22 16:17:08 <Pr070cal_>	yes
Feb 22 16:17:12 <CptLuxx>	well
Feb 22 16:17:14 <CptLuxx>	check the topic.
Feb 22 16:18:05 <CptLuxx>	use woeusb or some other tool @Mathisen made a tool
Feb 22 16:19:26 <Pr070cal_>	how about baleana etcher can i use that
Feb 22 16:19:30 <CptLuxx>	no.
Feb 22 16:19:39 <CptLuxx>	thats just a fancy dd overlay...
Feb 22 16:19:46 <RelayChat>	i think they are missing an nvme driver
Feb 22 16:19:47 <Pr070cal_>	also how do i bypass checks like rufus
Feb 22 16:19:52 <CptLuxx>	the windows iso is not a hybrid iso it WONT work.
Feb 22 16:19:52 <RelayChat>	it happens on a lot of hardware
Feb 22 16:19:57 <CptLuxx>	you are wrong RelayChat
Feb 22 16:20:00 <CptLuxx>	the issue is DD
Feb 22 16:20:05 <CptLuxx>	over and over again..
Feb 22 16:20:43 <RelayChat>	well, it's even written in the channel description not use use dd lol
Feb 22 16:20:53 <RelayChat>	remember that guy with a modified iso from razer? lokl
Feb 22 16:31:10 <Pr070cal_>	how about ventoy
Feb 22 16:31:19 <Pr070cal_>	https://linovox.com/create-a-windows-11-bootable-usb-in-ubuntu/?utm_content=cmp-true
Feb 22 16:31:53 <CptLuxx>	that will work..
Feb 22 16:31:56 <CptLuxx>	or use woeusb..
Feb 22 16:32:26 <Pr070cal_>	i might try ventoy so i can have linux and win11 and win11 recovery on one disk
Feb 22 16:33:49 <CptLuxx>	win11 recovery?
Feb 22 16:33:56 <CptLuxx>	the win11 iso includes everything.
Feb 22 16:34:56 <Pr070cal_>	you can backup recovery partition as iso and put it on there too
Feb 22 16:35:56 <CptLuxx>	dont know why but ok.
Feb 22 16:36:17 <Pr070cal_>	brb
Feb 22 16:44:08 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to chat
Feb 22 16:45:35 <Pr070cal_>	https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/TJbkplPb/irccloudcapture5908689023807277994.jpg
Feb 22 16:45:51 <Pr070cal_>	Same error after using ventoy

Feb 22 16:46:32 <CptLuxx>	dell? self build?
Feb 22 16:46:44 <Pr070cal_>	Self
Feb 22 16:46:54 <CptLuxx>	mainboard?
Feb 22 16:46:59 <Pr070cal_>	Asus b650m-plus
Feb 22 16:47:05 <CptLuxx>	you dont need drivers..
Feb 22 16:47:27 <CptLuxx>	try woeusb
Feb 22 16:47:28 <Pr070cal_>	I tried putting drivers on SD nothing
Feb 22 16:47:35 <CptLuxx>	what drivers?
Feb 22 16:47:49 <Pr070cal_>	Is it TPM drivers maybe
Feb 22 16:47:52 <CptLuxx>	its not
Feb 22 16:47:53 *	chat removes channel operator status from chat
Feb 22 16:48:08 <CptLuxx>	if wants the driver for the disk controller...
Feb 22 16:48:14 <CptLuxx>	OR its still the DD issue
Feb 22 16:48:14 <Pr070cal_>	The ones on Asus site audio VGA etc
Feb 22 16:48:23 <CptLuxx>	AMD RAID Driver V9.3.2.255 For Windows 10 64-bit, Windows 11 64-bit. (WHQL)
Feb 22 16:48:25 <CptLuxx>	try these.
Feb 22 16:48:34 <CptLuxx>	you need to extract them
Feb 22 16:48:38 <Pr070cal_>	I can't get woeusb working
Feb 22 16:48:41 <CptLuxx>	the installer only accepts ini files
Feb 22 16:48:53 <Pr070cal_>	Ok
Feb 22 16:48:53 <CptLuxx>	then try that [16:23:17] <CptLuxx> https://itsfoss.community/t/how-to-create-a-persitent-bootable-windows-10-usb-in-linux/9586/40?page=2
Feb 22 16:48:54 <CptLuxx>	....
Feb 22 16:49:08 <CptLuxx>	but i got almost the same mainboard and you do NOT need any drivers to install windows
Feb 22 16:49:20 <CptLuxx>	so im 99% sure you are still having the dd issue
Feb 22 16:49:49 <CptLuxx>	and you only need "AMD RAID Driver V9.3.2.255 For Windows 10 64-bit, Windows 11 64-bit. (WHQL)" this driver if you use the amd raid function
Feb 22 16:50:02 <Pr070cal_>	Yeah I'm sure I installed win11 no problems but used rufus
Feb 22 17:05:01 <Pr070cal_>	cant find drivers
Feb 22 17:05:06 <Pr070cal_>	tried all of them
Feb 22 17:05:14 <Pr070cal_>	and found their infs
Feb 22 17:05:33 <RelayChat>	what is your mobo model?
Feb 22 17:05:51 <RelayChat>	i don't have chat scrollback
Feb 22 17:10:19 <CptLuxx>	mate its not a driver issue
Feb 22 17:10:22 <CptLuxx>	for the love of god
Feb 22 17:10:31 <CptLuxx>	use woeusb or the other methode https://itsfoss.community/t/how-to-create-a-persitent-bootable-windows-10-usb-in-linux/9586/40?page=2
Feb 22 17:10:46 <CptLuxx>	its als not TPM,CPU,Secureboot related you dont need any bypass
Feb 22 17:12:30 <Pr070cal_>	OK but woeusb won't install suso pip3 install . won't work
Feb 22 17:12:46 <CptLuxx>	OR use the other methode as in the link
Feb 22 17:12:58 <Pr070cal_>	Which link
Feb 22 17:12:59 <CptLuxx>	that makes a hybrid iso out of the windows.iso that you can ACTUALLY USE with dd
Feb 22 17:13:02 <CptLuxx>	[17:10:30] <CptLuxx> use woeusb or the other methode https://itsfoss.community/t/how-to-create-a-persitent-bootable-windows-10-usb-in-linux/9586/40?page=2
Feb 22 17:14:02 <CptLuxx>	"So what you need to do is convert it to hybrid
Feb 22 17:14:02 <CptLuxx>	isohybrid filename.iso
Feb 22 17:14:02 <CptLuxx>	It converts the file, does not make a new file"
Feb 22 17:14:11 <CptLuxx>	or woeusb... srsly

Feb 22 21:41:52 <Dex2x>	Hi all, is there any way to swap to ldac or apx for bluetooth devices in windows ?
Feb 22 21:44:57 <Pr070cal_>	Hi guys went to rest had no joy
Feb 22 21:45:25 <Pr070cal_>	Can someone run Rufus for me make an IMG and DCC it to me please
Feb 22 21:45:40 <TheFatherMind>	We do not do that stuff here.
Feb 22 21:45:58 <Pr070cal_>	Someone stole my laptop and I can't make a USB drive in windows
Feb 22 21:45:59 <TheFatherMind>	If you want an ISO of the windows install get it from the Microsoft website.
Feb 22 21:46:46 <TheFatherMind>	Ah.. so there is a difference between asking for your perceived solution and telling us the actual problem.  We have an answer to that problem...
Feb 22 21:46:55 <Pr070cal_>	I wrote it to a SD and when I run it it says load driver there's a driver missing
Feb 22 21:47:28 <TheFatherMind>		If you use dd you will get "Missing drivers" during the install.
Feb 22 21:47:28 <TheFatherMind>		https://github.com/liberawindows/WindowsUsbCreator
Feb 22 21:48:02 <TheFatherMind>	or... 	Use WoeUSB to make the Live Flash Drive instead..  woeusb --partition Win11-ISO-Name.iso /dev/sd<x>
Feb 22 21:48:03 <TheFatherMind>		https://github.com/WoeUSB/WoeUSB#required
Feb 22 21:51:35 <S_SubZero>	make a friend near you with Windows and ask them to make a USB
Feb 22 21:52:28 <TheFatherMind>	Get a sharpie and cardbord box.. make a sign.. "Need friends with Windows" and hold it on the street corner?
Feb 22 21:53:16 <S_SubZero>	There is a >0% chance that would be successful
Feb 22 21:57:14 <gurki>	id probably stop :3
Feb 22 21:57:25 <gurki>	sounds like a fun conversation
Feb 22 22:07:26 <TheFatherMind>	heh
Feb 22 22:07:39 <TheFatherMind>	I almost want to try this just to see what would happen.
Feb 22 22:40:14 <guideX>	why would anyone want to use anything other than the windows media creator website
Feb 22 22:41:00 <TheFatherMind>	Because they are not bold enough to stand on the corner with a sign looking for, "A new Windows friend".
Feb 22 22:41:42 <TheFatherMind>	I am surprised we have not come up with some secure tech that allows users to just specify an OS and the computer will pull it down and apply it.
Feb 22 22:43:59 <guideX>	I've been in this situation before with both mac and windows, in both situations, I simply went to best buy or some other store, and used the computers there to create a flash drive
Feb 22 22:44:20 <TheFatherMind>	Very clever1
Feb 22 23:00:04 <gurki>	TheFatherMind: iirc macs will do just that
Feb 22 23:00:22 <gurki>	well. you dont get to specify, really :3
Feb 22 23:11:34 <TheFatherMind>	True true.. well... WELP.... I guess I am leaving you all in #Windows for #MacOS....
Feb 22 23:11:57 *	TheFatherMind parts the channel (GOING MAC!)
Feb 22 23:18:29 <S_SubZero>	Macs can "PXE boot over the internet" to Apple and download an image. This is because it's all one locked in thing. Windows *has* a version of this but it's finicky cuz it's only for businesses and is OEM-specific
Feb 22 23:23:41 <S_SubZero>	a company can give Lenovo etc. a preconfigured image, and then they have a way to also PXE boot over the internet and it gets that image.
Feb 22 23:24:13 <TheFatherMind>	I just feel like all PC's should allow us to decide where that image comes from.
Feb 22 23:26:53 <S_SubZero>	That Ventoy thing, they are tinkering with an iPXE to let one have a server to do basically that.  Instead of a USB stick it's a server
Feb 22 23:28:46 <TheFatherMind>	Oh that is clever.
Feb 22 23:29:10 <TheFatherMind>	There is an alternative to Ventoy I have been meaning to look at.  I heavily rely on injection though.  So I hope it does that too.
Feb 22 23:39:15 <guideX>	actually, with the mac, I needed to use a mac as a mac build host for a xamarin/c# app I was building
Feb 22 23:39:47 <guideX>	ah no problem, enable developer stuff, add the best buy mac to my apple id, use xamarin real quick, all done xD
Feb 23 00:04:23 <gurki>	TheFatherMind: you might like wds / sccm
Feb 23 00:05:40 <gurki>	its quite trivial to setup imho. pretty much automated way to install via pxe
Feb 23 00:05:43 <TheFatherMind>	Mmm not really in my wheelhouse.
Feb 23 00:06:30 <TheFatherMind>	I thought it would be neat.. But for what I do.. having the OS on a flash drive and then being able to attach to the flash drive remotely.. backup the data, apply an image.. restore the data.. that is key.
Feb 23 00:07:11 <gurki>	well if youre dealing with a nail a screwdriver doesnt get yoi very far :)
Feb 23 00:07:27 <gurki>	you*
Feb 23 00:58:02 <Pr070cal_>	Hi guys its now working I have the best solution
Feb 23 00:58:23 <Pr070cal_>	You need to format SD to exfat
Feb 23 00:58:34 <Pr070cal_>	Then mount win11.iso
Feb 23 00:58:45 <Pr070cal_>	Then copy contents to sd
Feb 23 00:58:52 <Pr070cal_>	Eject and boot
Feb 23 00:58:59 <TheFatherMind>	That is not the best solution.
Feb 23 00:59:23 <TheFatherMind>	https://github.com/liberawindows/WindowsUsbCreator
Feb 23 00:59:35 <TheFatherMind>	or... 	Use WoeUSB to make the Live Flash Drive instead..  woeusb --partition Win11-ISO-Name.iso /dev/sd<x>
Feb 23 00:59:36 <TheFatherMind>	https://github.com/WoeUSB/WoeUSB#required
Feb 23 00:59:45 <TheFatherMind>	That 👆 is the best solution.
Feb 23 00:59:45 <Pr070cal_>	Then search for bypasstpmcheck and use shift f10 and regedit to enter the checks
Feb 23 01:00:05 <Pr070cal_>	I couldn't get woeusb working
Feb 23 01:00:30 <TheFatherMind>	Well then you should let us know.. What part of https://github.com/liberawindows/WindowsUsbCreator did you get stuck on?
Feb 23 01:01:38 <Pr070cal_>	Sudo pip3 install . wouldn't work
Feb 23 01:01:50 <Pr070cal_>	I found mounting the iso easier
Feb 23 01:02:04 <Pr070cal_>	Then just copied its contents over
Feb 23 01:02:17 <Pr070cal_>	And formatting to exfat is easier
Feb 23 01:02:25 <TheFatherMind>	Please define "would't work"
Feb 23 01:02:25 <Pr070cal_>	And quicker
Feb 23 01:02:39 <Pr070cal_>	Won't install no module
Feb 23 01:02:47 <TheFatherMind>	Exact error?
Feb 23 01:03:09 <Pr070cal_>	Can't remember
Feb 23 01:03:31 <Pr070cal_>	No woeusb module loaded or sometjing
Feb 23 01:14:11 <nshire>	I ended up installing a quick kvm instance, passing the usb controller through, and using the windows vm to write the installer
Feb 23 01:14:44 <nshire>	it sounds long and contrived but it was actually really easy and required fewer steps than the other solutions
Feb 23 01:15:33 <TheFatherMind>	Yeah using Windows to make Windows is really the best choice.  (:
Feb 23 01:15:49 <TheFatherMind>	so Pr070cal_ are you saying you have completely installed windows using your method?
Feb 23 01:17:16 <gurki>	nshire: actually sounds like the straightforward thing to do :)
Feb 23 01:17:54 <nshire>	I did it on a dual core ultrathin laptop from 2016 so the install time was annoying. but I just took a shower and did other things during that.
Feb 23 01:18:22 <nshire>	does removing network access during install let you continue installation and use local accounts like win10 did?
Feb 23 01:19:02 <TheFatherMind>	There is a command you can run during the install to make that happen.
Feb 23 01:19:02 <nshire>	I forgot to remove the virtual network adapter so I did have to do the annoying rigamarole of signing in and all that stuff
Feb 23 01:20:25 <TheFatherMind>	Shift+F10 -> "OOBE\BYPASSNRO" <enter> -> "I do not have internet" -> "Connect with limited setup"
Feb 23 01:20:32 <TheFatherMind>	(Computer may reboot after you press enter.  This will also allow you to create a local account since there is no network.)
Feb 23 01:22:14 <nshire>	do you have to remove internet for that to work?
Feb 23 01:22:30 <TheFatherMind>	I do not believe you do.
Feb 23 01:22:39 <nshire>	oh wow. I'll have to take note of that
Feb 23 01:22:41 <TheFatherMind>	Let me know.
Feb 23 01:22:57 <nshire>	well, I have no need to install win11 any time soon. I hope
Feb 23 01:23:08 <nshire>	I could spin up a hyperv vm and test
Feb 23 01:23:11 <TheFatherMind>	😊👍
Feb 23 02:49:30 <Tripknotix>	is there a way to download WinForms.dll from framework 4.x.x , i dont seem to have it on my pc in the /windows/ folder
Feb 23 02:49:37 <Tripknotix>	a safe way
Feb 23 02:50:40 <TheFatherMind>	That looks like a C lib... can you not just install the C runtime?
Feb 23 02:51:41 <TheFatherMind>	Oh no it is .NET
Feb 23 02:51:49 <TheFatherMind>	Just Install the .NET Framework SDK
Feb 23 02:52:23 <TheFatherMind>	 You can download it from the official Microsoft website or install it through the Visual Studio installer.
Feb 23 02:53:10 <TheFatherMind>	https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
Feb 23 03:00:23 <nshire>	hyperv has an eol date?
Feb 23 03:02:03 <nshire>	or did it just get lumped into windows server
Feb 23 03:16:18 <TheFatherMind>	Hyper-V is not an OS.. it is more of an App like MS Office.
Feb 23 03:22:52 <TheFatherMind>	Hyper-V does not have a specified end-of-life date. Its lifecycle generally aligns with the Windows Server release it's part of, so each version of Hyper-V will be supported as long as its corresponding Windows Server version is supported. Always check with Microsoft for the most current information on product lifecycle policies.
Feb 23 03:22:56 <TheFatherMind>	So says Jacey
Feb 23 04:18:46 <nshire>	hyper v was an os
Feb 23 04:19:27 <nshire>	hyper-v server
Feb 23 07:05:40 <Your_Dog>	i am a long time firefox user and I love my setup. But just for the sake of trying Microsoft's constant attempts of trying Edge I must say. Edge has become really really good.
Feb 23 07:06:14 <TheFatherMind>	Yeah, edge is Chrome with a Microsoft Face.
Feb 23 07:06:42 <Your_Dog>	I know, I just like the niceties they added like vertical tabs, some built in image editor and all
Feb 23 07:06:53 <Your_Dog>	Although I still prefer my vertical tab setup with sideberry on FF
Feb 23 07:07:02 <Your_Dog>	but hey credit where credit is due
Feb 23 07:07:18 <TheFatherMind>	I have a vertical tab extension running in Chrome... it does help a lot.
Feb 23 07:08:16 <TheFatherMind>	What I really like the plugin that lets me program pressing my ESC twice to close a tab and scroll though open tabs with the mouse wheel.  I can also hold shift while anywhere over the browser and hit the mouse wheel and I scroll through tabs.
Feb 23 07:10:39 <Your_Dog>	i do admit yeah the vertical scrolling on edge doesnt have that (by default atleast) but on sideberry yeah its there
Feb 23 07:26:39 <ilne>	any idea how a 'concerned citizen' goes about reporting an issue with Edge and PDF viewing when certain PDFs don't allow you to copy content from them, and this only happens in Edge (other browsers and popular readers work just fine)
Feb 23 07:27:07 <ilne>	ideally one would log a ticket with MS but i don't have that option
Feb 23 07:27:13 <TheFatherMind>	There is a feedback form built into Windows 11
Feb 23 07:27:31 <TheFatherMind>	Also make sure you test it from Private/Incognito Mode.
Feb 23 07:27:36 <ilne>	did that
Feb 23 07:27:44 <TheFatherMind>	Then your job is done.
Feb 23 07:28:00 <ilne>	feedback from, yeah, didn't come to think of it, thanks
Feb 23 07:28:03 <TheFatherMind>	You can also post in their forums.. but that is not MS... That is just people like us.
Feb 23 07:28:11 <ilne>	yeah this i figure
Feb 23 07:28:17 <TheFatherMind>	😊👍
Feb 23 07:31:04 <ilne>	we've a workaround but it's a bit tricky for end users, edge://flags/ and set New PDF Viewer to enabled, it forces adobe reader to be used instead of edge native
Feb 23 07:38:44 <eson123>	i am wondering, how can an executable manage to pop up a Trusted UCA popup when one run it as Administrator ? does it have to be sent to Microsoft or someone and they agree that the executable is no malicious software ?
Feb 23 07:40:12 <TheFatherMind>	Are you talking about a User Account Control (UAC) prompts in Windows operating systems. When you run an executable with elevated privileges?
Feb 23 09:08:43 <cocucka>	How to remove edge if I am not from freedomEuropa?
Feb 23 09:21:49 <TheFatherMind>	See if this helps you cocucka: https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-uninstall-microsoft-edge
Feb 23 10:25:14 <cocucka>	@TheFatherMind, no, I have Windows LastVersion Pro.

Feb 23 14:52:18 <voker57>	my games don't even use network
Feb 23 14:54:50 <chair1>	I'm can't troubleshoot your problem. I'd suspect the motherboard buses are busy with the game and they strangle networking capabilities
Feb 23 14:55:05 <chair1>	I dunno if this even makes sense
Feb 23 14:55:32 <chair1>	I'm told some people overlook the importance of mobos and buy cheap ones for expensive setups and... something bad happens? but what happens? I dunno
Feb 23 14:57:22 <chair1>	or maybe your network is high-speed, but connections errors increase and force more error correction and replicated packets that slows down "actual" bandwidth
Feb 23 14:57:25 <chair1>	guesses
Feb 23 14:57:54 <chair1>	and errors increase due to heat or because the CPU can't read from network buffer fast enough
Feb 23 14:58:07 <chair1>	a full buffer forces packets to be dropped
Feb 23 14:58:19 <chair1>	time to lunch, good luck
Feb 23 14:58:23 <H4ndy>	voker57: what NIC is your computer using? Also check if you have any software with a weird game mode like Antivirus or
Feb 23 15:00:23 <voker57>	Realtek, the motherboard is Asus X670-P
Feb 23 15:00:55 <voker57>	no antivirus, I also suspect it's some kind of hw vendor bloatware but couldn't find any settings like that
Feb 23 15:06:22 <H4ndy>	hmm weird, I am also sporting a Realtek 2.5GE onboard card and don't suffer from the same fate 🤔 (X570 chipset)
Feb 23 15:20:58 <voker57>	actually that gave me an idea, I purged some Lenovo software that was left over from when that system was on a laptop and the issue seems to be solved
Feb 23 15:20:59 <voker57>	thanks
Feb 23 15:50:52 <tyson2>	lenovo software rarely adds value
Feb 23 16:38:05 <CrtxReavr>	On *nix, you can run "route get (ip|network)" and it will print the route in the routing table that matches the ip or network you specify.
Feb 23 16:38:15 <CrtxReavr>	There an equivlent in Windows?
Feb 23 16:39:17 <CrtxReavr>	tyson2, Lenovo Vantage adds value. . . but that's probably about it.
Feb 23 16:57:04 <tyson2>	CrtxReavr: agree
Feb 23 17:35:48 <Thuryn>	what's a good microsoft reference site for event ids and documentation?

Feb 23 17:45:18 <cappy>	Thuryn: Go #Windows-Legacy and ask the Jacey bot.
Feb 23 17:47:44 <Thuryn>	totally unhelpful response from bot.
Feb 23 17:54:53 <Thuryn>	this doesn't appear to exist.  i am immeasurably disappointed.
Feb 23 18:07:35 <S_SubZero>	it tends to work better the other way around.  Have an existing Event ID you're curious about, and look it up in [search engine]. Hopefully there's a stackoverflow explanation of it.
Feb 23 18:55:29 <sem>	I have an old ~2014 hp pavilion dm3 laptop which is having trouble booting linux kernels from USB. My plan is to install windows to try and upgrade the bios
Feb 23 18:55:53 <sem>	question 1: am I right to assume that windows 10 would be preferable than win 7 (I am not sure if it is EOL)
Feb 23 18:57:30 <S_SubZero>	Windows 7 went EoL in January 2020.
Feb 23 18:59:26 <sem>	ok, thanks
Feb 23 19:02:35 <Thuryn>	S_SubZero, in this case, even that isn't working.
Feb 23 19:02:54 <Thuryn>	i keep turning up documentation for Windows Server 2008, even though this same event ID is still in use
Feb 23 19:03:17 <Thuryn>	plus, I was really looking for some sort of authoritative documentation that I could link to.  apparently, there is no such thing.
Feb 23 19:05:34 <S_SubZero>	if you wanted an EventIDpedia, I'd think such a thing would be a beast to maintain.
Feb 23 19:05:49 <S_SubZero>	what Event ID do you have?
Feb 23 19:05:50 <Thuryn>	not for MS
Feb 23 19:06:50 <Thuryn>	7034 - 7040
Feb 23 19:07:57 <drew>	I can't connect to the wsl2 instance on my w11 computer. I am doing a "port forward" as described here: https://superuser.com/a/1758197 but I am still getting timouts on the other hosts on my network trying to connect
Feb 23 19:09:04 <sem>	I am putting win8 installation media on a USB drive with Rufus -- however it says "target system" is UEFI (non CSM) and I am sure that this laptop uses BIOS not uefi. Will this be a problem?
Feb 23 19:09:07 <S_SubZero>	looks like 7034 is "service terminated unexpectedly"
Feb 23 19:09:52 <drew>	`ip addr show` in the wsl2 instance shows 192.168.105.87 on eth0 so I did `netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3632 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3632 connectaddress=192.168.105.87`
Feb 23 19:10:36 <drew>	Is there something I still need to do to get the ports to go through? or is this the wrong way to do this maybe?

Feb 23 19:20:08 <Thuryn>	S_SubZero, yes, i know.
Feb 23 19:24:20 <Thuryn>	S_SubZero, the problem is:  what's an appropriate place to link to as documentation for how that event ID is defined.
Feb 23 19:25:22 <Thuryn>	for example:  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/search/?terms=event%20id%207034
Feb 23 19:37:22 <drew>	are there logs or something where I can see connection attempts? I don't even know where Windows is killing the connection attempts to WSL2
Feb 23 19:37:34 <RelayChat>	you can do that with procmon
Feb 23 19:37:49 <S_SubZero>	Thuryn: I dunno.. https://www.myeventlog.com/ ?
Feb 23 19:40:01 <Thuryn>	S_SubZero, doesn't know event id 4098 (first one I tried)
Feb 23 19:42:01 <Thuryn>	eventid.net seems to be down
Feb 23 19:42:37 <Mathisen>	Thuryn, ask jacey in social channel it knows what the id is for
Feb 23 19:43:10 <Thuryn>	Mathisen, it knows, but doesn't provide a reference.
Feb 23 19:52:48 <S_SubZero>	ok so very clearly a 100% flawless, perfect list of every single Event ID in the history of Windows.. doesn't exist.
Feb 23 19:56:09 <zyme>	heh
Feb 23 19:56:42 <zyme>	there's many times when it's not very helpful so.. I can see ppl not caring for a list..

Feb 24 19:13:26 <lupinxjigen>	it's a normal 1tb HDD
Feb 24 19:13:37 <RelayChat>	did you use dd on linux to make the usb drive?
Feb 24 19:13:41 <lupinxjigen>	no
Feb 24 19:13:46 <lupinxjigen>	I used ventoy
Feb 24 19:13:52 <lupinxjigen>	and used wimboot
Feb 24 19:14:02 <lupinxjigen>	it's one of the pictures
Feb 24 19:14:20 <RelayChat>	dd and i think ventoy as well cause issues

Feb 25 04:04:38 <LooCfur_>	windows fax and scan says I have no scanner all of a sudden.
Feb 25 04:04:47 <LooCfur_>	under devices and Printers, the printer/scanner shows up
Feb 25 04:04:58 <LooCfur_>	it always used to work. Any ideas?
Feb 25 04:05:14 <LooCfur_>	I went and used another computer to do the scanning because I couldn't get this one to work
Feb 25 04:05:19 <LooCfur_>	so the scanner itself works
Feb 25 04:13:25 <LooCfur_>	the printer actually doesn't show up under printers in device manager, however
Feb 25 04:13:28 <LooCfur_>	I'm confused
Feb 25 04:13:45 <LooCfur_>	I never uninstalled it, and it worked fine for years
Feb 25 04:13:54 <LooCfur_>	I never messed with anything, and all of a sudden, it doesn't work
Feb 25 04:25:44 <LooCfur_>	well now it works
Feb 25 04:25:45 <LooCfur_>	so weird
Feb 25 06:03:23 <carbonfiber>	How did windows sysadmins automate administration of windows servers before powershell existed? for example, if an admin needed to install or update an executable on 50 servers, then how would he have done it? RDP into each machine?
Feb 25 06:25:43 <A-KO>	we didn't
Feb 25 06:25:49 <A-KO>	powershell's been around since 2005
Feb 25 06:25:54 <A-KO>	I mean, we did, it was all VBS though
Feb 25 06:25:58 <A-KO>	it wasn't pretty
Feb 25 06:26:20 <A-KO>	SMS Server (now SCCM/MECM)
Feb 25 06:26:48 <A-KO>	but if you weren't large enough or competent enough for SMS, then yeah
Feb 25 06:26:56 <A-KO>	RDP and VBS it was :D
Feb 25 06:27:24 <A-KO>	PowerShell is around 19-20 years old or so now. Which is ancient history in tech land
Feb 25 06:28:00 <A-KO>	Commodore 64 was the hot thing 20 years before PowerShell ; and now it's been that long since powershell was created.
Feb 25 06:28:42 <A-KO>	so these days I think "pre-powershell" is kind of pointless to think about......as it's no different than thinking "How did we do networking before the internet?"
Feb 25 06:42:08 <carbonfiber>	yeah well I think the history is interesting. But your right that powershell has been around for a long time.
Feb 25 06:44:13 <carbonfiber>	what about telnet? any reason for using RDP instead of telnet?
Feb 25 06:44:37 <TheFatherMind>	There is no reason to ever use telnet
Feb 25 06:45:38 <carbonfiber>	well I imagine that there might have been in the 90s
Feb 25 06:54:37 <akik>	ssh is from the 90s
Feb 25 07:07:51 <TheFatherMind>	LOL
Feb 25 07:08:20 <TheFatherMind>	It was very popular in the 90's.. We used to use it to connect to our BBS's and play MUDDs
Feb 25 07:45:41 <akik>	putty seems to be from 1999
Feb 25 07:46:26 <akik>	i found a bug in putty last year. it doesn't check whether a local port is already in use for a tunnel
Feb 25 07:51:57 <eawfaw>	What is the best command in window to do a daily backup of some files to a network location? I'm hoping some copy that will be smart about failures, and verify that the copied content matches 100% the original, etc....
Feb 25 07:53:06 <cocucka>	ssh from 90s is TELNET
Feb 25 07:53:39 <akik>	uhh
Feb 25 07:53:43 <akik>	ssh is from 1995
Feb 25 07:53:51 <cocucka>	putty on windows in 2024?
Feb 25 07:54:18 <akik>	read up
Feb 25 07:55:11 <eawfaw>	the network location is accessible on windows
Feb 25 07:55:18 <eawfaw>	so I just need some copy command
Feb 25 07:55:40 <cocucka>	eawfaw, copy or sync?
Feb 25 07:59:46 <eawfaw>	k, thx
Feb 25 08:00:21 <eawfaw>	another question, does windows comes by default with any other scripting languages other than .cmd, powershell, .vbs, and .js?
Feb 25 08:51:26 <TheFatherMind>	eawfaw https://duplicati.com
Feb 25 08:51:38 <TheFatherMind>	Or use ROBOCOPY
Feb 25 08:51:54 <TheFatherMind>	Then setup a task in the task sheculer
Feb 25 08:51:57 <TheFatherMind>	* scheduler
Feb 25 08:52:37 <TheFatherMind>	Or you could also use https://syncthing.net/

Feb 29 01:38:00 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	CptLuxx it didnt werk
Feb 29 01:38:09 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	obviously why would it have
Feb 29 01:40:15 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	https://i.ibb.co/rF7W1nC/Capture.png
Feb 29 01:40:17 <TheFatherMind>	I expanded my partition to 1.5gb and it did not work for me either.  I read on line that it really is an MS problem and not ours and not to worry about it.   But that is easier said than done.
Feb 29 01:41:01 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	so it refuses to create the recovery partition at the end of the table this thing keeps creating it back at the beginning even after i delete it
Feb 29 01:41:19 <TheFatherMind>	I may personally dig into this further in the next few days.  So if you do not resolve it ping me and I will tell you if I have figured it out.
Feb 29 01:41:23 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	their disk management tool doesnt even show the 5 partitions
Feb 29 01:41:35 <TheFatherMind>	4 partitions.
Feb 29 01:41:47 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	shouldnt reserved be listed
Feb 29 01:42:09 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	gparted shows it
Feb 29 01:42:59 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	know what i think ill give up as this castle of card might fail and ill have a bad day, i retried the windoze update and it just magically worked today
Feb 29 01:43:11 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	even tho the recovery partition is the exact same size as before
Feb 29 01:43:17 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	makes sens 👍
Feb 29 10:32:46 <andre144k>	hello all. windows10 is showing in SETTINGS menu more monoitors then as connected. when i delete them in device manager, they willbe found againg.
Feb 29 10:33:03 <wyre>	what's the powershell equivalent cmdlet for 'net use' ?
Feb 29 10:33:03 <andre144k>	the current physically monitor is conneted via display port
Feb 29 10:33:17 <andre144k>	anyone have an idea?
Feb 29 10:34:04 <CptLuxx>	new-psdrive wyre
Feb 29 10:34:26 <CptLuxx>	or new-smbmapping
Feb 29 10:38:21 <wyre>	What's the different between those two?
Feb 29 10:43:43 <CptLuxx>	#powershell
Feb 29 11:44:47 <mh_le>	how do I get Outlook to use chrome when opening links?
Feb 29 12:10:49 <OurRoyalGabe>	I remove Edge and WebView and it usually resolves everything
Feb 29 12:17:02 <CptLuxx>	go in the outlook settings and change the default browser there..
Feb 29 13:15:13 <fweht>	new to windows, is chocolatey or winget the equaivalent to brew on mac?
Feb 29 13:16:00 <CptLuxx>	what is brew?
Feb 29 13:22:26 <lembron>	kinda yes
Feb 29 13:23:41 <fweht>	CptLuxx: its kind of the default package manager for mac, though not officially
Feb 29 13:23:46 <fweht>	lembron: which of the two?
Feb 29 13:25:48 <lembron>	"more choco than winget" you could say i guess
Feb 29 13:29:32 <fweht>	lembron: thanks!
Feb 29 13:43:27 <anddam>	howdy, I am on windows 11 Home trying to connect to mysql at 127.0.0.1:3306, the server forbids me because the credentials I am using are for @localhost where apparently I am connecting from 172.17.0.1
Feb 29 13:43:36 <anddam>	considering this is my network setup https://termbin.com/tnta where is that 172.17.0.1 coming from??
Feb 29 13:45:40 <CptLuxx>	how about you give more details?
Feb 29 13:45:52 <CptLuxx>	is the mysql server a vm? wsl? a container?
Feb 29 13:48:03 <anddam>	sure, mysql is a docker container, I think Docker is using Hyper-V due to the last sections of ipconfig's output
Feb 29 13:48:17 <anddam>	that's more or less the whole extent of what I know
Feb 29 13:48:57 <anddam>	bingo, it's the docker network gateway
Feb 29 13:49:00 <CptLuxx>	its using wsl with hyperv..
Feb 29 13:49:39 <anddam>	right, it's written right there (oops)

Feb 29 14:16:44 <lembron>	anddam thats odd - what mysql server? the library mysql image certainly has a "%" in there... ((not 1000% sure about root user, but the user-user certainly does))
Feb 29 14:18:43 <lembron>	but "credentials I am using are for @localhost" doesnt rly fit to that either - "most" things try to find some mysql.sock(et) file when specifically given "localhost" so doublecheck that maybe...

Feb 29 14:42:36 <anddam>	or rather I didn't even check, I created mine
Feb 29 14:43:39 <anddam>	I used HeidiSQL (GUI program) and mysql from CLI, the destination host I am using is 127.0.0.1 though, not "localhost"
Feb 29 14:44:29 <anddam>	lembron: I checked, there's no user account ready on the freshly spun container
Feb 29 14:44:54 <lembron>	it will make a user-user when you provide MYSQL_USER & MYSQL_PASSWORD env-vars^
Feb 29 14:45:01 <lembron>	https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/blob/master/docker-entrypoint.sh#L312C36-L312C50
Feb 29 14:45:10 <anddam>	oh, I should learn how to read probably
Feb 29 14:45:12 <anddam>	thanks
Feb 29 14:45:24 <anddam>	I just accessed as root and created user and db
Feb 29 14:47:13 <lembron>	either is kinda fine rly - just wanted to make sure you arent attempting to build your own mysql-image (or attempt to install it into another container and turn it into a "fat" container :P) - cause ye, the normal install of mysql packages cuts that all down (also listens only on 127.0.0.1 by default, where in dockerland everything listens on 0.0.0.0 generally ;-))
Feb 29 14:51:49 <anddam>	no I needed a mysql server on the fly and I was on windoze, not bothering with building images
Feb 29 14:52:06 <anddam>	I was just puzzled by the denied access, I figure it's ok with the virtual network
Feb 29 14:52:13 <anddam>	thx for the insights

Feb 29 18:05:28 <osc4rpt>	Muligan: netstat -a?
Feb 29 18:06:10 <naphtali>	You can also use Resource Monitor
Feb 29 18:08:16 <Muligan>	'System'

Feb 29 19:31:52 <arkanoid>	would you explain me why desktop.ini files seems to not work anymore after being copied elsewhere?
Feb 29 19:32:51 <TheFatherMind>	Does it still have the S and H attributes?
Feb 29 19:33:13 <arkanoid>	mh, possibly not
Feb 29 19:33:16 <arkanoid>	let me check
Feb 29 19:33:56 <RelayChat>	keep in mind that one of them is actually in C:\Users\%username%\Desktop while the other one is in C:\Users\Public\Desktop, even though they both appear on the same desktop
Feb 29 19:40:55 <arkanoid>	I can confirm that the tool I am using to copy files is not copying the S and H attributes of desktop.ini files
Feb 29 19:43:25 <TheFatherMind>	you can fix them with the cmd attrib tool.  May need to run an elevated command prompt.
Feb 29 19:44:22 <TheFatherMind>	Teracopy is a good tool to copy stuff.. as well as the built in robocopy

Mar 01 03:53:05 <naphtali>	DOGEMEMEGOD_D, I have recreated many of them lately. It's not too bad. Use this guide: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5028997-instructions-to-manually-resize-your-partition-to-install-the-winre-update-400faa27-9343-461c-ada9-24c8229763bf
Mar 01 03:53:13 <naphtali>	I would suggest you use 750MB
Mar 01 03:53:48 <uprayedd>	TheFatherMind: to install windows on a usb in Linux (and have it to work for sure). what software would you use
Mar 01 03:54:06 <TheFatherMind>	Ah...
Mar 01 03:55:01 <TheFatherMind>	We have an official solution for that:  https://github.com/liberawindows/WindowsUsbCreator
Mar 01 03:55:20 <TheFatherMind>	I believe Mathisen created that page.  It is very well done.  Lot of respect there.
Mar 01 03:56:06 <TheFatherMind>	I believe that may be a simplified, automated version of this: woeusb --partition Win11-ISO-Name.iso /dev/sd<x>
Mar 01 03:56:06 <TheFatherMind>			https://github.com/WoeUSB/WoeUSB#required
Mar 01 03:56:29 <RelayChat>	yeah the woeusb requirements are too much
Mar 01 03:57:01 <TheFatherMind>	That is the channels official solution.. what I do??
Mar 01 03:57:14 <TheFatherMind>	I install Ventoy on a flash drive then get the ISO from microsoft and boot to it from Ventoy.
Mar 01 03:57:57 <naphtali>	[20:57] <TheFatherMind> That is the channels official solution.. what I do??  <-- Fall in line or be banished to #legacy
Mar 01 03:59:12 <TheFatherMind>	LOL LOL LOL
Mar 01 03:59:21 <TheFatherMind>	That is funny.. because that is exactly what happened.
Mar 01 03:59:53 <THE_GFR|WORK>	naphtali: gotta love that update that Microsoft released that has to have partitions resized.  Stupid if you ask me.  Fails all the time.
Mar 01 04:00:00 <THE_GFR|WORK>	we fix it all the time lol
Mar 01 04:00:15 <naphtali>	The MS supplied script works some of the time
Mar 01 04:00:20 <THE_GFR|WORK>	oh
Mar 01 04:00:23 <THE_GFR|WORK>	they have a script?
Mar 01 04:00:29 <naphtali>	They have 2
Mar 01 04:00:31 <THE_GFR|WORK>	I just resize manually and boom done
Mar 01 04:00:36 <THE_GFR|WORK>	huh
Mar 01 04:00:39 <THE_GFR|WORK>	they have a script
Mar 01 04:00:41 <naphtali>	One will apply the fix without resizing
Mar 01 04:00:42 <THE_GFR|WORK>	link please?
Mar 01 04:00:53 <THE_GFR|WORK>	but you have to resize
Mar 01 04:00:56 <naphtali>	The earlier one will attempt to resize it for you
Mar 01 04:01:06 <naphtali>	Please hold the line
Mar 01 04:01:10 <THE_GFR|WORK>	so the resize is the proper thing
Mar 01 04:01:13 <THE_GFR|WORK>	naphtali: ty
Mar 01 04:04:39 <naphtali>	https://pastebin.com/rk1kCHvC
Mar 01 04:04:47 <naphtali>	That's the resize script
Mar 01 04:04:57 <naphtali>	I am still trying to find the MS page with that source
Mar 01 04:05:17 <naphtali>	The 2nd one https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5034957-updating-the-winre-partition-on-deployed-devices-to-address-security-vulnerabilities-in-cve-2024-20666-0190331b-1ca3-42d8-8a55-7fc406910c10
Mar 01 04:05:33 <THE_GFR|WORK>	ty naphtali
Mar 01 04:07:28 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	naphtali it doesnt werk
Mar 01 04:07:58 <naphtali>	What doesn't work
Mar 01 04:10:24 <naphtali>	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/add-update-to-winre?view=windows-11#extend-the-windows-re-partition
Mar 01 04:10:34 <naphtali>	There it is GFR
Mar 01 04:21:51 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	naphtali: https://i.ibb.co/N6ZB34V/Capture.png
Mar 01 04:23:57 <naphtali>	reagentc /enable results in what?
Mar 01 04:24:39 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	my recovery is partition 1 so i delete it, i resize my os partition 4 to leave 2gb at the end of the table, i create a ntfs partition in this new free space with disk management and when i return to diskpart to run the create partition and gpt attribute commands i always end up it creates it back to the beginning of the table where partition 1 was initialy so it ends up the same size im running in cicrles
Mar 01 04:25:00 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	i dont remember im not home but i had no errors
Mar 01 04:25:59 <naphtali>	hmm... I have not had that happen
Mar 01 04:26:08 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	so now i just have a 2gb partiton at the end of my table that i want it to become the recovery partition but i dont understand how to force it to use this partition5
Mar 01 04:26:20 <naphtali>	And I have had a number of machines with the WinRE at the beginning of the disk
Mar 01 04:26:47 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	im not gonna move all my partitions to leave 2gb at the beginning u knkw what i mean
Mar 01 04:27:40 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	i sel part 5 then create partition primary id=de94bba4-06d1-4d40-a16a-bfd50179d6ac and i still end up partition 1 is the recovery one being created
Mar 01 04:29:01 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	see the disk management sees partition 1 fs as "recovery partition" but partition 5 as "basic data partition"
Mar 01 04:29:20 <naphtali>	Sorry, I have not experienced that issue
Mar 01 04:29:29 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	nowhere in disk management i can choose a fs type of "recovery" when making fs on partition 5
Mar 01 04:29:33 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	thats dumb
Mar 01 04:29:35 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	alrights
Mar 01 04:29:42 <naphtali>	I have never used Disk Management in the process
Mar 01 04:29:55 <naphtali>	I am not sure if it's related
Mar 01 04:29:57 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	i might try again
Mar 01 04:30:29 <naphtali>	I wonder if ragentc /info lists Partition 1 as your WinRE
Mar 01 04:30:45 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	ill chexk tomorrow wen at home
Mar 01 04:31:08 <naphtali>	Have you tried deleting Partition 1 first?
Mar 01 04:31:40 <naphtali>	oh, I see you have
Mar 01 04:32:27 <naphtali>	You also might try making the WinRE partition smaller. Maybe it thinks the 2GB volume should be used for something else
Mar 01 04:32:37 <naphtali>	I think 750MB should be sufficent
Mar 01 04:33:37 <naphtali>	I am going to bed
Mar 01 04:58:04 <DOGEMEMEGOD_D>	hrm
Mar 01 08:06:40 <nshire>	at some point I hope microsoft kills off kernel-mode anticheats
Mar 01 08:42:03 <TheFatherMind>	So that you can cheat?
Mar 01 08:43:59 <zyme>	nah, Microsoft will use ChatGPT NPC's to stop the cheaters...
Mar 01 08:57:23 <CptLuxx>	no need to kill off kernel anticheats
Mar 01 08:57:25 <CptLuxx>	its the best way
