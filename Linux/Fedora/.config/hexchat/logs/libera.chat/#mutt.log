Feb 21 15:52:06 <mingdao>	I have an ascii(?) penguin in my sig, and want to add a mutt logo similar.  https://imgur.com/LDGGQaP.png
Feb 21 15:52:15 <mingdao>	Anyone know where I can get one?
Feb 21 15:56:25 <mingdao>	I've searched quite a bit and can only find this guy https://0x0.st/H5Zv.png

Feb 21 18:48:53 <rkta>	The empty line seems to break mutts signature parsing.
Feb 21 19:09:30 <mingdao>	rkta: I don't see that here, if I understand you.
Feb 21 19:16:50 <rkta>	mingdao: On you picture, the signature is in blue color up to the blank line. Signatures are in blue color by default.
Feb 21 19:21:39 <mingdao>	rkta: Recently I moved move from one computer to another, a lot of things changed.  This is my full signature https://imgur.com/hr7YpI1.png
Feb 21 19:22:54 <rkta>	mingdao: Same applies, the beginning is colored as signature, the rest not.
Feb 21 19:24:34 <rkta>	tbf, I don't like such long signatures. But your .sig is fortunately not my business. ;)
Feb 21 19:31:47 <mingdao>	PC stands for personal choice.  That is not what I usually send out, but part of 3 sigs just to show more text and how the colors change.
Feb 21 19:32:05 <mingdao>	Most people who receive my email use HTML and don't see colors.
Feb 21 19:34:23 <rkta>	I was just pointing out, that mutt does not expect empty lines in signature. I don't even say, that this is the correct behaviour.
Feb 21 19:34:36 <mingdao>	When it's received in HTML, it looks this way https://imgur.com/Lo4MBNi.png
Feb 21 19:35:00 <mingdao>	rkta: Yes, after using Mutt for 20 years...
Feb 21 19:36:47 <mingdao>	One of my sigs with no lines https://imgur.com/ZvYH78n.png
Feb 21 19:37:37 <rkta>	proves my point, it's all in blue color.
Feb 21 19:38:22 <mingdao>	rkta: So you still can't answer my question.
Feb 21 19:39:05 <mingdao>	Don't you love it when folks on IRC freely offer criticism when they don't have answers?  :^)
Feb 21 19:42:22 <rkta>	Which question? About the mutt logo? I was not even trying to answer it.
Feb 21 19:44:04 <mingdao>	I think everyone noticed; hence, what I wrote above.
Feb 21 19:45:12 <rkta>	Sometimes I just like a little chatting - and technical nitpicking is such a great topic. :-P

Feb 22 21:47:32 <absinthium>	I'm using lynx to render html emails, but the references (links at the bottom) are bsaically only opening until the first line break.
Feb 22 21:47:50 <absinthium>	That is, if the link is cut in half and I try to open it, then it only opens the first half. Is this a lynx issue or a mutt issue?
Feb 22 22:04:47 <rkta>	absinthium: not a lynx user, but if you can share such an email I can look into it. I need a precise description on how you pass the mail and how you open the links, though.
Feb 22 22:06:05 <rkta>	You could try w3m instead of lynx. If it works, it's probably a lynx issue.
Feb 23 00:00:59 <absinthium>	rkta: Forward the email to you, or screenshot the issue? How are you wanting it?
Feb 23 04:20:13 <absinthium>	rkta: It does the same with `w3m`.
Feb 23 06:39:54 <rkta>	absinthium: You can forward the mail to mail@rkta.de. If it's the same with w3m, at least we know it's a mutt issue.
Feb 23 06:58:19 <absinthium>	rkta: Sent.
Feb 23 06:58:26 <rkta>	thanks
Feb 23 06:58:35 <absinthium>	:)
Feb 23 08:25:16 <rkta>	absinthium: Your mail only has a text/plain part ;)
Feb 23 09:45:49 <absinthium>	rkta: Did it send correctly that time?
Feb 23 09:47:05 <rkta>	One moment please, I'm dealing with a customer in another channel :-P
Feb 23 09:50:12 <rkta>	absinthium: nope
Feb 23 09:51:03 <absinthium>	Hmm... how should I send it? I disabled HTML rendering on my end so it's showing as all HTML when I send it.
Feb 23 09:58:31 <rkta>	There's some options to configure how mutt deals with attachment. I usually do not forward with attachments. Do you need to forward the whole mail as attachment, maybe?
Feb 23 10:07:39 <absinthium>	Perhaps. If it helps any, it doesn't matter which email it is. As long as *any* link is in the email that is longer than the mutt terminal window is wide, then the URL is wrapped. However, when clicking this link, only the top-line of the wrapped URL is opened.
Feb 23 10:08:42 <absinthium>	https://pasteboard.co/8xnSPzuIcLjT.png
Feb 23 10:10:06 <absinthium>	Look at link [7] in "References". It's wrapped after "[...]93cGxv" and, therefore, only opens prior to the wrap.
Feb 23 10:31:22 <rkta>	Image not found...
Feb 23 10:31:34 <rkta>	What means clicking in this context?
Feb 23 10:33:18 <absinthium>	When I place my cursor atop the URL and press my left mouse button.
Feb 23 10:35:47 <rkta>	So, then it's more of a problem with your terminal emulator. Both mutt and lynx don't support mouse.
Feb 23 10:40:47 <absinthium>	I don't seem to have the issue when using `newsboat` which also renders HTML and wraps URLs, nor `weechat`. All of these run in `alacritty`.
Feb 23 10:40:48 <rkta>	When formatting the mail there's probably a \n inserted to wrap it to 80 chars. 
Feb 23 10:41:40 <absinthium>	The strange thing is that if I enter full-screen on `mutt` then the URL is stretched and then more of the URL is included when opened.
Feb 23 10:42:07 <rkta>	lynx will probably wrap to your terminal width.
Feb 23 10:42:33 <rkta>	w3m takes a -col option with -dump, dunno about lynx.
Feb 23 10:58:24 <absinthium>	I'm using `w3m` now. I've set `-cols` to various settings to see what works. I still have the same issue.
Feb 23 10:58:34 <absinthium>	`text/html; w3m -dump -cols 100 %s; nametemplate=%s.html; copiousoutput;`
Feb 23 10:58:51 <absinthium>	I'm sure I'm doing something wrong, but I'm going to head to bed now. Maybe we can figure it out tomorrow.

Feb 24 00:38:16 <absinthium>	I asked in #alacritty, and that seems to be why URLs aren't opened properly after they're wrapped.
Feb 24 00:38:42 <absinthium>	Apparently, Alacritty has no way to know that a URL is wrapped or not so it can't open the entire URL if it is, in fact, wrapped.
Feb 24 00:44:27 <absinthium>	However, `kitty` does the same. Hmm...
Feb 24 01:55:54 <mingdao>	urxvt opens wrapped URLs 
Feb 24 02:08:37 <absinthium>	According to this issue (https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5453): "It'll work on multiline URLs just fine, chances are you're running an application that doesn't wrap start to end of each line which is not supported."
Feb 24 02:08:58 <absinthium>	Maybe wrapping from start to end of each line could fix the issue.

Feb 29 11:38:06 <swimm3r>	Hello. I enabled crypt_use_gpgme but when I try to open an e-mail I get this error: [-- Error: decryption failed: No secret key --]
Feb 29 11:38:35 <swimm3r>	Can anyone help me, please?
Feb 29 11:39:42 <colo>	swimm3r: was your GPG pubkey used to encrypt the mail? i.e., can you manually decrypt the cyphertext using gpg?
Feb 29 11:42:11 <swimm3r>	yes, I can
Feb 29 11:42:41 <swimm3r>	I can not decrypt the email from another person
Feb 29 11:42:57 <swimm3r>	I can decrypt my sent mails
Feb 29 12:23:58 <swimm3r>	I don't know what to do, to make it work
Feb 29 13:44:42 <colo>	swimm3r: I mean, can you use your GPG private key to decrypt the message as sent by the sender manually? if not, are you sure they chose the proper gpg key to encrypt when sending to you?

Feb 29 17:12:03 <jindraj>	swimm3r: you're looking for `fcc_clear` or `pgp_self_encrypt` depending on your taste - see muttrc(5) for more details. Unfortunately all the previous sent e-mails will still be unreadable for you. Unless you have private keys of the recipients ;-)
Feb 29 18:48:33 <swimm3r>	jindraj: I can send encrypted email, they are received correctly, but I can't receive.
Feb 29 18:48:47 <swimm3r>	same error is received: [-- Error: decryption failed: No secret key --]

Mar 01 08:03:44 <swimm3r>	thank you jindraj and mingdao 
Mar 01 08:22:57 <swimm3r>	now is working fine (I can decrypt received mails). I had to revoke the old key, and add new one.
Mar 01 08:23:58 <swimm3r>	thanks again for the support
Mar 01 09:50:11 <mingdao>	swimm3r: Good job!
Mar 01 09:57:42 <swimm3r>	thanks to you
Mar 01 10:52:16 <raph_ael>	hi, i'm using mutt with pass for smtp password, though there are spaces in the password, and mutt doesn't get the full password, has anyone encountered this ? thanks
Mar 01 11:10:35 <rkta>	raph_ael: Simple solution: Avoid whitespace in passwords. ;) Does it work if you do not use pass?
Mar 01 11:13:00 <raph_ael>	rkta: i'd like to :) though it's gmail application password, you can't choose
Mar 01 11:13:43 <raph_ael>	it works with mbsync with pass, that is quite strange
Mar 01 11:20:47 <rkta>	raph_ael: I'm asking if it works with mutt without pass to see if mutt can handle passwords with whitespace or if it's a quoting issue.
Mar 01 11:21:44 <rkta>	I would be not suprised if google did this on purpose.
Mar 01 11:22:03 <raph_ael>	rkta: i think it's quoting, because when I launch mutt, it throws the second word of the password as unknown command
Mar 01 11:22:48 <rkta>	raph_ael: Did you see Example 3.6 in the fine manual?
Mar 01 11:23:01 <raph_ael>	rkta: also thanks for helping
Mar 01 11:23:07 <raph_ael>	rkta: i'll have a look
Mar 01 11:47:18 <raph_ael>	rkta: do you have an url, i end up on different things on different sites, sorry
Mar 01 11:49:26 <rkta>	raph_ael: You should find your local version, which matches your installed mutt version, in /usr/share/doc/mutt/html/manual.html
Mar 01 11:50:10 <rkta>	http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/#ex-backtick-dblquotes
Mar 01 11:50:18 <rkta>	raph_ael: ^
Mar 01 11:51:47 <raph_ael>	rkta: thanks again
Mar 01 11:53:12 <raph_ael>	rkta: works great, i should have thought of it

Mar 02 03:30:15 <zsw>	sarnold: I'm not 100% sure, but I'd first try changing the order of 'alternative_order text/html text/plain' so text/plain is first.  If that doesn't work, then I'd test with a /etc/mailcap file.  
Mar 02 03:31:04 <zsw>	I have vague memories of ~/.mailcap not getting read somewhere in my life, but I might have dreamt that.
Mar 02 03:33:37 <sarnold>	zsw: thanks for taking a look, let me give that a shot
Mar 02 03:39:53 <sarnold>	zsw: re-ordering to alternative_order text/plain text text/html  didn't change it -- mutt still renders the text/plain version, not the text/html version. ~/.mailcap is read immediately before spawning w3m when I request viewing the attachment manually -- and /etc/mailcap wasn't consulted at all (my guess is ~/.mailcap satisfied what mutt wanted, so it didn't go looking any further)
Mar 02 03:54:38 <zsw>	sarnold: Ah sorry I misread.  I thought you wanted text/plain to display first.  I have to go to sleep, but have you rtm, http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/#auto-view ?  Have you tested with more than just one email?  Just in case your test data is what's throwing you off.
Mar 02 03:56:38 <sarnold>	zsw: oh yes, I started with the manual :) I stood zero chance of getting here without it, hehe
Mar 02 03:56:54 <sarnold>	zsw: good hint with the email, though -- all three that I have tested with came from a single source!
Mar 02 03:57:05 <sarnold>	zsw: I'll give that a shot next. thanks for your help, good night, good weekend :)
Mar 02 04:05:59 <zsw>	I switched the order of alternative_order in my muttrc so that text/html was first and it displays an html dump
Mar 02 04:06:16 <zsw>	Here are my settings:
Mar 02 04:06:18 <zsw>	auto_view text/html text/enriched text/x-vcard application/x-zip-compressed
Mar 02 04:06:20 <zsw>	alternative_order text/html text/plain text/enriched
Mar 02 04:06:22 <zsw>	mime_lookup application/octet-stream
Mar 02 04:06:35 <zsw>	Here is what I have in /etc/mailcap:
Mar 02 04:06:43 <zsw>	text/html;                      /usr/bin/lynx -dump -force-html -nomargins '%s';        copiousoutput;              nametemplate=%s.htl;description=HTML Text
Mar 02 04:10:40 <zsw>	can you test removing this from your ~/.mailcap:
Mar 02 04:10:42 <zsw>	text/html; /usr/bin/w3m -T text/html %s; needsterminal; description=HTML Text; nametemplate=%s.html
Mar 02 04:11:08 <zsw>	just have 'text/html; /usr/bin/w3m -I %{charset} -dump -T text/html %s; copiousoutput; description=HTML Text; nametemplate=%s.html'
Mar 02 04:11:37 <zsw>	sarnold: ^
Mar 02 04:12:00 <sarnold>	zsw: sorry, I got heads-down on another task..
Mar 02 04:12:33 <sarnold>	removing the 'needsterminal' line didn't change anything :(
Mar 02 04:15:05 <sarnold>	zsw: I think I got it! I think .. I was just testing setting alternative_order either via :source /tmp/mutt.rc  and had it in there, or by typing in :alternative_order .... by hand.
Mar 02 04:15:15 <sarnold>	zsw: I already had an alternative_order line in my ~/.muttrc.
Mar 02 04:15:36 <sarnold>	zsw: and it looks a lot like I can't *change* it once it's been set. does this sound like a sane conclusion?
Mar 02 04:16:23 <sarnold>	(which would be very sad, the end goal of this thing was to set a folder-hook that would set the order to prefer text/html in one group of folders, and text/plain everywhere else)
Mar 02 04:17:52 <sarnold>	I'd also love to know if there's a way to find out what the current order actually is. because it's not a variable, the :set ?foo and :set foo=<tab> things don't work :(
Mar 02 04:21:32 <sarnold>	.. :unalternative_order *   !!
Mar 02 04:22:07 <sarnold>	I might have to unsay some of the bad things I've said about narkive in the past. todd had my answer from 21 years ago https://mutt-users.mutt.narkive.com/M9Er9CXQ/setting-alternative-order-on-a-per-message-basis#post10
Mar 02 04:22:35 <sarnold>	probably that email is *somewhere* not in narkive, but this one came to the top of google, heh
Mar 02 04:33:48 <sarnold>	zsw: thanks so much for sticking with me. Thinking to myself "I should just copy and paste what he's got into my ~/.muttrc" was the magic bit that unlocked it all.

Mar 06 09:53:14 <snoriman>	Hi! What do you use to read/parse html messages?  I normally use `lynx -dump`but somehow links are spread over multiple lines when they are very long which means I can't open. 
Mar 06 09:56:49 <ch>	cant your terminal deal with the line break in the url?
Mar 06 09:57:12 <jindraj>	snoriman: use urlview https://superuser.com/a/333866/996550
Mar 06 09:58:13 <snoriman>	jindraj: thanks!
Mar 06 09:58:23 <snoriman>	ch: no it's broken into several lines
Mar 06 09:58:25 <rkta>	Few days ago absinthium had the same problem, IIRC he got it solved somehow.
Mar 06 09:59:07 <snoriman>	rkta: what that with urlview?
Mar 06 09:59:39 <absinthium>	snoriman: I installed `urlscan` and I invoke it with Alt+u.
Mar 06 10:00:14 <absinthium>	macro index \033u |"urlscan -c -d -H -s"\n
Mar 06 10:00:16 <absinthium>	macro pager \033u |"urlscan -c -d -H -s"\n
Mar 06 10:00:46 <snoriman>	absinthium: ah thanks, urlscan is part of the base packages of Arch. Going to try that!
Mar 06 10:03:10 <snoriman>	nice, that works perfectly!
Mar 06 10:03:12 <absinthium>	Directly clicking the links doesn't work in Alacritty and kitty if they're too long and break. It did work in urxvt, but it's a really ugly terminal emulator. :P
Mar 06 10:05:21 <absinthium>	One more thing, if not done already `unset wait_key` so you'll automatically return to your message after opening a link.
Mar 06 10:08:53 <rkta>	Without wait_key you also won't see errors/output when piping a mail.
Mar 06 10:25:00 <snoriman>	thanks

Mar 09 23:51:55 <absinthium>	Is there a way to escape the command input without pressing Ctrl+c which prompts the exit of mutt?
Mar 09 23:52:37 <absinthium>	That is, the invocation of the prompt from pressing colon.

Mar 14 06:17:36 <virtualsid>	thanks jindraj. I guess that will have to do then :)
Mar 14 08:47:32 <thorsten`>	I've recently updated dovecot and now it claims my subscriptions are empty (the mutt sidebar ist empty). Do you have an idea what the issue is?
Mar 14 08:48:32 <thorsten`>	(I know that it's not a mutt question, but people here have expertise and are helpful :-) )
Mar 14 08:51:39 <thorsten`>	aah. nevermind... it turned out I had changed the hostname too (intentionally) and I was setting imap_check_subscribed depending on the hostname in my muttrc
Mar 14 08:51:47 <thorsten`>	sorry :)
