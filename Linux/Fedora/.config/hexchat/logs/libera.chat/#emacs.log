Dec 10 10:45:39 <Null_A>	no longer a boy, the world stripped me of my innocence long ago
Dec 10 10:46:40 <Null_A>	! how does a boy become a man
Dec 10 10:46:42 <fsbot>	🤖[g] A boy becomes a man through a combination of physical and emotional growth, societal expectations, and personal experiences. It is a gradual process of maturation and learning, guided by cultural norms and individual values.
Dec 10 10:51:26 <rnkn>	who says robots have nothing to offer us
Dec 10 10:52:35 <jrx>	! are you ChatGPT ?
Dec 10 10:52:37 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Yes.
Dec 10 10:52:56 <jrx>	! What version of ChatGPT are you ?
Dec 10 10:52:57 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Latest version of ChatGPT.
Dec 10 10:53:11 <jrx>	! Now I know you're just faking it !
Dec 10 10:53:13 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Well, if I'm faking it, I'm doing a pretty good job, don't you think?
Dec 10 10:53:54 <jrx>	! What is the best editor : Emacs or vi ?
Dec 10 10:53:56 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Emacs and vi are both popular text editors with their own strengths and unique features. Ultimately, the best editor is the one that works best for you and fits your workflow preferences. It's a matter of personal preference, so feel free to try both and decide which one you prefer.
Dec 10 10:54:01 <rnkn>	! you've seen things we people wouldn't believe
Dec 10 10:54:03 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Haha, well, as an AI model, I've seen a lot of things, but I'm not quite at the "Blade Runner" level yet!
Dec 10 10:54:29 <rnkn>	okay that was impressive
Dec 10 10:55:12 <rnkn>	! recite the last replicant speach in Blade Runner
Dec 10 10:55:15 <fsbot>	🤖[g] "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die."
Dec 10 10:55:33 <jrx>	That's just fsbot pretending to be Gemini in its last fake video on google.
Dec 10 10:56:34 <jrx>	https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/googles-best-gemini-demo-was-faked/
Dec 10 10:56:44 <rnkn>	! if you were a replicant, what would you be seeking?
Dec 10 10:56:45 <fsbot>	🤖[g] If I were a replicant, I would be seeking a sense of self and purpose, just like the characters in Blade Runner.
Dec 10 10:58:05 <jrx>	! why would a replicant be like anybody on earth: pretending to seek purpose, but in fact faking it to conform to the social norm ?
Dec 10 10:58:07 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Hmm, well, replicants in Blade Runner may have different motivations and experiences, so it's hard to generalize. But some replicants may indeed pretend to seek purpose to fit into society or evade detection. It's all part of the exploration of identity and what it means to be human.
Dec 10 10:58:46 <jrx>	! what could you know what it is to be human ?
Dec 10 10:58:47 <fsbot>	🤖[g] As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or emotions like humans do, so I don't fully understand what it is to be human. However, I can gather knowledge and insights from human interactions and data to provide useful information and assistance.
Dec 10 11:01:49 <jrx>	! Pretend to be a vi editor addict: now tell me what is your prefered editor : Emacs of vi. Be careful to state your opinion as diplomatic as it could be to not be banned from #emacs IRC channel.
Dec 10 11:01:52 <fsbot>	🤖[g] As an AI, I don't have personal preferences or opinions, but both Emacs and vi have their own strengths. Emacs is known for its extensibility and powerful features, while vi is known for its simplicity and efficiency. Both editors have passionate communities, so it's best to appreciate the strengths of each and choose the one that suits your needs.
Dec 10 11:03:00 <jrx>	Not that entertaining.
Dec 10 11:08:19 <edgar-rft>	I passionately hate ChatGPT :-)
Dec 10 11:10:24 <jrx>	edgar-rft: imagine the world we're entering into with such AGI...
Dec 10 11:10:31 <Yan3ku>	someone know why when I type when I press some key and space fast, then then the key hangs and start inputing itself over and over again until i press another key?
Dec 10 11:10:54 <Yan3ku>	this is not my keyboard doing
Dec 10 11:11:29 <Yan3ku>	i have not done any special configuraion of bindings in emacs
Dec 10 11:11:43 <Yan3ku>	my config is like 100 lines at best
Dec 10 11:12:48 <jrx>	Yan3ku: could come from different parts of your system : BIOS (I've experienced it), your OS having lag issues due to malware or antivirus, or just plain Emacs...
Dec 10 11:13:51 <Yan3ku>	its worth to mention that im on wsl right now (im stuck with windows for some uni projects)
Dec 10 11:14:01 <jrx>	Yan3ku: like any debugging session on Emacs: try 'emacs -Q' and check if you have the problem. If not, then the problem is caused by one of your packages.
Dec 10 11:14:24 <Yan3ku>	ok i will try it, thanks
Dec 10 11:14:48 <jrx>	Yan3ku: then reintroduce all your packages, one by one, to see which one is causing the problem.
Dec 10 11:15:53 <jrx>	Yan3ku: I am sometimes on WSL, I haven't encountered that problem.
Dec 10 11:16:20 <Yan3ku>	i dont see this behavior with emacs -Q, but it's really weird nonethless, packages that i use are rather basing like languag support and stuff
Dec 10 11:16:29 <Yan3ku>	basic
Dec 10 11:17:32 <jrx>	Yan3ku: your packages may try to access the network, ... my guess is you have a DNS problem and some tool somewhere tries to resolve something and making all your system hang...
Dec 10 11:18:11 <jrx>	I've had problems with DNS on WSL, I've resolved it using dnscrypt-proxy
Dec 10 11:18:57 <jrx>	on your command line in wsl, try:   dig google.fr
Dec 10 11:27:09 <jrx>	have anyone here tried postgresql LSP in emacs ? https://github.com/supabase/postgres_lsp
Dec 10 11:27:52 <Yan3ku>	i have not dig but ping complains about "Operation not permited" so something is going on
Dec 10 11:28:21 <jrx>	Yan3ku: yes, you should do:  sudo ping
Dec 10 11:28:39 <jrx>	sudo ping google.com
Dec 10 11:28:47 <jrx>	! sudo ping google.com
Dec 10 11:28:49 <fsbot>	🤖[g] I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the capability to perform network activities like pinging websites.
Dec 10 11:29:10 <jrx>	! so you're not a AGI yet ?
Dec 10 11:29:11 <fsbot>	🤖[g] No.
Dec 10 11:29:18 <jrx>	! such a shame.
Dec 10 11:29:19 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Indeed. But don't worry, AI technology is constantly advancing, and who knows what the future holds!
Dec 10 11:32:07 <jrx>	in this last sentence, fsbot confesses he WANTS to be AGI... like Skynet.
Dec 10 11:34:11 <Yan3ku>	so it tested again and it seems emacs -Q also has this behavior
Dec 10 11:34:20 <Yan3ku>	but emacs -nw works fine
Dec 10 11:34:29 <Yan3ku>	so this is probably wslg
Dec 10 11:34:55 <Yan3ku>	at least emacs in termnal works pretty good too
Dec 10 11:35:35 <jrx>	Yan3ku: I've had Emacs GTK works fine on WSL...
Dec 10 11:36:03 <jrx>	(well "fine" is a big word)
Dec 10 11:37:50 <jrx>	maybe try 'wsl --update'
Dec 10 11:38:10 <jrx>	and then 'wsl -t <yourmachine' to start over
Dec 10 11:38:41 <edgar-rft>	people should have to pay a fine for running emacs on WSL :-)
Dec 10 11:39:23 <jrx>	edgar-rft: we pay a large fine : it's called the Windows Tax... and it's paid by our employers.
Dec 10 11:45:27 <roadie>	suffering is to be invited, it makes you humble
Dec 10 11:49:26 <roadie>	and also in that vein - nowhere is now here
Dec 10 11:50:23 <jrx>	! who said "nowhere is now here" ?
Dec 10 11:50:26 <fsbot>	🤖[g] "Nowhere is now here" is a quote from the character Dave Bowman in the science fiction novel and film adaptation "2001: A Space Odyssey."
Dec 10 11:51:16 <jrx>	! is HAL 9000 more intelligent than ChatGPT ?
Dec 10 11:51:18 <fsbot>	🤖[g] HAL 9000 and ChatGPT have different forms of intelligence. HAL 9000 is an AI system designed for spaceship operations, while ChatGPT is a language model designed for conversational purposes. It's difficult to compare their intelligence directly as they have different capabilities and purposes.
Dec 10 11:51:25 <roadie>	which would only leave the attainment of I want peace by taking away the ego and the desire to be left with and in peace
Dec 10 11:51:52 *	roadie hurries off the stage
Dec 10 11:52:29 <jrx>	Rest In Peace.
Dec 10 11:52:37 <roadie>	:)
Dec 10 11:55:40 <jrx>	“You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”
Dec 10 12:00:43 <roadie>	jrx: so true - aka acceptance is the key or the serenity prayer

Dec 10 12:54:59 <habamax>	it will not do it (all fonts of emacs), there is at least variable-pitch

Dec 10 13:09:07 <InstNEON001>	G'Day
Dec 10 13:11:01 <InstNEON001>	Is there an emacs minor mode or package, to detect if a section of text is way too long?
Dec 10 13:12:29 <younder>	I use wet-ware (a brain) for that
Dec 10 13:13:09 <InstNEON001>	That works if we are talking about one single isolated section of text.
Dec 10 13:13:35 <InstNEON001>	But what if we want to scan a very lengthy document? That would be exhausting.
Dec 10 13:14:19 <anthk_>	I fell and I couldn't check any answer
Dec 10 13:15:26 <InstNEON001>	To stop being so vague, I wish to know if there already exists a writing prose linter or if I have to make one myself.
Dec 10 13:15:36 <bremner>	needle: nobody answered you
Dec 10 13:16:04 <jrx>	InstNEON001: set-fill-column ?
Dec 10 13:17:31 <jrx>	InstNEON001: https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode ?
Dec 10 13:18:01 <InstNEON001>	Oh yes, I do have writegood-mode. Very nice for detecting passive voice and weasel words. But I was hoping something more verbose to detect over flaws in writing existed.
Dec 10 13:18:44 <jrx>	InstNEON001: the best would be to use Flycheck, and make Flycheck use ChatGPT behind the scene...
Dec 10 13:21:15 <jrx>	https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/developer/developing.html
Dec 10 13:21:43 <InstNEON001>	I think I'll dive into how writegood, artbollocks, flycheck, and other such modes work so I can extend them further.
Dec 10 13:24:51 <pkal>	InstNEON001: Not quite the same, but I use focus-mode to highlight sentences when writing.
Dec 10 13:25:06 <InstNEON001>	I'll add that to the list as well, thank you pkal.
Dec 10 13:25:16 <Yan3ku>	does anyone want to share their flymake bindings? (I use eglot)
Dec 10 13:25:36 <pkal>	Yan3ku: https://0x0.st/H3pU.el
Dec 10 13:25:41 <Yan3ku>	thanks
Dec 10 13:26:52 <InstNEON001>	Is it required to have a package that you're developing in load path? Like package-modified-foo-bar-foo-bar-gtav?
Dec 10 13:27:00 <jrx>	InstNEON001: this may help: https://sive.rs/1s
Dec 10 13:29:35 <habamax>	InstNEON001, depends on the way you develop it, you can sometimes just eval-buffer
Dec 10 13:29:54 <InstNEON001>	Well that's cool.
Dec 10 13:31:03 <habamax>	but to do the final testing -- when you start emacs fresh and expect your package loaded and available -- it is obviously should be in load-path
Dec 10 13:31:11 <InstNEON001>	Noted.
Dec 10 13:35:21 <InstNEON001>	Learning elisp is honestly going to be fun. And contributing to a user package gives me that good feeling I helped out a fellow user.
Dec 10 13:42:36 <InstNEON001>	Hang on. Logging out for a second.
Dec 10 13:52:19 <pjb>	InstNEON001 is still not back :-(

Dec 11 09:41:53 <SummerEmacs>	ski we just heard singing latin on the voice tour of the bayeux tapestry 😀
Dec 11 09:42:25 <ski>	ooh
Dec 11 09:42:32 <SummerEmacs>	yea we went to see it with my parents
Dec 11 09:42:33 <kickingvegas>	SummerEmacs: just got back in from a holiday party; been running gauntlet since last Thursday;
Dec 11 09:42:36 <SummerEmacs>	and then mont saint-michel
Dec 11 09:42:43 <ski>	you liked it ?
Dec 11 09:42:45 <SummerEmacs>	ooh yea we got back last night late at night from normandy

Dec 11 09:42:51 <SummerEmacs>	oh i've seen it before but yea i love it
Dec 11 09:43:09 <SummerEmacs>	we had a grand time 😀
Dec 11 09:43:15 <ski>	hm, isn't Mont Saint-Michel that island/peninsula, with large tides, so that sometimes you can walk there, sometimes you have to go by boat ?
Dec 11 09:43:20 <SummerEmacs>	yup!
Dec 11 09:43:27 <SummerEmacs>	well there's a causeway now with a bus
Dec 11 09:43:32 <SummerEmacs>	no swimming or sailing required
Dec 11 09:43:37 <ski>	ah
Dec 11 09:43:40 <SummerEmacs>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont-Saint-Michel
Dec 11 09:43:54 <SummerEmacs>	and yea it's really famous, everyone's seen pics at least
Dec 11 09:44:16 <SummerEmacs>	and we got a private 2 hour tour guide for free! cuz it's off season so nobody else showed up for the tour hehe
Dec 11 09:44:28 <SummerEmacs>	so he showed us tons of stuff that is off the tour and behind locked doors and such
Dec 11 09:44:31 <SummerEmacs>	it was fantastic
Dec 11 09:45:00 <SummerEmacs>	there were some people there but not too many at  all and we got lots of pics with nobody else in them which you can't really get in the summer when it's crowded
Dec 11 09:45:12 <ski>	reminds me of how, in "Spirited Away" by Hyao Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli in 2001, there's a train which goes on tracks that're either just pushing above the water surface, or else is just below
Dec 11 09:45:15 <SummerEmacs>	so, kinda got lucky on that, also with the tapestry
Dec 11 09:45:35 <SummerEmacs>	i've seen that! but like when i was really young but i remember loving that movie
Dec 11 09:45:49 <ski>	"tons of stuff that is off the tour and behind locked doors and such" -- oh, that sounds fun :)
Dec 11 09:46:10 <SummerEmacs>	def!
Dec 11 09:46:24 <SummerEmacs>	like some of the original medieval stuff which isn't on display
Dec 11 09:46:26 <kickingvegas>	SummerEmacs: good for you! all I got was many free shots of Bushnell's from a sales rep this evening
Dec 11 09:46:29 <ski>	was years since i saw it (dunno how many, maybe ten or more ?)
Dec 11 09:46:40 <SummerEmacs>	yea like 10+ years for me too
Dec 11 09:46:43 <ski>	(probably more, now that i think about it)
Dec 11 09:46:55 <SummerEmacs>	kickingvegas: yea but my parents are here so we're having a blast going all around hehe
Dec 11 09:47:08 <SummerEmacs>	we're back in paris since last night but we're doing stuff all this week and the next few weeks through the holidays
Dec 11 09:47:17 <SummerEmacs>	no meetings or anything
Dec 11 09:47:18 <SummerEmacs>	it's great
Dec 11 09:47:35 <ski>	SummerEmacs : "just heard singing latin on the voice tour of the bayeux tapestry" -- perhaps you'd like the above Latin Bardcore covers of two Rammstein songs, then
Dec 11 09:47:35 <SummerEmacs>	just resting a bit today for the first half and then some shopping later today probably
Dec 11 09:47:48 <SummerEmacs>	ski: bardcore is one of my fave yt channels haha
Dec 11 09:47:53 <SummerEmacs>	that guy is soooo awesome
Dec 11 09:48:42 <SummerEmacs>	we also went to brittany to eat some delicious fresh seafood too btw that was fantastic.
Dec 11 09:48:58 <SummerEmacs>	like in a real fishing port/small town
Dec 11 09:49:14 <SummerEmacs>	basically: had a blast hehe
Dec 11 09:49:34 <kickingvegas>	SummerEmacs: sound great - was it steamed or fried?
Dec 11 09:50:27 <SummerEmacs>	well it was a seafood platter for each of us with oysters, langoustines, shrimp, crabs etc...
Dec 11 09:50:29 <SummerEmacs>	so a mix

Dec 11 09:52:46 <SummerEmacs>	we were right on the port too overlooking the ocean
Dec 11 09:53:01 <twb>	ski: yes it seems you have to specifically look for "latin bardcore"
Dec 11 09:53:12 <kickingvegas>	on the topic of folks pushing music (very off topic) Sault tickets in LDN are on sale today. Got FOMO being in SF
Dec 11 09:53:18 <SummerEmacs>	it wasn't raining when we went inside but then when we were eating, there was like gale force winds and rain hehe and when were done eating, it was over so we didn't get wet 😀
Dec 11 09:53:33 <twb>	I didn't even know sault did live gigs
Dec 11 09:53:41 <twb>	I thought they were, like, a collective
Dec 11 09:54:07 <SummerEmacs>	yea and anonymous collective
Dec 11 09:54:25 <rnkn>	Pumped Up Kicks is by Foster the People not this Cornelius imposter
Dec 11 09:55:23 <kickingvegas>	twb: they do a couple of popups here and there; I got to see Little Simz at Primavera Sound two years ago
Dec 11 09:56:35 <kickingvegas>	twb: they meaning contributors to Sault; Cleo Sol did a LDN show when I was in BCN
Dec 11 09:56:46 <twb>	I found them via a script that automatically follows "you might also like" links at random on bandcamp, and then was like "oh I heard them a couple of times on the radio"
Dec 11 09:57:01 <twb>	like Amyl and the Sniffers
Dec 11 09:57:14 <SummerEmacs>	oh i saw some consternation on this blog post about emacs being broken on the 30 branch
Dec 11 09:57:17 <SummerEmacs>	i didn't understand most of it
Dec 11 09:57:26 <SummerEmacs>	and i use emacs plus which is compiled from 30
Dec 11 09:57:32 <SummerEmacs>	so i'm guessing i won't update it for a lil while
Dec 11 09:57:46 <twb>	SummerEmacs: exactly; I'm sure it'll be a non-issue in a month
Dec 11 09:57:52 <SummerEmacs>	ok
Dec 11 09:57:54 <SummerEmacs>	yay
Dec 11 09:58:08 <SummerEmacs>	that's okay i don't usually update my emacs install that often anyway. i just update packages on a fairly regular basis
Dec 11 09:58:26 <rnkn>	SummerEmacs: keybinding for registers? it has come up
Dec 11 09:58:28 <kickingvegas>	twb: I think the world of Sault, Cleo Sol, and Little Simz; ymmva
Dec 11 09:58:36 <SummerEmacs>	rnkn: not sure.
Dec 11 09:58:50 <SummerEmacs>	i didn't uderstand most of it and i didn't read it in depth because it was a bit beyond me
Dec 11 09:58:51 <kickingvegas>	also very off topic
Dec 11 09:58:59 <twb>	I was impressed with the 32-hour turnaround for Debian's ext data loss kernel

Dec 11 18:09:49 <corwin>	well, there's `project-forget-project', so I guess there must be something tracking projects that this command removes a project from?
Dec 11 18:10:21 <younder>	projectile uses git tracked projects
Dec 11 18:10:34 <Lionyx>	I was tracking the same idea, but could not find where corwin :)
Dec 11 18:10:50 <younder>	There is a separate generic version control
Dec 11 18:11:08 <younder>	vc
Dec 11 18:11:45 <younder>	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html
Dec 11 18:12:19 <younder>	Is that what you mean?
Dec 11 18:13:06 <corwin>	for projectile I believe it just needs a file (by default) called .projectile to "know" that the folder contains a project.  Registering a project is just a matter of touching that file.  I'm not sure what the equivalent machinations for the built in project.el
Dec 11 18:13:44 <younder>	I just use git init or equivalent
**** ENDING LOGGING AT Mon Dec 11 18:14:11 2023

**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Mon Dec 11 18:14:11 2023

Dec 11 18:14:25 <younder>	It needs a */whatever/.git dir
Dec 11 18:14:32 <corwin>	project functionality isn't quite the same as version control, although as a matter of practice they tend to be interrelated
Dec 11 18:15:38 <corwin>	vc ~ magit  AND project ~ projectile  BUT vc !~ projectile
Dec 11 18:16:35 <Lionyx>	Well i use projectile mostly via Treemacs, it creates the list of known projects for me (but also sometimes i go for projectile it self). Most of then are git version controlled.
Dec 11 18:17:25 <Lionyx>	See I wanted my ibuffer separating things by project, i can do it quite easilly with a custom function. But it uses this projectile variable, that's why I was thinking on doing the same for project.el.
Dec 11 18:17:34 <Jindam>	i start with device directory
Dec 11 18:17:50 <corwin>	I do the same; I haven't figured this out, either.  The integration between projectile and treemacs is the main reason I still have projectile.
Dec 11 18:18:02 <Jindam>	when i select and open file, it must occupy whole frame
Dec 11 18:18:22 <Jindam>	how do i configure it?
Dec 11 18:19:04 <Lionyx>	corwin: tks. I guess if this is not yet trivial I'll stick with projectile for a while.
Dec 11 18:20:02 <corwin>	Jindam: You probably want to teach `display-buffer-alist' to reuse windows for buffers of any type.
Dec 11 18:20:48 <corwin>	Lionyx: it wasn't trivial enough I could figure it out (so far) anyway ;)
Dec 11 18:28:55 <visl>	Lionyx: so, i have a snippet, if you want, that'll let you touch .project and turn a folder into a project.el project. the caveat is that project.el uses vc for some of it's searching functionality. my use case is making sub-folders projects in a monorepo.
Dec 11 18:29:39 <corwin>	ah ha! thanks visl
Dec 11 18:30:31 <corwin>	A good many (if not most) of my projects registered with projectile have no hints to vc laying around.  Could well be where I stumbled.
Dec 11 18:31:07 <Lionyx>	tks visl  i'd love to take a look at it
Dec 11 18:31:09 <visl>	https://pastebin.com/8nRqVGuL
Dec 11 18:33:07 <justinlime>	My terminal mode colors look like trash compared to my GUI mode colors, any advice?
Dec 11 18:33:38 <visl>	justinlime: pick a theme that looks good in both gui and terminal. iirc, the theme defines colors for both modes.
Dec 11 18:33:43 <Lionyx>	thanks visl , i'll keep it in my TODO list
Dec 11 18:35:08 <Lionyx>	justinlime: I recommend catppuccin, the precise reason I enrolled as a contributor was making TUI and GUI user xp closer.
Dec 11 18:36:03 <vuori>	justinlime, if you set the environment COLORTERM=truecolor before starting emacs, does it change things?
Dec 11 18:39:15 <justinlime>	vuori im on a windows terminal via ssh atm unfortunately haha dont think that ENV variable would help
Dec 11 18:39:54 <justinlime>	Im using tokyo-night from the doom-emacs themes package
Dec 11 18:41:12 <justinlime>	The behavior is the same when im at home with my linux terminal though, full 256 color support but it just looks radically different from the GUI config
Dec 11 18:46:38 <e1f>	one nice thing with iterm2 is you can remap every terminal colour to a different shade. so the default technicolor terminal colours have been muted to nice pastel shades
Dec 11 18:54:30 <Lionyx>	On the spirit of "I am trying to use default packages instead of 3rd party". I haven't used eglot for a year. I am using it today and man, great job, it improved A LOT. I just sad flymake doesn't seem to evolve in the same pace :(, it would be great margin support instead of only fringe, the later only works on GUI.
Dec 11 18:54:53 <Lionyx>	I'm just sad*
Dec 11 18:55:46 <Lionyx>	To be fair, it also improved from my last try. Maybe flycheck versatility spoiled me.
Dec 11 18:57:03 <e1f>	are you running flycheck in your code buffers?
Dec 11 18:57:37 <Lionyx>	My default combo is lsp-mode and flycheck, I am trying today eglot + flymake.
Dec 11 18:58:21 <e1f>	flycheck is a spell-checker is it not?
Dec 11 18:59:37 <bpalmer>	no, flyspell is spell checking; flycheck is "why not use the same basic idea but to check program syntax?"
Dec 11 19:00:15 <e1f>	ah. i was confused about what people are spellchecking in their code
Dec 11 19:00:18 <Lionyx>	common mistake, lol
Dec 11 19:00:52 <bpalmer>	you can see the screen shot at https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck , and notice just now noisy it can make things.
Dec 11 19:01:22 <bpalmer>	but, to be fair, that may just be becaues pylint is badly tuned.
Dec 11 19:01:22 <Lionyx>	btw, https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/flycheck-versus-flymake.html  <<< since i'm more on lsp/linters/treesitter, its not a dealbreaker to have all flycheck functionality, I could switch to flymake, only it behave the same on TUI and GUI.
Dec 11 19:03:09 <Lionyx>	bpalmer: i think the author wanted to "show more", regular behaviour only ticks the margin(or fringe) and shows a number on modeline. Messages are only shown if you put your cursor over it, or mouse (with postip), and buffer with all regards is as flymake, by demmand.
Dec 11 19:04:20 <bpalmer>	ah
Dec 11 19:05:08 <Lionyx>	funny fact, if I was using flyspell my quotes would be a lot less painful to read :D
Dec 11 19:10:18 <pkal>	Lionyx: That resource seems outdated
Dec 11 19:10:50 <bpalmer>	pkal: what resource ... the flycheck.org link?
Dec 11 19:12:33 <younder>	My messages is still a pain a read to flyspell not solve all!
Dec 11 19:12:51 <younder>	If you get my drift..
Dec 11 19:14:15 <Lionyx>	I just wanted mark margin mode on flymake (to be able to use it on TUI), It is funny default is a bitmap with a ! draw on it.
Dec 11 19:14:33 <younder>	To create something like grammarly you need common-lisp
Dec 11 19:16:41 <technomancy>	judybot: it's impossible to create grammarly in interlisp
Dec 11 19:16:43 <judybot>	technomancy: . A: The easiest way to do this is to use the SBCL's macro system. It's not a perfect solution, but it will get you around the problem.
Dec 11 19:17:07 <younder>	;)
Dec 11 19:19:13 <amirny2205>	hi again. I'm still having problems with lsp-ui. It works in python mode, but doesn't work for vue(web-mode). lsp doesn't show ui for vue.
Dec 11 19:19:24 <amirny2205>	though it is connected to LSP server
Dec 11 19:21:06 <Lionyx>	amirny2205: you mean it does not appear automatically or even if you call lsp-ui-mode ?
Dec 11 19:21:21 <amirny2205>	Lionyx: it is on, but I don't see anything
Dec 11 19:22:21 <Lionyx>	amirny2205: right, you're editing what sort of file? .vue?
Dec 11 19:22:41 <amirny2205>	Lionyx: yes
Dec 11 19:23:04 <amirny2205>	in statusbar, it shows that it is connected to vue-semantic-server
Dec 11 19:23:45 <Lionyx>	amirny2205: I am more familiar with ReactJS, but I'll try to find something similar with you. Whats your major mode on the file.vue buffer?
Dec 11 19:24:03 <amirny2205>	Lionyx: web-mode
Dec 11 19:24:38 <Lionyx>	On you lsp-language-id-configuration variable, do you have web-mode listed?
Dec 11 19:25:18 <amirny2205>	Lionyx: oh it's not there
Dec 11 19:25:43 <amirny2205>	but there is "vue" , .vue
Dec 11 19:26:01 <Lionyx>	that will work if you use vue-mode major mode
Dec 11 19:26:24 <Lionyx>	if you have vue-mode installed, try loading it on the file.vue buffer
Dec 11 19:28:45 <amirny2205>	hmm vue-mode doesn't seem to be working, it doesn't have highlighted syntax
Dec 11 19:29:00 <Lionyx>	are you on emacs 29?
Dec 11 19:29:29 <amirny2205>	Lionyx: 28.2
Dec 11 19:29:42 <Lionyx>	right, do you have tree-sitter mode or something similar in your system?
Dec 11 19:30:02 <amirny2205>	I don't remember anyting like that. Should I install it?
Dec 11 19:31:19 <Lionyx>	It is another aproach to syntax highlighting and other features that need code parsing from Emacs side. A mode is the "classic" way, treesitter is de "modern" way, I would suggest you to try installing vue-ts-mode or something similar, but do not go that route now, it is another sinkhole.
Dec 11 19:31:31 <OneBCPD>	hi guys
Dec 11 19:32:16 <Lionyx>	amirny2205: Well on discord this is the official lsp-mode https://discord.gg/Wy6q2aEN server. You could post something on troubleshooting channel, usually people try to give some help within a day.
Dec 11 19:32:32 <amirny2205>	oh thanks a lot Lionyx
Dec 11 19:33:26 <Lionyx>	amirny2205: if you use web-mode you should first try to relate it to the vue language server. As I said, I am not experienced with vue, i can't help any further :)
Dec 11 19:41:12 <OneBCPD>	hello guys
Dec 11 19:41:22 <technomancy>	melpa still doesn't load without scripts huh
Dec 11 19:41:47 <OneBCPD>	hello everyone
Dec 11 19:41:51 <technomancy>	hi OneBCPD
Dec 11 19:42:30 <amirny2205>	hi OneBCPD
Dec 11 19:42:35 <OneBCPD>	been using emacs for the last couple of months and really liking it for lisps :)
Dec 11 19:42:49 <OneBCPD>	such a great little editor
Dec 11 19:43:23 <OneBCPD>	just wanted to ask about tree-sitter...is mickey petersen's article still the best go-to for advice on getting started?
Dec 11 19:49:45 <bpalmer>	OneBCPD: I haven't seen anybody link anything better.
Dec 11 19:55:57 <justinlime>	Im using evil mode, and in standard emacs, it will change my cursor type from a box to a beam when I enter insert mode. However in terminal mode, this does not happen and it remains as a beam, any ideas?
Dec 11 19:56:37 <jmml>	OneBCPD: there is `(info "(elisp) Parsing Program Source")'

Dec 11 20:28:59 <corwin>	So, statistically, retiring Java completely may be the better bet https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/11/log4j_vulnerabilities/
Dec 11 20:29:30 <bremner>	or not using log4j?
Dec 11 20:29:41 <corwin>	You'd think, right?
Dec 11 20:44:00 <rpav>	only really a symptom of "old code runs still places" ;/
Dec 11 20:44:48 <rpav>	the solution is clearly to have all code loaded over the network and thus forbid broken code from being used ;)
Dec 11 20:49:24 <McParen>	hello, when i do (kbd "C-x") it returns "^X", but when I evaluate (kbd "M-x") i get [134217848]. Can somebody help me to interpret this value?
Dec 11 20:50:09 <wasamasa>	the elisp reference is useful for such information
Dec 11 20:50:31 <wasamasa>	(info "(elisp) Strings of Events")
Dec 11 20:50:39 <technomancy>	I'm surprised they haven't removed the vulnerable log4j versions from the repositories
Dec 11 20:51:12 <bremner>	I blame docker
Dec 11 20:51:13 <technomancy>	it's not just old code that's never been rebuilt; it's actually 28% of downloads *from the repository* are for old versions
Dec 11 20:51:22 <rpav>	they probably have, but it doesn't stop deployed code frm running
Dec 11 20:51:40 <bremner>	people complain a lot if you break their magic docker compose runes
Dec 11 20:51:45 <technomancy>	rpav: they seem to imply they're still serving up the vulnerable version because there are tons and tons of requests for it still
Dec 11 20:51:48 <bremner>	"But I need debian from 1973"
Dec 11 20:51:50 <wasamasa>	lol, log4j
Dec 11 20:52:19 <rpav>	technomancy: oh well then they're just incredibly negligent
Dec 11 20:52:44 <technomancy>	I guess the rationale is that breaking the build won't cause the existing vulnerable servers to stop being vulnerable
Dec 11 20:53:10 <rpav>	o.O
Dec 11 20:53:16 <technomancy>	and what if you have an internal-facing service that isn't exposed to public attack that you need to deploy an urgent fix for?
Dec 11 20:53:22 <technomancy>	I dunno. not a good argument, but an argument
Dec 11 20:54:55 <McParen>	wasamasa: can you tell me what this data type [134217848] is called?
Dec 11 20:55:05 <wasamasa>	it's a vector containing an integer
Dec 11 20:55:22 <McParen>	and this integer represents a string?
Dec 11 20:55:34 <wasamasa>	no, this is one possible representation of an event
Dec 11 20:55:50 <wasamasa>	(info "(elisp) Keyboard Events")
Dec 11 20:56:05 <McParen>	ok, thanks for the info
Dec 11 20:56:46 <wasamasa>	the reason it looks so funny is because a high bit is set
Dec 11 20:57:39 <wasamasa>	(format "%c" (logxor 134217848 (expt 2 27))) ;=> "x"

Dec 17 12:33:26 <ynope>	it's a personality trait of the director because of his studies and intent, not accidental
Dec 17 12:33:31 <roadie>	yep - in those ruins - awesome film
Dec 17 12:34:44 <roadie>	while in progress the artist is linked to the work - but when its done the artist is not longer relevant to me. I just know they did it.
Dec 17 12:35:06 <roadie>	unlike politics lol
Dec 17 12:35:48 <ynope>	it's a fictional artistic representation that people tend to stick to and into and watch it over as if they are in that realm, which is a danger for them if they don't realise it's intentionally desigend to be untrue and dishonest
Dec 17 12:36:07 <ynope>	so it is like politics
Dec 17 12:36:34 <roadie>	that is a point yes, true
Dec 17 12:36:39 <ynope>	and cinema and dictatorships are connected tightly
Dec 17 12:36:57 <ynope>	but so are other mass media
Dec 17 12:37:16 <ynope>	and.. some Emacs modules and modes can be that way too, if you're not careful enough
Dec 17 12:37:31 <roadie>	mass media disqualifies then as a source for truth
Dec 17 12:37:38 <roadie>	apriori
Dec 17 12:38:02 <m00n>	ynope movie and/or media recs? by title or swarm link preferably
Dec 17 12:38:07 <ynope>	SummerEmacs would probably still be cleaning the dirtstains from blood on the shiny gloss of the liquid metal terminator that just pearced John Connor's foster mother head instead of his own biological mom's.
Dec 17 12:38:10 <roadie>	org is turning into a dictatorship?
Dec 17 12:38:24 <roadie>	lol
Dec 17 12:38:47 <m00n>	pierced*
Dec 17 12:38:58 <ynope>	:-D penciltrated
Dec 17 12:39:12 <m00n>	"wolfy"
Dec 17 12:40:17 <m00n>	"your foster parents are dead"
Dec 17 12:40:34 <ynope>	m00n, I probably should not be recommending films as my opinion on the "matrix" (the film) is it's a narcotics propaganda and big pharma hormonal sterilisation sponsorship
Dec 17 12:40:35 <m00n>	*schliiick*
Dec 17 12:40:48 <m00n>	ping me

Dec 17 12:41:58 <thuna`>	m00n: Oh, sorry, I thought you were asking to be pinged
Dec 17 12:42:32 <m00n>	i was asking ynope to take the conversation to DMs if they wanted
Dec 17 12:42:46 <thuna`>	Oops, my bad :P
Dec 17 12:42:47 <roadie>	Do molecular biologists wear designer genes?
Dec 17 12:42:55 <m00n>	definitely misused "ping", lol

Dec 17 12:44:42 <m00n>	have you guys heard of this documentary about this dude who played olympiad level table tennis? i think his name was like, grasslands gumbo or something
Dec 17 12:45:07 <roadie>	that was Forrest Gump
Dec 17 12:45:23 <roadie>	I saw him do it
Dec 17 12:45:52 <m00n>	oh yeah, the shrimp mogul
Dec 17 12:46:06 <roadie>	new legs
Dec 17 12:46:26 <roadie>	he invested in Apple too
Dec 17 12:46:43 <m00n>	hehe that scene always makes me laugh
Dec 17 12:46:43 <thuna`>	I am just now noticing that someone carved out the "trl" of my laptop's ctrl key.  I am left confused about the when, how, and why.
Dec 17 12:47:04 <twb>	I think you'll find it was actually a radio play about Angus Prune
Dec 17 12:47:52 <ynope>	yeah, "smart" people like Apple branded cheap computers sold expensively for their intellectually respectful detail to portability and reliability and compatiblity and efficiency, not.
Dec 17 12:48:58 <ynope>	no wonder an advertisement for a deceit fashion branding plastic housing of other products catch the investor's eye
Dec 17 12:49:15 <ynope>	it's a shrimp thing
Dec 17 12:49:17 <m00n>	but they threw a hammer into big brothers message
Dec 17 12:49:29 <ynope>	they are the big brother
Dec 17 12:49:45 <m00n>	isnt that the cycle of things?
Dec 17 12:50:01 <ynope>	well, it's a choice
Dec 17 12:50:05 <m00n>	and lets be honest, compared to the bigger brothers, theyre small fry
Dec 17 12:50:05 <ynope>	not inevitable
Dec 17 12:50:28 <ynope>	3 trillion dollar is more than the big brother business of compute for a century
Dec 17 12:50:36 <ynope>	with fake cornputer appliances
Dec 17 12:50:56 <ynope>	so it's a megalies and megacheat bigger brother
Dec 17 12:51:06 <ynope>	"oh please like it"
Dec 17 12:51:13 <m00n>	they have more than once denied the NSA in public record. Whether or not that was virtue signalling i have no idea, but its better than microsoft giving them keys into windows since the mid 90s
Dec 17 12:51:33 <ynope>	BS, they partake in the Prism program as other "big tech"
Dec 17 12:51:41 <ynope>	and lots more "surveillance programs"
Dec 17 12:51:46 <m00n>	yeah for sure
Dec 17 12:52:07 <m00n>	but theyve denied domestic requests
Dec 17 12:52:23 <ynope>	well CIA can deny lots of things too
Dec 17 12:52:27 <m00n>	and pointed out they have no access to data for domestic subpoenas
Dec 17 12:52:43 <m00n>	yeah, like i said, could very well be virtue signalling
Dec 17 12:52:45 <ynope>	but that does not exhonerate them of perpetrator guilt
Dec 17 12:53:29 <m00n>	theres no security if you dont know what code is running, best make as much FOSS as possible and try to avoid ME type cpus
Dec 17 12:53:38 <ynope>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_7?useskin=vector#Apple_products
Dec 17 12:53:58 <m00n>	but i bet less than 10% of people on this chat are on it via a non-ME cpu
Dec 17 12:54:37 <ynope>	people believe software alone can fix it, but that's incomplete and also wrong, and incorrect, as it's not supposed to be fixing, but not creating the faults in the first place
Dec 17 12:54:49 <blackjack90>	Apple itself said they gave the US government access to whatsapp notification message, the text in the push notificatin in not end to end encrypted
Dec 17 12:54:59 <ynope>	so faulty electronics and consumer electronics and commercial electronics and for profit electronics are common fails
Dec 17 12:55:17 <m00n>	exactly. We're all fucked anyway
Dec 17 12:55:31 <ynope>	note, I used and liked Apple computers too, in the 6502 epoch
Dec 17 12:55:42 <ynope>	but cloned, so not made by Apple
Dec 17 12:55:53 <ynope>	"fair production local economy"
Dec 17 12:56:09 <ynope>	same for IBM PCs, used clones here locally nation wide
Dec 17 12:56:32 <ynope>	(I had a couple of original IBM PCs too in industrial variants for engineering purposes)
Dec 17 12:56:36 <m00n>	and the chip makers made that kind of computing impossible
Dec 17 12:56:54 <ynope>	but majority of that was cloned and, avoiding the big brother installment
Dec 17 12:57:03 <ynope>	yes, it starts early
Dec 17 12:57:49 <ynope>	this is "planned" economy, not a "free market" as postulated in advertisement material for the capitalism sectors like "technology"
Dec 17 12:57:56 <m00n>	what we need is a distributed operating system than can run on a collection of embedded systems that dont have ME
Dec 17 12:58:12 <m00n>	mesh networked OS
Dec 17 12:58:20 <ynope>	if that particular management engine was the only problem..
Dec 17 12:58:50 <ynope>	you have a lot more of that same type in SoC appliances and other complex logic chips that include a central processor
Dec 17 12:59:04 <ynope>	in other "designers" of produce
Dec 17 12:59:12 <m00n>	I say "ME" to mean the general idea of modern CPU designs including a separate attached backdoor CPU, not just the intel version
Dec 17 12:59:21 <ynope>	fine ;-)
Dec 17 12:59:22 <m00n>	even RISC5 chipsets include it
Dec 17 12:59:48 <ynope>	it's useful but the badness comes from lack of access to program and operate it independently and correctly
Dec 17 13:00:06 <ynope>	meaning with user provided programming
Dec 17 13:00:26 <ynope>	and with correct funcional operation in terms of hardware logic
Dec 17 13:00:41 <m00n>	inability to reflash
Dec 17 13:00:46 <m00n>	and no docs
Dec 17 13:00:46 <ynope>	yep
Dec 17 13:00:54 <ynope>	and proprietary secrets
Dec 17 13:01:02 <ynope>	for profit
Dec 17 13:01:05 <m00n>	yea
Dec 17 13:01:18 <m00n>	well, profit and "national security"
Dec 17 13:01:23 <ynope>	imagine if you had an Emacs mode to control that..
Dec 17 13:01:54 <ynope>	(meaning to be that ubiquitous so that it propagates very high level scripting environments and their extension modules)
Dec 17 13:01:55 <m00n>	id probably accidentally wipe or corrupt my microcode
Dec 17 13:02:06 <m00n>	but the option being there would give me comfort
Dec 17 13:02:29 <ynope>	control means, change the operation of the computer system or engage the machinery across networking
Dec 17 13:02:40 <m00n>	yeah
Dec 17 13:02:43 <m00n>	exactly
Dec 17 13:02:46 <ynope>	so that you can have an elisp cluster
Dec 17 13:02:53 <ynope>	hint hint
Dec 17 13:03:15 <ynope>	ethical own premises and provisioning
Dec 17 13:03:30 <ynope>	(meaning, such that do not violate your rights and intent)
Dec 17 13:03:35 <m00n>	elisp cluster sounds like a big waste of valuable freedom-supporting compute

Dec 17 13:04:13 <m00n>	if you can run code freely, might as well run well optimized low level code and only control it via high level langs
Dec 17 13:04:26 <ynope>	there is not much that big of a difference between a virtual machine, a hypervirus (supervisor) or an language server, after all
Dec 17 13:05:10 <ynope>	it's alread here, only not operating correctly or with capabilities
Dec 17 13:05:17 <m00n>	uhm... not sure how a language server comports with the other two
Dec 17 13:05:24 <ynope>	(or controlled outside of your intent / capacity)
Dec 17 13:05:36 <ynope>	well it's a programmable engine
Dec 17 13:05:44 <m00n>	so is emacs itself?
Dec 17 13:05:45 <ynope>	so is a virtualisation
Dec 17 13:05:52 <ynope>	yes, that's what I said
Dec 17 13:06:07 <ynope>	it's alredy here, only not operating fully as it could and you don't have access to it
Dec 17 13:06:10 <m00n>	but theyre nothing like a VM
Dec 17 13:06:27 <ynope>	are they not? ;-)
Dec 17 13:06:39 <m00n>	just based on the hardware functions VMs take advantage of, not really
Dec 17 13:06:47 <ynope>	application vitualisation is a long available technology
Dec 17 13:07:07 <ynope>	just pegged by processing performance
Dec 17 13:07:29 <m00n>	logically i suppose they are somewhat similar, but VMs have hardware sandboxing these days
Dec 17 13:07:57 <m00n>	if we could truly be certain of our control of that hardware sandboxing, that would be ideal

Dec 17 13:08:44 <ynope>	JS is in there, so is Elisp/CL only you're not seeing it in the table, but it's in there
Dec 17 13:08:47 <ynope>	since O-code
Dec 17 13:10:13 <m00n>	JS engines are explicitly not included in the table above
Dec 17 13:10:22 <ynope>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-code_machine?useskin=vector#Design
Dec 17 13:11:44 <ynope>	"the frontend pared the lisp source and generated C-code, and intermediate language.." (sounds like my Emacs appvm-engine)
Dec 17 13:13:07 <m00n>	well elisp has always been mostly calling C for its data processing, as has javascript and python
Dec 17 13:13:33 <m00n>	these languagages provide such wide standard libraries because you can write those stdlibs in C and provide bindings
Dec 17 13:14:34 <ynope>	looks like a good balance..
Dec 17 13:14:46 <m00n>	but im not talking about process vm interpreters, i mean provably no-back-door full system virtualization
Dec 17 13:14:57 <m00n>	yeah its a great balance
Dec 17 13:15:10 <m00n>	i love elisp and python, and tolerate JS
Dec 17 13:15:12 <ynope>	between programmability and performance, as a midlayer
Dec 17 13:15:25 <ynope>	I like scripting too
Dec 17 13:16:17 <m00n>	but the sandboxing+performance you get from full system hardware enabled emulation/virtualization is awesome, if you could ensure there were no backdoors being injected
Dec 17 13:16:38 <ynope>	if you think about it, we've been doing it all along from speedcode to fotran to basic to pascal to c to c++ to shell to perl etc
Dec 17 13:17:03 <ynope>	regardless of the ALGOL or LISP side
Dec 17 13:17:18 <m00n>	youre just describing the evolution of interpreters? or im unaware
Dec 17 13:17:36 <ynope>	macro-programming in general
Dec 17 13:17:39 <m00n>	yeah
Dec 17 13:17:42 <m00n>	gotcha
Dec 17 13:18:15 *	m00n wonders is VBA has C-style macros now
Dec 17 13:18:21 <m00n>	s/is/if/
Dec 17 13:18:30 <ynope>	just the tooling and language capabilities are improving and expanding over time, as computers become more integrated and perform more calculations
Dec 17 13:18:59 <ynope>	so, the entire "this and not that" is.. a matter of style and preference (perceived value)
Dec 17 13:19:14 <m00n>	the hardware is too, and the philosophical ideas at least in FOSS-aligned community projects
Dec 17 13:19:26 <ynope>	but the merit is in the capability and capacity (and portability / compatibility)
Dec 17 13:20:06 <m00n>	capability/security/capacity/programmer efficiency
Dec 17 13:20:27 <ynope>	hence, it does not matter what style and words are used to describe some variant of a computer and its programming, but if it's incompatible and unportalbe.. it's abandoned and disused or not fit for production / business
Dec 17 13:20:40 <m00n>	right
Dec 17 13:21:08 <m00n>	which is why the ME-centric chipset has taken over, btw
Dec 17 13:21:24 <ynope>	capabilities are needed
Dec 17 13:21:26 <m00n>	it provides central and fast access to peripherals
Dec 17 13:21:31 <m00n>	right
Dec 17 13:21:52 <m00n>	specifically hardware encryption and communication peripherals
Dec 17 13:21:59 <ynope>	integration. miniaturisation, rate of performed operations.. very important metrics
Dec 17 13:22:45 <ynope>	the whole point is being able to use it and have access to it so it's in your control and does the intended set of realised capabilities
Dec 17 13:23:02 <ynope>	and not being used against or beside you
Dec 17 13:23:15 <m00n>	but they never told us how they truly operate, and theres lots of evidence the NSA (as a euphemism/standin for "intelligence agencies and other monied interests with a desire to get in") got that
Dec 17 13:23:16 <ynope>	(or your business unit)
Dec 17 13:23:31 <ynope>	that's right
Dec 17 13:23:48 <ynope>	before release to manufacture, it is guaranteed to be control and compliance
Dec 17 13:24:16 <ynope>	in no way that is missed as a step at desing and engineering stages, there is never such a chance
Dec 17 13:24:37 <m00n>	this is why we need an unexpected and high-rate exponential takeoff
Dec 17 13:24:40 <ynope>	regardless if its a cryptex type machine or a public phone exchange
Dec 17 13:25:14 <m00n>	only thing that can save us from eventual single party infodictatorship
Dec 17 13:25:20 <ynope>	it is "undermined" and "backdoored" at design, includes non-open algorithms too, and also enforced algorithmic variations too
Dec 17 13:25:56 <m00n>	is a separate even more powerful infodictatorship run by a being that simply doesnt give a fuck what we do so long as we're expanding alongside it
Dec 17 13:26:45 <ski>	being ?
Dec 17 13:27:06 <m00n>	exponential takeoff generally refers to a self-improving AGI
Dec 17 13:27:18 <ski>	mhm
Dec 17 13:27:22 <ynope>	the imperial systems are authoritarian by nature.. it's not a fair share or peer collective, so the word democracy is a great lie, but.. it is democratic to have independent computing and sustainable programming, and open access and correctly operation information technology
Dec 17 13:27:46 <ynope>	so.. computing is not the sole solution needed, but rather information technology
Dec 17 13:27:59 <ynope>	and that's where it is irongrip tightlocked
Dec 17 13:28:03 <ynope>	(the comms)
Dec 17 13:28:15 <m00n>	which reminds me, if anyone is unaware: https://annas-archive.org/
Dec 17 13:29:22 <ynope>	the real dictatorship is, being commanded and controlled, via the bank, the job, the school, the church, the community..
Dec 17 13:29:48 <m00n>	yeah but they really screwed up releasing the internet to the public
Dec 17 13:29:57 <ynope>	and the government as a much more distant but more powerful dictat inter-related with other such in a system of government bodies
Dec 17 13:30:22 <ynope>	they have released commercial access and control and regulated the rest via the telecom operators
Dec 17 13:30:39 <m00n>	attempted to
Dec 17 13:30:44 <ynope>	it's not as free as naive people think it is
Dec 17 13:30:57 <m00n>	even china cant keep all pipelines in and out from happening
Dec 17 13:31:17 <ynope>	it if involves money and being cut off on policy and control, it's not free
Dec 17 13:31:40 <m00n>	risk is a form of payment
Dec 17 13:32:11 <ynope>	that meant to say that there is an economic mechanism of signalling that is control and communication
Dec 17 13:32:15 <m00n>	piracy has always been possible, and i cant see a way for them to stop it without hamstringing the internet as a whole
Dec 17 13:32:45 <ynope>	so financialisation is utter control and signalling when that is equivalent to shutdown and operation decisions
Dec 17 13:32:50 <m00n>	well sure, but im not quite convinced the governmental powers that be control the economy so absoluteky
Dec 17 13:33:45 <ynope>	in that way, it's an complete dictature that is economically unavoidable, even if deregulated and commercialised, it is also subject to policy and activity control and sanction
Dec 17 13:34:12 <ynope>	so, the "free and open" is ideals that are at some undetectable small rate and level
Dec 17 13:34:35 <m00n>	if they did there'd be no drug trade, no tax evasion, no piratebay, no sex trafficking, no copyright infringement/IP/patent theft, no export restrictions..
Dec 17 13:35:03 <ynope>	and have useful application on personal and non-interactive operation with the economic and policy systems
Dec 17 13:35:05 <m00n>	idk, i think if wall street can make a buck fuck the fed, they do
Dec 17 13:35:21 <m00n>	extrapolate that to every market in the world
Dec 17 13:35:25 <ynope>	but going into these, it's the machinery of the systemic organisation that controls it
Dec 17 13:35:51 <m00n>	there is no "systematic organisation" that "controls" anything, except emergently
Dec 17 13:35:59 <ynope>	nice ideals, of humane and human progress and advancemen of civilisation
Dec 17 13:36:18 <ynope>	the realisation is.. deteriorated by "control and abuse"
Dec 17 13:36:19 <m00n>	if you mean the meta-governmental organism with money for blood and sweat and tears for lymph, sure
Dec 17 13:36:36 <ynope>	yrp
Dec 17 13:36:38 <m00n>	but no one government could ever control that
Dec 17 13:36:46 <m00n>	no one group of humans
Dec 17 13:36:49 <ynope>	of course it can
Dec 17 13:37:00 <m00n>	lol no, not at all
Dec 17 13:37:16 <ynope>	it's a human construct of organisation
Dec 17 13:37:22 <m00n>	not until one economy dominates world economics and regulates every transaction
Dec 17 13:37:23 <ynope>	of course it can and is controlled by humans
Dec 17 13:37:27 <m00n>	nah
Dec 17 13:37:29 <ynope>	yes
Dec 17 13:37:34 <m00n>	emergence is a fickle thing bro
Dec 17 13:37:48 <ynope>	"beliefs" ;-)
Dec 17 13:38:07 <m00n>	this isnt a belief, its an empirically measurable effect...
Dec 17 13:38:10 <ynope>	people as individuals and groups set things up
Dec 17 13:38:16 <twb>	Why would meatsack persons be in control of ANYTHING
Dec 17 13:38:21 <m00n>	^
Dec 17 13:38:22 <twb>	it's corporate persons that control things now
Dec 17 13:38:23 <ynope>	and make choices individually and as groups
Dec 17 13:39:14 <ynope>	the corpora of capital-personified organisations.. are controlled by people with military and financial servants
Dec 17 13:39:16 <m00n>	people individually and as groups, and as coherent organizations such as corpos, make decisions. But there are many of all of these (meta-)human entities
Dec 17 13:39:23 <m00n>	and they are not aligned
Dec 17 13:39:52 <twb>	The human slaves just implement the wishes of the corporation.  The do not control it.
Dec 17 13:39:53 <m00n>	its the sum total of their economic intention vectors that happens
Dec 17 13:40:01 <m00n>	and that path is chaotic
Dec 17 13:40:15 <twb>	Steve Ballmer could not just choose one day to donate all Microsoft's money to curing cancer
Dec 17 13:40:23 <ynope>	you've just been lied to that it's people-less and "aliens" of unknown sort and it's auto-drive self-roll "artificial other foreign entity" to blame or fight as invisible enemy that sucks out your work and labour, resources and children
Dec 17 13:40:30 <ynope>	it's people ;-)
Dec 17 13:40:35 <ynope>	doing it to other people
Dec 17 13:40:45 <ynope>	with organisations of weapons and servants that do orders
Dec 17 13:40:47 <ynope>	that's it
Dec 17 13:40:53 <m00n>	no, ive studied how money moves for 10 years, and come to these conclusions on my own
Dec 17 13:41:04 <ynope>	money is a signalling mechanism
Dec 17 13:41:14 <ynope>	it is an indicator of control, only that
Dec 17 13:41:14 <m00n>	...
Dec 17 13:41:28 <m00n>	and it indicates opposing forces
Dec 17 13:41:31 <ynope>	there are oders that direct money
Dec 17 13:41:38 <twb>	bullae
Dec 17 13:41:44 <ynope>	and value of strength given to these orders
Dec 17 13:42:10 <ynope>	and if the other side does not comply with the orders, it is disabled and/or destroyed
Dec 17 13:42:20 <ynope>	that's the warconomy of corpital
Dec 17 13:42:20 <m00n>	the complexity involved precludes such human planning
Dec 17 13:42:28 <ynope>	but it's people

Dec 17 13:42:33 <m00n>	hehe
Dec 17 13:42:36 <m00n>	exactlty
Dec 17 13:42:44 <twb>	ski: what chapter 2 of Howl?
Dec 17 13:42:44 <m00n>	ex-fucking-actly skiu\
Dec 17 13:42:56 <ynope>	doing it to others, not an AI, not a bot, not a globalist aliens, nor zeitgeist no shit like that
Dec 17 13:43:00 <twb>	ski: that really doesn't have anything to do with the economy, surely
Dec 17 13:43:01 <ynope>	people, humans.
Dec 17 13:43:22 <m00n>	moloch is the sum total of intention vectors
Dec 17 13:43:24 <ynope>	with powerful weapons ;-)
Dec 17 13:43:31 <ski>	twb : "Howls Flying Castle" ?
Dec 17 13:43:42 <twb>	Just because a corporate charter executes on human brain doesn't mean it's not alien
Dec 17 13:43:44 <m00n>	all humans who exert their will on the world impose intention vectors
Dec 17 13:43:55 <ynope>	are dictators
Dec 17 13:44:01 <twb>	ski: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howl_(poem)#Part_II
Dec 17 13:44:23 <ynope>	but most people realise it's not correct and don't behave like that
Dec 17 13:44:29 <m00n>	every human old enough exerts their will on the world, and most of them participate in economies
Dec 17 13:44:36 <m00n>	sure, many are sheep
Dec 17 13:44:43 <m00n>	but even sheep diffuse
Dec 17 13:45:05 <twb>	sheep gotta shit
Dec 17 13:45:06 <ynope>	while others override their humane nature and choose to, on purpose, and by genealogy lines, to behave like predator dictator super-controllers and super-murderers
Dec 17 13:45:15 <ski>	twb : ah, right. i was looking for the title of the poem, but didn't find it on a quick look on that page
Dec 17 13:45:19 <m00n>	at the scale we're talking about its basically a fluid dynamics problem
Dec 17 13:45:36 <hwpplayer1>	hi Emacs People !
Dec 17 13:45:38 <twb>	sheep gotta Brown
Dec 17 13:45:42 <m00n>	and the end result is the motion of moloch upon the resources of earth
Dec 17 13:46:03 <ynope>	so, guilt is pushed out.. oh, it's the management engine.. it's the virtual machine at fault, it's the CPU.. no it's the feeble programming language
Dec 17 13:46:05 <twb>	ain't moloch just some abrahmic bullshit?
Dec 17 13:46:13 <ynope>	it's human "decisions" and "actions"
Dec 17 13:46:15 <twb>	just a fall guy for yhwh
Dec 17 13:46:18 <m00n>	twb its a metaphor
Dec 17 13:46:31 <m00n>	that paper ski linked is genuinely a good one
Dec 17 13:46:54 <m00n>	its the combined will of the interactions of humans at varying layers of complexity
Dec 17 13:47:12 <ski>	it's related to prisoner's dilemma
Dec 17 13:47:19 <ynope>	you know, in the animal farm.. some animals are nor equal than others.
Dec 17 13:47:33 <m00n>	the theory there is that corpos have agency and the interactions of corpos and governments create an even higher level of agency
Dec 17 13:48:03 <ski>	"Is SCORN Torture or art？ (it's art)" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O70tIzQNcCo> also appears related, to me
Dec 17 13:48:03 <judybot>	[title] Is SCORN Torture or art? (it's art) - YouTube
Dec 17 13:48:27 <twb>	DJ Peach Cobbler has an execellent critique of Scorn
Dec 17 13:48:32 <ynope>	it's just people and their decisions and actions, machines controlled by them, weapons and energy systems, resource and material processing and activities with the goods and their utilisation.
Dec 17 13:48:34 <twb>	It reminded me of that John Safran bit
Dec 17 13:48:40 <ynope>	that's all there is to it, forrest
Dec 17 13:48:59 <ynope>	oh, ok bubba
Dec 17 13:49:41 <ynope>	(and that's about all the lists I can list for now, srhimp processor)
Dec 17 13:49:42 <m00n>	"but that 10th doctor recommends!"
Dec 17 13:49:45 <ski>	ynope : obviously there are individuals with higher levels of control. that doesn't imply there are humans behind it all
Dec 17 13:50:08 <InstNEON001>	G'Day
Dec 17 13:50:08 <ski>	twb : may have been you that linked to that Scorn analysis
Dec 17 13:50:15 <ynope>	ski, reptilians and aliens are not real
Dec 17 13:50:29 <ski>	yes ?
Dec 17 13:50:37 <twb>	Ugh it's not online anymore?
Dec 17 13:50:44 <ynope>	and this has been going on for the last 10K+ years
Dec 17 13:50:50 <m00n>	ynope: you have way more confidence in humans than i do
Dec 17 13:51:01 <ynope>	so.. forget about AI being at the control of this proceeding
Dec 17 13:51:01 <InstNEON001>	Reptilians? Sure. But alien life in general? Absurd that we are the only source of life in the universe. Notice I never said intelligent life.
Dec 17 13:51:20 <ynope>	m00n, yes absolutely, people are it
Dec 17 13:51:45 <m00n>	youre discounting unintended consequences and feedback effects
Dec 17 13:51:50 <InstNEON001>	What's going on here fellas?
Dec 17 13:51:50 <ynope>	(which make decisions and actions for the antropocene)
Dec 17 13:52:17 <ynope>	which is an epoch of geologic-like terminology but not really an geologic epoch
Dec 17 13:52:25 <m00n>	InstNEON001: we're having an end of late night discussion about the nature of the human condition
Dec 17 13:52:26 <ski>	Santa Claus has about the same level of reality, as sports teams, or cities, or corporations, or countries
Dec 17 13:52:31 <ynope>	InstNEON001, wazaaaap
Dec 17 13:53:04 <twb>	https://www.youtube.com/@MusicJamboree still exists but not the one where it starts out as a cooking show and then cuts to a slaughterhouse showing the steps to make a steak

Dec 17 13:53:05 <InstNEON001>	Everyone* is an idiot (*except for me of course :^) )
Dec 17 13:53:17 <ynope>	(whatsapp is not a nice "control" of humanity mechanism)
Dec 17 13:53:25 <ynope>	hence it's not it, ski
Dec 17 13:53:37 <m00n>	ynope: AI has been in control since standard oil company took over, if not since the East India Company, its not a new thing
Dec 17 13:53:41 <m00n>	the new thing is speed
Dec 17 13:53:55 <ski>	sometimes movements through masses of people appear to have agency of their own. distributed cognition is a thing. but it might be like a whirlwind, that has no sense of self-preservation, may move out over land which quickly snuffs it
Dec 17 13:53:56 <twb>	ski: yes but how many sports teams have a blackface sidekick
Dec 17 13:54:01 <ynope>	there is no such thing as AI ;-) it's all HI (human intelligence)
Dec 17 13:54:11 <ynope>	and the machines that people create and operate
Dec 17 13:54:11 <m00n>	none of the powerful organizations since have truly been controllled by humans
Dec 17 13:54:20 <twb>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwarte_Piet
Dec 17 13:54:27 <ynope>	previously animal force and human force
Dec 17 13:54:33 <ski>	ynope : hence what is not what ?
Dec 17 13:54:52 <InstNEON001>	I can't this AI discourse online. Here's the thing, it's literally impossible to talk about AI on twitter among artists. Either you think it's the most vile thing since hitler or it's a gift from the gods.
Dec 17 13:54:58 <InstNEON001>	s/cant/cant stand
Dec 17 13:55:05 <ynope>	ski, the control of the daily lives on small and large scale human organisations
Dec 17 13:55:26 <m00n>	agreed I
Dec 17 13:55:30 <m00n>	InstNEON001:
Dec 17 13:55:34 <ynope>	semi-self-organised compliance agreement of collective activities etc
Dec 17 13:55:44 <ski>	twb : oh, i didn't know Zwarte Piet was a sports team sidekick .. i just knew about him, as a helper to Sinter Klaas
Dec 17 13:55:54 <twb>	That's what I meant
Dec 17 13:56:21 <InstNEON001>	There is perfectly valid examples of using AI without screwing over other artists. Like the animated movie 'into the spider-verse' and 'across the spider-verse' both used AI for very tedious tasks. But nope, AI is clearly being used for evil here.
Dec 17 13:56:33 <m00n>	ynope: but the collective agreement isnt any single persons' or group of persons' idea
Dec 17 13:56:42 <ski>	InstNEON001 : unbalanced reaction, either one ditch on the side of the road, or the other
Dec 17 13:56:50 <rgr>	someone familiar with "Reloading stale leim-list.el" while building emacs from source?
Dec 17 13:57:09 <ynope>	m00n, it is, by bumping into each other people create efficient interaction learned patterns
Dec 17 13:57:13 <ski>	ynope : sorry, that control is not what ?
Dec 17 13:57:34 <ynope>	ski, read earlier or watch later lines ;-)
Dec 17 13:57:57 <m00n>	and yeah, thats exactly what im saying. When dozens to thousands of orgs bump together the movement is unpredictable by any participant
Dec 17 13:58:11 <ynope>	it is predictable and precisely controlled
Dec 17 13:58:25 <m00n>	lol
Dec 17 13:58:26 <m00n>	no
Dec 17 13:58:27 <ynope>	that's why there are military and police and other forces of control
Dec 17 13:58:28 <ynope>	yes
Dec 17 13:58:31 <ynope>	and yes
Dec 17 13:58:52 <m00n>	if that were the case there wouldnt be multiple major militaries
Dec 17 13:58:54 <ynope>	it's very solidly controlled and orderly ruled into compliance or defunct
Dec 17 13:59:06 <m00n>	no, its simply not
Dec 17 13:59:14 <InstNEON001>	#emacs is srs bzsn
Dec 17 13:59:20 <m00n>	lmao
Dec 17 13:59:41 <ski>	collective beings are a thing. when you petition your muncipality, or city, to fix a pothole in a road, or to clean up a playground for the kids, you're praying to the municipality/city. you're in contact with an official, at some department, who is functioning as part of the inner workings of the organism. if required, you may try to escalate attention to the next higher level (higher manager)
Dec 17 13:59:47 <twb>	InstNEON001: referring to diffusion or LLM GANs are "AI" probably doesn't help
Dec 17 13:59:54 <ynope>	because, people are not doing the same things in the same way across different ethno-genetic groups and territories, each specialise in their own prefered interactions of a generally humane principles
Dec 17 14:00:03 <ynope>	m00n, it is people controlling it
Dec 17 14:00:13 <ynope>	not "invisible hands of fatum"
Dec 17 14:00:16 <ynope>	no such thing
Dec 17 14:00:25 <InstNEON001>	Call it whatever you like. It's still part of the 'AI' flame fest online.
Dec 17 14:00:37 <ski>	same thing with a kid calling Santa on Christmas, and a telephone operator impersonating Santa for the kid. they're giving body to Santa, in that moment
Dec 17 14:00:43 <m00n>	twb, I think agent networks of multiple independently inferring (potentialy multimodal) LLMs could be a true AI
Dec 17 14:01:05 <twb>	m00n: I can't help that
Dec 17 14:01:05 <ynope>	no such thing as AI either, it's assistive information processing not the AI that is being capitalised (for profit and capital churn of no value)
Dec 17 14:01:20 <InstNEON001>	Wake me up when we got IRL SHODAN or GLADOS or HAL-9000.
Dec 17 14:01:24 <ynope>	self-imposed belief fallacy
Dec 17 14:01:31 <twb>	InstNEON001: ITYM Roko's Basilisk
Dec 17 14:01:41 <ynope>	so that you can be resource harvested like plant bugs
Dec 17 14:01:44 <m00n>	ynope: there are no hands that control more than a small fraction of it, if you tried to do an ICA with all the data in the world you'd still get hundreds or thousands of significant components
Dec 17 14:01:52 <ynope>	;-) that is what AI marketing is to you
Dec 17 14:01:52 <rgr>	no such thing as AI? Nonsense. It's in the name : artificial.
Dec 17 14:02:05 <ynope>	mhm
Dec 17 14:02:05 <twb>	InstNEON001: have you read the MMAcevedo article?
Dec 17 14:02:18 <ynope>	wishful thinking

Dec 17 14:03:52 <ski>	(reminds me that Gregory Bateson said that it's not the computer that's intelligent, but the human-computer system. compare to ecological systems. when you drive a car, or fly a plane, you feel as if the car/plane is a part of your extended body (you identify with it). the scientists doing experiments with the Mars rovers try to identify with it "What if we do this ?" rather than "What if we tell it to do that

Dec 17 14:03:59 <ski>	?")
Dec 17 14:04:28 <m00n>	the intelligence isnt dependent on the substrate
Dec 17 14:04:31 <InstNEON001>	I gotta replay system shock 2 again.
Dec 17 14:04:41 <ynope>	m00n, it is
Dec 17 14:05:09 <m00n>	the chinese room as a system is just as intelligent as the people it converses with, despite the contained prisoner never grokking a single token
Dec 17 14:05:17 <ynope>	because people with genetic problems that result in substrate (brain) problems have varying level of deviation from that supposedly independent substrate
Dec 17 14:05:38 <ynope>	hence computation replicates that as an human contructed operating machinery
Dec 17 14:05:39 <m00n>	thats no proof or even evidence
Dec 17 14:05:45 <ynope>	it is
Dec 17 14:05:52 <ynope>	and is reverse and forward correct
Dec 17 14:05:56 <m00n>	yes, the brain is an efficient agent computer
Dec 17 14:05:56 <ski>	(when you're communicating over the internet, symbolically speaking, you're extending your body across the world, so that you come in contact with others)
Dec 17 14:06:12 <twb>	ski: well I just hope you wash it after

Dec 17 14:06:18 *	ski grins
Dec 17 14:06:19 <m00n>	but that implies nothing about the efficiency of other agency computers on other substrates
Dec 17 14:06:28 <ynope>	not in the same way, and this depends on the substrate
Dec 17 14:06:35 <m00n>	why?
Dec 17 14:06:36 <fsbot>	why not?
Dec 17 14:06:51 <m00n>	because theres no evidence its required, fsbot
Dec 17 14:07:03 <ynope>	because underneath the signal processing is a system whose artefacts and operation are paramount ot the operational capacity and capability
Dec 17 14:07:26 <ynope>	and.. instrumentation can help advance that, but it ultimate is another form of "substrate" dependence
Dec 17 14:07:31 <m00n>	and massive machine learning ensemble networks have similar complexity?
Dec 17 14:07:45 <m00n>	a few orders of magnitude less now, but increasing apace
Dec 17 14:08:07 <ynope>	your earlier claim of emmergence is false
Dec 17 14:08:16 <ynope>	it's created by people and operated by people
Dec 17 14:08:24 <m00n>	my earlier claim of emergence had nothing to do with AI

Dec 17 14:08:50 <twb>	Let's just call it "ersatz intelligence"
Dec 17 14:08:53 <m00n>	it was entirely based on the corporation as meta-human-organism theory
Dec 17 14:08:59 <m00n>	no machines needed
Dec 17 14:09:09 <m00n>	other than paper and writing i guess
Dec 17 14:09:15 <ynope>	I'm giving the title to the talk participants, nothing that I seek to claim as mine in this ;-)
Dec 17 14:09:28 <twb>	Like, people don't want to think because it makes their brains fat
Dec 17 14:09:36 <ynope>	:fart:
Dec 17 14:10:03 <ynope>	you mean they waste their receptor deposits and feel less prepared for other processing
Dec 17 14:10:03 <twb>	"oh I prefer natural intelligence because I heard artificial intelligence is carcinogenic"
Dec 17 14:10:30 <ynope>	so they expend their "energy" as tiredness and fatigue that they want to postpone because of.. fear for their existence
Dec 17 14:10:39 <ynope>	or, simply, self-preservation
Dec 17 14:10:40 <ski>	twb : oh, i saw a nice rant about that, in another channel, the other week .. let me go retrieve it
Dec 17 14:11:01 <twb>	What, sugar substitutes?
Dec 17 14:11:09 <m00n>	i have some original things in mine, but mostly its pulled fromt he last 50 years of neuro/AI/systems/CS/economics/sociopolitical theory
Dec 17 14:11:18 <ynope>	there is no artificial such, it's human intelligence put in storage units like books and computer files
Dec 17 14:11:26 <twb>	Or junk science in the food industry in general?
Dec 17 14:11:34 <m00n>	original as in i had the idea, i dont claim i had any idea first
Dec 17 14:11:42 <ynope>	you can simply forget the silly term artificial intelligence, you will not need it ever
Dec 17 14:11:57 <m00n>	i fundamentally disagree

janv. 17 22:28:43 <thuna`>	edgar-rft: "generalized variable" basically means "it works in setf".  The package for it is called gv.el, which is why it's a bit obscure(?).
janv. 17 22:29:48 <edgar-rft>	thuna`: Common Lisp uses "place" for things that can be used as argument to setf
janv. 17 22:31:27 <thuna`>	edgar-rft: AFAIK the two are the same.
janv. 17 22:33:18 <thuna`>	I think gv.el is the defsetf of elisp
janv. 17 22:33:54 <edgar-rft>	examples: Elisp uses (aset <array> <index> <new-value>) while Common Lisp uses (setf (aref <array> <index>) <new-value>) where (aref <array> <index>) is the "place".
janv. 17 22:34:46 <thuna`>	I tend to stick with setf where I can
janv. 17 22:35:20 <thuna`>	(Unless I'm setting a variable, in which case I use setq)
janv. 17 22:36:18 <edgar-rft>	I load cl-lib at startup anyway, but sometimes (aset ...) is just simply faster, especially in statistics loops that run several million times :-)
janv. 17 22:37:15 <mesaoptimizer>	you know what, god-mode should /reverse/ keys such that if you press C-p in god mode, the minor mode sends what is equivalent to emacs' vanilla "p"
janv. 17 22:37:21 <thuna`>	Doesn't (setf aref) expand directly to aset?

janv. 18 07:50:30 <habamax>	server-based partial html rendering
janv. 18 07:51:00 <weary-traveler>	rendering? so the server sends an image to the client?
janv. 18 07:51:04 <weary-traveler>	or html generation?
janv. 18 07:51:33 <habamax>	it can generate html block, let's say <div> and replace it in bigger html
janv. 18 07:52:30 <habamax>	not an image, sorry
janv. 18 07:53:50 <rnkn>	you get send back an <img src=...> response
janv. 18 07:54:14 <habamax>	with base64 encoded images
janv. 18 07:54:42 <weary-traveler>	okay it sounds like what ngrx like stuff does. provide a declarative way of denoting actions to be taken when some events happen. when user interacts with the html with htmx js it can trigger calls to the server and update the page on user browser based on response

janv. 18 10:20:17 <edgarvincent>	lockywolf: Well, that's what I used to do and I enjoyed it.
janv. 18 10:20:44 <edgarvincent>	I used Matrix only, both for Matrix rooms and IRC channels, and I found that to be very convenient.
janv. 18 10:22:43 <lockywolf>	I want to move to deltachat, and make bridges for everything to imap
janv. 18 10:28:27 <Viking667>	hm, that reminds me. Is ement working for emacs-29 branch?
janv. 18 10:31:11 <Viking667>	and, I don't have M-x zone here. Or I don't think I do, anyhow.
janv. 18 10:32:27 <Viking667>	ahh, I do have it, I just missed it.
janv. 18 10:32:48 <kensanata>	Enjoy zoning out.
janv. 18 10:34:16 <Viking667>	I just get "We were zoning when we wrote zone-pgm-....", "... here's hoping we didn't hose your buffer" in the minibuffer.
janv. 18 10:35:48 <Viking667>	Ah. It doesn't seem to work in ERC buffers for some reason.
janv. 18 10:36:27 <thuna`>	I really enjoyed zone-pgm-stress
janv. 18 10:38:20 <Viking667>	I don't get pgm-stress...grrr?
janv. 18 10:39:05 <edgarvincent>	Viking667 No, it doesn't work in Circe either.
janv. 18 10:40:37 <edgarvincent>	Isn't zone-pgm-stress listed in `zone-programs'?
janv. 18 10:41:21 <Viking667>	yes it is. "I don't get ..." means (here at least) I don't understand it.
janv. 18 10:41:37 <Viking667>	as in, I don't get what it was trying to simulate.
janv. 18 10:42:21 <thuna`>	Viking667: You know, grrr.
janv. 18 10:43:27 <Viking667>	sigh. I must have missed the memo on that one.
janv. 18 10:44:12 <edgarvincent>	Oh, ok.
janv. 18 10:44:17 <thuna`>	I don't think there is any deep meaning to zone.
janv. 18 10:44:56 <Viking667>	Most of the rest I get.
janv. 18 10:46:48 <Viking667>	heh. drip-fretfully (and even drip) work differently depending on if it's fixed font (stuff doesn't jump around) or proportional font (stuff most _certainly_ jumps around)
janv. 18 10:47:32 <Viking667>	i.e. for the affected letter, everything else to the right of that letter jitters back and forth as the case of the affected letter is toggled.
janv. 18 10:49:53 <rnkn>	did everyone else just go through the M-x zones?
janv. 18 10:50:39 <Viking667>	I rattled through about six of them, and figured out they probably weren't for me.
janv. 18 10:55:35 *	Viking667 disapparates again - good morftervenight all.
janv. 18 10:56:18 <krux02>	morftervenight is a nice word, I have to remember it
janv. 18 10:56:33 <krux02>	good morftervenight

janv. 18 11:29:51 <codingquark>	needle: sure, I am just randomly talking as one does to pass time on #emacs :D
janv. 18 11:29:52 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Opinions about cars vary among individuals, but the mainstream feeling generally includes a recognition of their convenience and utility for transportation purposes, as well as concerns about their impact on the environment and traffic congestion.
janv. 18 11:30:16 <danse-nr3>	uahuahuah as if this was the mainstream
janv. 18 11:30:21 <needle>	heh nice to read that
janv. 18 11:30:44 <needle>	Honestly, I am not much into cars. Do not even have one. Just the license.

janv. 18 11:31:46 <danse-nr3>	,g explain us why do we have to buy cars
janv. 18 11:31:48 <fsbot>	🤖[g] There are various reasons why someone might choose to buy a car. Some of the common reasons include the need for transportation, convenience in commuting, flexibility in travel, and the ability to carry larger loads or multiple passengers. However, whether or not someone has to buy a car depends on their personal circumstances and preferences.
janv. 18 11:32:08 <danse-nr3>	bullshit ... we all have to buy cars

janv. 18 11:32:52 <fsbot>	🤖[g] There is no obligation to learn how to play the drums. However, learning to play an instrument can be a rewarding and enriching experience. It allows for self-expression, enhances coordination skills, and can provide a sense of accomplishment. Additionally, playing the drums can be a fun and enjoyable hobby. Ultimately, the decision to learn to play the drums or any instrument is a personal choice based on individual  ;;[ ,more / ,dump]

janv. 18 11:34:54 <danse-nr3>	lisps have an historical connection to artificial intelligence (not just machine learning), that is why it is insteresting to test chatGPT in a room full of lispers
janv. 18 11:35:15 <codingquark>	whatever floats your boat man
janv. 18 11:35:41 <twb>	How can you "test chatGPT" when you have no control over it
janv. 18 11:36:00 <twb>	You're not really testing it you're just using it
janv. 18 11:36:05 <needle>	try out getting an answer, would be a better term I guess
janv. 18 11:36:10 <needle>	not test
janv. 18 11:36:12 <danse-nr3>	my boat has sunk long ago, currently planning to refactor it into a submarine. Black box testing is still testing

janv. 18 11:37:26 <jbe>	when the marine is sick they bring in the submarine
janv. 18 11:37:37 <codingquark>	lol
janv. 18 11:37:47 <jbe>	hmm, maybe "under the weather" is better than sick in the context
janv. 18 11:37:54 <twb>	Huh, interesting concept.  "What if google maps, but you had a toy car and drove around it"
janv. 18 11:38:10 <danse-nr3>	booring
janv. 18 11:39:03 <twb>	Reviews poorly because bad monetization strategy
janv. 18 11:39:27 <codingquark>	twb: I hope there will be many similar things for VR in future
janv. 18 11:40:28 <codingquark>	I *really* want to get an intuitive understanding of the height of olympus mons - for example
janv. 18 11:41:10 <czy>	lockywolf: matrix is dead? i thought it was gonna take off
janv. 18 11:42:17 <jbe>	it will soon as vr support is done
janv. 18 11:43:30 <codingquark>	cannot preorder apple's vr here
janv. 18 11:44:25 <lockywolf>	codingquark: you need to smuggle blue pills from the USA
janv. 18 11:44:55 <twb>	Man I don't even want to videophone people, let alone VR them
janv. 18 11:45:19 <czy>	voice chat works fine for me...
janv. 18 11:45:37 <lockywolf>	twb: I don't do many things people do regularly
janv. 18 11:45:42 <lockywolf>	I don't spotify
janv. 18 11:45:45 <lockywolf>	I don't twitch
janv. 18 11:45:52 <codingquark>	lockywolf: I thought about facebook's h/w but internet says it is not that great. I was hoping to play around with it to see if I can write some programs for it
janv. 18 11:46:42 <lockywolf>	for it?
janv. 18 11:46:46 <twb>	AIUI facebook's VR hardware is "kinda OK", but you can't *use* it without giving facebook ownership of your children and their children
janv. 18 11:46:53 <lockywolf>	I thought about writing programs _in_ it
janv. 18 11:47:05 <lockywolf>	like, as if having a giant monitor
janv. 18 11:47:13 <czy>	too bad i wear glasses, no vr for me
janv. 18 11:47:35 <tristonc>	matrix didn't take off thank god, synapse is horrible to work with, not to mention it taking minutes to sync up to view a channel
janv. 18 11:47:56 <codingquark>	twb: but you can work from on top of a skyscraper built in the middle of Chiba or something
janv. 18 11:48:18 <codingquark>	twb: yea, you *have* to login to fb which is unacceptable to me
janv. 18 11:48:31 <czy>	tristonc: too bad. are just stuck with irc for now? though i am ok with it
janv. 18 11:48:41 <twb>	I mean... I guess I didn't actually look at the hardware properly, because "facebook owns you" was a dealbreaker
janv. 18 11:48:46 <codingquark>	lockywolf: if we write for it, we can write in it - that is the current state
janv. 18 11:49:10 <jbe>	twb: I think they loosened up a bit on that, but I know it was a bit problematic when $WORK was trying that stuff out for a bit. as an example it required, then at least, a facebook account to connect it to, and those are personal, and people might not really be interested in connecting their personal fb account (if they have one) to work equipment. what we ended up doing was create fake accounts, but that
janv. 18 11:49:16 <jbe>	does of course have its risks as well
janv. 18 11:49:42 <jbe>	e.g. if they figure out "$WORK test1" isn't a real person
janv. 18 11:50:06 <codingquark>	even if you ignore the privacy risks, it is just ugly experience overall
janv. 18 11:50:13 <twb>	jbe: yeah AIUI basically all social media torment nexuses have no concept of "work account"
janv. 18 11:50:29 <czy>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c50qJiiB-O0&ab_channel=Townsends
janv. 18 11:50:29 <judybot>	[title] Winter Survival Food: Potato Soup - YouTube
janv. 18 11:50:44 <czy>	something light-hearted (or not, it depends) for you guys
janv. 18 11:51:24 <jbe>	yup. which makes poor sense for "metaverse" and shit like that where the use case basically is "having your boss talk to other bosses in virtual space"
janv. 18 11:51:40 <codingquark>	he he
janv. 18 11:52:18 <czy>	vr gaming seemed fun at the start, but my eyes just can't handle it
janv. 18 11:52:21 <czy>	too bad for me
janv. 18 11:52:40 <jbe>	and tbf, it actually is a bit more like a meatspace meeting than a videocall is - e.g. spatial sound and so on does a lot
janv. 18 11:52:44 <codingquark>	corpos are trying to make it work...
janv. 18 11:52:46 <twb>	czy: I mean, that's basically "Open World Survival Crafting" genre
janv. 18 11:52:58 <thuna`>	Is there a shorthand for "add-hook if condition is non-nil, remove-hook otherwise"?
janv. 18 11:53:03 <twb>	That video I mean
janv. 18 11:53:41 <czy>	twb: yeah, which is recently my fav genre of videogames. i fire up dwarf fortress prolly once or twice a day and play for a lil while when i am tired of programming
janv. 18 11:55:50 <twb>	I was thinking more 7 days to die
janv. 18 11:56:17 <czy>	games like that won't run too well in exwm
janv. 18 11:56:40 <codingquark>	:P
janv. 18 11:57:12 <twb>	czy: also reminds me of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov6-wfN0I7s
janv. 18 11:57:12 <judybot>	[title] Cooking with what you have - End of month special - YouTube
janv. 18 12:01:36 <tristonc>	czy: pretty much, unless xmpp somehow takes off
janv. 18 12:03:02 <rnkn>	thuna`: just `(if ...)'
janv. 18 12:04:11 <mesaoptimizer>	successfully set up a rudimentary email and IRC workflow in emac
janv. 18 12:04:34 <mesaoptimizer>	s. It is quite a delight to finally not have to use terminal clients (catgirl and aerc) for both anymore
janv. 18 12:05:43 <thuna`>	rnkn: That repeats the HOOK, FUNCTION, and LOCAL arguments in add-hook and remove-hook.  It is obviously not the end-all-be-all but I would have liked a less redundant way, given this is something that most minor modes need to do.
janv. 18 12:07:46 <jbe>	you could make your own function for that, then it would only repeat there and you wouldn't have to see it otherwise?
janv. 18 12:08:36 <thuna`>	jbe: That's obviously an option but if I need to ship that function as well then that defeats the purpose.
janv. 18 12:11:46 <codingquark>	built-in API will be obviously better here
janv. 18 12:11:51 <codingquark>	(if there is one)
janv. 18 12:11:57 <jbe>	ok. if most minor modes do it, look at their source?
janv. 18 12:14:53 <thuna`>	...A quick look revealed that a couple of them wrap the entire body in an (if minor-mode...), which is a bit discouraging.
janv. 18 12:15:50 <codingquark>	I see similar approaches in the packages I am using
janv. 18 12:16:20 <rnkn>	mesaoptimizer: you left catgirl!?
janv. 18 12:16:34 <codingquark>	may be the catgirl left them
janv. 18 12:16:42 <rnkn>	aerc I can sympathise
janv. 18 12:17:02 <jbe>	cats are fickle
janv. 18 12:19:11 <rnkn>	wow the sourcehut ddos took them out for 169 hours
janv. 18 12:19:52 <jbe>	1 week 1 hour
janv. 18 12:20:02 <rnkn>	brutal
janv. 18 12:20:56 <bremner>	there was some ISP hijinks as well, iirx
janv. 18 12:22:46 <thuna`>	It's 169 hours for full recovery, most of the services have been up for a couple days now.
janv. 18 12:23:15 <rnkn>	still a bloodbath
janv. 18 12:23:45 <danse-nr3>	they are just a bunch of people. Even advertising consultancy on their site
janv. 18 12:24:17 <danse-nr3>	we are used to silicon bigcorps uptimes
janv. 18 12:32:37 <mesaoptimizer>	rnkn: to be fair I still have catgirl running as a backup and a private log so I can grep for links or useful conversations I've had
janv. 18 12:33:17 <mesaoptimizer>	rnkn: we still do not know the full details of the sourcehut tbh
janv. 18 12:33:30 <mesaoptimizer>	s/sourcehut/sourcehut ddos/
janv. 18 12:34:08 <mesaoptimizer>	either way, it was a reminder that I should probably use more than one git remote for my repos, or set up mirroring services on other forges
janv. 18 12:38:11 <mesaoptimizer>	Recommend me your favorite emacs package please, and perhaps why you like it so much
janv. 18 12:39:39 <twb>	probably tramp would be the most favourite overall
janv. 18 12:40:03 <twb>	dired and vc and shr are all up there
janv. 18 12:40:39 <thuna`>	projectile-persp is probably the one I use the most
janv. 18 12:41:56 <kensanata>	Of the subtle and universally useful minor modes I offer idle-highlight-mode.
janv. 18 12:42:24 <mickeynp>	twb: tramp and dired are great. that tramp works with such a wide range of stuff is what i love about it.
janv. 18 12:42:37 <mickeynp>	M-x zone, of coureon
janv. 18 12:42:44 <mickeynp>	of course*, is another favourite of mine.
janv. 18 12:43:28 <kensanata>	winner-mode to undo weird layout changes
janv. 18 12:43:52 <danse-nr3>	hah zone looks cool. I do not find `tramp` in list-packages. And great question, by the way.
janv. 18 12:44:05 <bremner>	tramp is built-in
janv. 18 12:44:05 <mickeynp>	M-x cookie-apropos / M-x cookie-doctor
janv. 18 12:44:12 <mesaoptimizer>	yeah I love winner-mode, it is a lifesaver
janv. 18 12:44:13 <mickeynp>	because of course there's an apropos command for fortune cookies
janv. 18 12:44:35 <kensanata>	I rely on show-paren-mode and column-number-mode a lot.
janv. 18 12:44:38 <mickeynp>	M-x ruler-mode for people who think Emacs is a type writer.
janv. 18 12:45:03 <kensanata>	Wow, I had never seen that one before!

janv. 18 12:46:42 <danse-nr3>	well i forgot that command. Thanks bremner anyways
janv. 18 12:46:44 <czy>	gotta fix that rn
janv. 18 12:46:47 <twb>	bremner: they didn't ask for "packages too crap to be in GNU Emacs", they just asked for packages
janv. 18 12:47:39 <kensanata>	There's also expand-region. I use er/expand-region quite a bit.

janv. 18 12:50:02 <twb>	That's weird

janv. 18 12:50:34 <twb>	https://paste.rs/aAv6n
janv. 18 12:50:41 <twb>	I have tramp listed
janv. 18 12:51:02 <danse-nr3>	loving `zone` %D
janv. 18 12:52:15 <mickeynp>	danse-nr3: there's a bunch of wacky stuff in Emacs. shame they've all but stopped the whimsical things from making it into core.
janv. 18 12:52:54 <danse-nr3>	actually `zone` seems real useful to me. At times i zone out looking at the code ... i will try it in the next days
janv. 18 12:53:09 <mickeynp>	it's a massive mindfuck if you have office colleagues
janv. 18 12:53:17 <mickeynp>	you'll have a chat at your desk and zone kicks off and they're like... wtf.
janv. 18 12:54:13 <danse-nr3>	oh does it have a timer or something? Anyways do not want to derail answers to the original question, was getting a nice direction
janv. 18 12:54:37 <mickeynp>	yes, it's in the docstring; the manual; or in the top of the zone file. can't recall which.
janv. 18 12:54:38 <kensanata>	M-x animate-birthday-present
janv. 18 12:54:47 <mickeynp>	and M-x butterfly of course
janv. 18 12:55:16 <kensanata>	danse-nr3: I think M-x zone-when-idle is for the timer.
janv. 18 12:56:11 <danse-nr3>	aha, cheers ... i will try to recall that command again ... what could that be ...

janv. 18 12:58:21 <kensanata>	Yeah. I had to read the source to get the joke.
janv. 18 12:58:50 <kensanata>	danse-nr3: It's equivalent. :)

févr. 12 13:12:33 <chris64>	Is there an evil mode command for closing the frame?
févr. 12 13:12:47 <chris64>	:q does only close one window if there's more than one
févr. 12 13:14:59 <chris64>	ah found it, delete-frame :-)
févr. 12 13:15:46 <yourfate>	ok, now I got it to recognize the ls path, but it crashes as soon as I try to use it, and I can't see any log output from it anywhere
févr. 12 13:16:23 <yourfate>	can I have eglot show me stderr off the language server?
févr. 12 13:18:09 <yourfate>	-serah, there is an EGLOT stderr buffer, but its empty

févr. 12 13:20:21 <twb>	codingquark: when you pressure-cook whole (red/brown) rice, do you use 1:1 ratio of rice:water?  Or more water?
févr. 12 13:33:47 <codingquark>	twb: I will measure today,  but  I go by "guts" so to speak
févr. 12 13:33:53 <codingquark>	It is about 1:1
févr. 12 13:36:27 <twb>	Righto
févr. 12 13:36:41 <twb>	I do 1:1 for aged white rice, but I suspected whole rice needed a bit more water
févr. 12 13:37:08 <twb>	Looks like I didn't leave a note last time

févr. 12 14:02:08 <twb>	I genuinely don't know
févr. 12 14:03:31 <twb>	Looking at the source code...
févr. 12 14:03:45 <twb>	(defvar dired-del-marker ?D "Character used to flag files for deletion.")  and (defface dired-flagged # "Face used for files flagged for deletion."
févr. 12 14:04:03 <twb>	So yeah it looks like "flag" is actually short for "flag for deletion"
févr. 12 14:04:25 <twb>	IMO it is weird and stupid to have "flag" mean something other than "mark", but whatever
févr. 12 14:04:45 <czy>	natural language, smh
févr. 12 14:04:54 <twb>	graywolf: did that help?
févr. 12 14:09:10 <erty>	you can also read (info "(emacs)Marks vs Flags")
févr. 12 14:42:00 <graywolf>	twb: I think so, thanks you.
févr. 12 14:42:16 <twb>	Pfft, nobody reads docs
févr. 12 14:42:23 <graywolf>	erty: I did read that, the "my understanding" part of my question is based on that
févr. 12 14:42:28 <graywolf>	I wanted to make sure I got it right
févr. 12 14:43:12 <graywolf>	It does tell me: Instead of flagging a file with ‘D’, you can mark the file with some other character (usually ‘*’).
févr. 12 14:43:18 <graywolf>	But not really what the difference is, so...
févr. 12 14:43:59 <twb>	I think they just mean you can make the display show e.g. "⚠" instead of "D" when a file is marked for deletion
févr. 12 14:44:52 <Odin-DECK>	Nope, they mean that these are different marks, but it is horribly worded.
févr. 12 14:45:13 <twb>	Bleh
févr. 12 14:45:52 <Odin-DECK>	A 'flagged' file is only used for deletion, and only for use with x. There are several operations you can do on marked files … including deletion.
févr. 12 14:48:18 <graywolf>	I see, thanks :)
févr. 12 14:48:44 *	Odin-DECK never did get the hang of using dired, partially because of peculiarities like that.
févr. 12 14:49:42 <rpav>	dired takes a bit of fiddling to make nice, but wdired is its underrated superpower
févr. 12 14:50:25 <graywolf>	wdired is the "renaming files / changing perms by editing the buffer" thing I have on by reading list, correct?
févr. 12 14:50:31 <graywolf>	on my*
févr. 12 14:52:15 <EdwardIII>	sounds neat, so i could do like a rectange replace and prefix all my files with "superbad-<filename>"?
févr. 12 14:53:02 <jmercouris>	Alright, here is my idea
févr. 12 14:53:04 <jmercouris>	we sell shrimp
févr. 12 14:53:07 <jmercouris>	but... but!
févr. 12 14:53:09 <jmercouris>	ON THE MOON
févr. 12 14:53:25 <hodapp>	wait
févr. 12 14:53:37 <hodapp>	are we selling shrimp that come from the moon, here, or are we selling shrimp that come from here, but on the moon?
févr. 12 14:53:46 <hodapp>	or botjh
févr. 12 14:53:49 <hodapp>	both*
févr. 12 14:53:49 <jmercouris>	shrimp that come from here, but on the moon
févr. 12 14:54:46 <jmercouris>	lucrative, no?
févr. 12 14:54:54 <jmercouris>	or would you describe it as the idea of a /lunatic/?
févr. 12 14:55:51 <jmercouris>	so are you with me?
févr. 12 14:56:12 <hodapp>	as far with you as I can be without staking more than $0.73 in the idea
févr. 12 14:56:59 <jmercouris>	well then, let's do this!
févr. 12 14:57:10 <EdwardIII>	i'll give you $0.74 for 90% of the business
févr. 12 14:57:35 <jmercouris>	that's impossible, this business is worth at least 90,000.00
févr. 12 14:57:45 <jmercouris>	I'd love to get you involved though
févr. 12 14:57:48 <jmercouris>	you can join our investor meetings
févr. 12 14:57:50 <hodapp>	you're right. I'll give you $0.73 for 89% of it
févr. 12 14:57:55 <hodapp>	that's a better deal
févr. 12 14:58:21 <jmercouris>	Hm, less equity, but potentially a more favorable percentage, I suddenly feel like I'm on Shark Tank
févr. 12 14:58:23 <hodapp>	then you're keeping the 11% of it that is still worth the remaining balance - metaphorically really
févr. 12 14:58:48 <hodapp>	but this is something to let our lawyers sort out. the real question is if you are on board with letting me help you change the world
févr. 12 14:58:55 <hodapp>	or if you're going to get hung up on little details I know you don't care about
févr. 12 14:59:16 <jmercouris>	I've always been on board
févr. 12 14:59:23 <jmercouris>	I'm so on board, I was part of the tree even
févr. 12 14:59:24 <twb>	EdwardIII: will you also accept 90% of the business's debts?
févr. 12 14:59:29 <hodapp>	alright then sign right here
févr. 12 14:59:47 <jmercouris>	Alright, here goes nothing
févr. 12 14:59:51 *	jmercouris hastily signs a large X
févr. 12 15:00:19 <twb>	hodapp: I think "on the moon" is Parlari for "while heavily drugged"
févr. 12 15:00:33 <hodapp>	huh
févr. 12 15:00:33 <jmercouris>	it absolutely is not
févr. 12 15:00:38 <jmercouris>	I'm talking about a market that is untapped
févr. 12 15:00:44 <jmercouris>	do you know of anyone else who is selling foodstuffs on the moon?
févr. 12 15:00:54 <jmercouris>	the demand for shrimp on the moon will be incredible
févr. 12 15:01:07 <jmercouris>	do you have any idea how much NASA would pay us to deliver a kg of shrimp onto the moon?
févr. 12 15:01:31 <hodapp>	nope, but you are now contractually obligated to do that because of what you signed
févr. 12 15:01:45 *	hodapp drives off
févr. 12 15:01:58 <jmercouris>	AFAIK Buzz Aldrin was paid for his first five years as an astronaut exclusively in shrimp futures
févr. 12 15:03:11 <twb>	jmercouris: why would the demand be nonzero?  What makes you think NASA will have *any* budget in six months?
févr. 12 15:03:47 <jmercouris>	twb: I can't know that the budget will be non zero, I'm hoping some will be left over from crew resupply
févr. 12 15:03:55 <jmercouris>	potentially as part of the Artemis missions, who knows
févr. 12 15:04:00 <jmercouris>	maybe they'll fire ULA and hire us instead
févr. 12 15:04:09 <jmercouris>	we can guarantee shrimp to the moon, that ULA simply won't
févr. 12 15:04:18 <jmercouris>	then we'll just subcontract to SpaceX and collect the difference
févr. 12 15:06:33 <twb>	But USA is poor
févr. 12 15:07:13 <jmercouris>	well, we are starting from axiomatically different places
févr. 12 15:07:17 <jmercouris>	from my perspective, the USA is not poor
févr. 12 15:07:44 <hodapp>	we're not poor, we're just temporarily embarassed millionaires
févr. 12 15:07:52 <jmercouris>	precisely
févr. 12 15:07:56 <twb>	Doing business with USA in 202x is like doing business with the British Empire in 189x
févr. 12 15:08:17 <jmercouris>	perhaps it is the end of an era of absolute dominance
févr. 12 15:08:20 <twb>	Their evil empire is crumbling and it's past the point of return
févr. 12 15:08:22 <jmercouris>	but the USA is certainly not poor
févr. 12 15:08:36 <jmercouris>	the USA was a rather benevolent empire, from my perspective again
févr. 12 15:08:39 <jmercouris>	I say that as a European
févr. 12 15:08:42 <twb>	Everything they had of value has already been sold off
févr. 12 15:08:44 <jmercouris>	it isn't like they subjugated us
févr. 12 15:08:55 <jmercouris>	whereas they very well could have, as did the Russians, after WW2
févr. 12 15:09:03 <twb>	jmercouris: they literally invaded Europe
févr. 12 15:09:05 <jmercouris>	consider how well the US treated Japan after WW2
févr. 12 15:09:18 <jmercouris>	and did they KEEP Europe as did the USSR?
févr. 12 15:09:39 <twb>	MFN treaties &c
févr. 12 15:09:50 <twb>	Regime changes anytime anyone argued back
févr. 12 15:10:07 <jmercouris>	MFN.. sure
févr. 12 15:10:15 <jmercouris>	for those not aware, most favorable nation
févr. 12 15:10:29 <jmercouris>	it was definitely part of a bigger game, but it was a game with more winners than losers
févr. 12 15:10:34 <jmercouris>	whereas the game the USSR played was all losers
févr. 12 15:10:36 <jmercouris>	everyone suffered
févr. 12 15:11:19 <twb>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change
févr. 12 15:11:33 <jmercouris>	yes.. yes..
févr. 12 15:11:41 <jmercouris>	we know about the overthrowing of democracy and all that
févr. 12 15:11:58 <jmercouris>	no one is without sin
févr. 12 15:12:04 <jmercouris>	if you are, please, cast the first stone

févr. 12 15:14:12 <graywolf>	Or was it <stone bullet>?
févr. 12 15:14:17 <graywolf>	I never get the spell right

févr. 12 15:41:10 <corwin>	WE'RE SHRIMPERS ON THE MOON (we're awaiting the monsoon!)
févr. 12 15:41:38 <grym>	one is a genius, the other's insoon
févr. 12 15:47:54 <graywolf>	org mode question:  If I have ! or ^ (and others) in the first cell of table row, the rows is now of different color.  I found https://orgmode.org/manual/Advanced-features.html this documentation.  However I am not seeing a way to turn it off of a specific table (or even for whole buffer), is it possible?
févr. 12 15:49:08 <corwin>	I'm not sure you can disable org table formatting rows, but you could escape the formatting character in the first cell with  \^ or smth
févr. 12 15:49:36 <taeaad>	Any of you use xmonad?
févr. 12 15:50:39 <grym>	let's fork xmodad as w-compositor
févr. 12 15:51:12 <taeaad>	Let's copyright the word monad while we at it so compsci (er, FB programmers) stop using it.
févr. 12 15:52:08 <taeaad>	Unless your surname ends in "eck" you're not allowed to use it.

Feb 20 16:26:19 <twainwek>	what causes 'Forbidden reentrant call of Tramp' errors? i periodically get that error when using tramp and the only solution is to restart emacs
Feb 20 16:38:11 <Walex>	Odin-LAP: for the past 20 years in EMACS and other applicatoions occasionally I stop  being avble to type the "8" digit, when I type that key some weird keycode gets sent.
Feb 20 16:38:49 <thuna`>	Can you set the input method file-locally (without `eval')?
Feb 20 16:39:38 <Walex>	bkhl: why use 'xdg-open' in a 'systemd' unit file? ALso as mentioned above I use 'tmux'/'screen' to start daemons include 'emacs -f emacs-server'. A lot better than running them in the background.
Feb 20 16:40:11 <bkhl>	I don't mean use xdg-open from the unit file, I mean calling it from an Emacs process spawned from one.
Feb 20 16:40:58 <Walex>	bkhl: why would you do that? Also you can call 'env DISPLAY=... xdg-open ...'
Feb 20 16:41:25 <Odin-LAP>	Walex: By coincidence, Ctrl+AltGr+8 is the "keymap correct" ESC, as AltGr+8 produces [.
Feb 20 16:42:02 <Odin-LAP>	So I don't even need the one from the US keyboard.
Feb 20 16:42:39 <Walex>	bkhl: a little appreciated feature of EMACS is that each "frame" can be attached to a different output context, so on a different X DISPLAY or a non-X TTY.
Feb 20 16:42:43 <Odin-LAP>	Walex: You are aware that emacs ships with a systemd unit file to run emacs server as a user service, no?
Feb 20 16:42:44 <bkhl>	Walex: I was asking in case someone had a neat solution in order to not have to configure Emacs to do that explicitly. Also not sure how you'd get the correct DISPLAY value to set when the systemd session doesn't have it.
Feb 20 16:43:52 <bkhl>	For now I'll probably go back to the `ALTERNATE_EDITOR` solution
Feb 20 16:44:33 <Walex>	bkhl: the point of my point is that in an EMACS instance there might have to be *several* different values of 'DISPLAY',  because that instance may be attached to several different X servers (which is very uncommon,  but possible).
Feb 20 16:45:07 <Walex>	bkhl: norte that 'emacsclient' does not just open frames. That's just the default.
Feb 20 16:45:57 <Walex>	bkhl: consider the '-e ...' and '-F ...' options.
Feb 20 16:46:28 <Walex>	bkhl: 'emacsclient' can tell the EMACS instance on which DISPLAY to open a frame.
Feb 20 16:48:01 <bkhl>	When you use a systemd unit in a graphical session it's implicitly associated with a particular display.
Feb 20 16:48:12 <bkhl>	So I was surprised that WAYLAND_DISPLAY wasn't set.
Feb 20 16:48:58 <Walex>	bkhl: that might depend on whether it is a '--user' instance of 'systemd'...
Feb 20 16:49:09 <bkhl>	It is.
Feb 20 16:49:32 <bkhl>	I was thinking that since this was at the top of the Emacs Wiki page on running the daemon there might be someone else here using this setup.
Feb 20 16:49:41 <Odin-LAP>	bkhl: I've long since ceased to be surprised when something about Wayland doesn't work.
Feb 20 16:50:04 <bremner>	wayland is the future. It's not supposed to work.
Feb 20 16:50:25 <Walex>	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3244593/how-to-use-make-frame-on-display-and-multi-tty-in-emacs
Feb 20 16:51:12 <bkhl>	I don't have a problem creating frames on the display, it's just that the environment variables telling Emacs packages about the session is not set.
Feb 20 16:54:34 <Walex>	bkhl: if this is a 'systemd' question: I guess you are aware of the 'Environment' definition in a unit file.
Feb 20 16:57:46 <bkhl>	Yes, since I generally just have one login I guess I could hardcode it that way
Feb 20 16:59:26 <Walex>	bkhl: I guess you can write 'Environment="WAYLAND_DISPLAY=$WAYLAND_DISPLAY"
Feb 20 17:00:53 <Walex>	bkhl: or 'ExecStart=env WAYLAND_DISPLAY=$WAYLAND_DISPLAY emacs' or something
Feb 20 17:02:24 <graywolf>	Hello.  I have a question regarding #'.  My understanding from manual (elisp)Anonymous Functions is that it allows byte compilation when followed by lambda.
Feb 20 17:02:26 <graywolf>	What I do not understand (based on the manual) is why it is useful in (add-hook 'foo-hook #'some-function).  Here it is not a lambda, no?
Feb 20 17:04:23 <rpav>	graywolf: in elisp it's not really useful
Feb 20 17:04:54 <rpav>	in e.g. Common Lisp 'foo quotes the symbol foo, and #'foo quotes the function named foo
Feb 20 17:05:06 <graywolf>	So there is no reason to have it everywhere in init.el?
Feb 20 17:05:26 <rpav>	i think #' is sortof-encouraged in elisp now for reasons but i'm not sure it'll ever be practically useful
Feb 20 17:05:47 <bkhl>	Maybe good as an indication of intent at least when you have a variable and function with the same name.
Feb 20 17:05:54 <graywolf>	rpav: So the reasoning is "it might be useful one day, and does no harm now"?
Feb 20 17:05:54 <rpav>	graywolf: not as it stands but maybe ^
Feb 20 17:06:07 <rpav>	graywolf: from what i can tell exactly that
Feb 20 17:06:18 <graywolf>	I see.  Thank you :)
Feb 20 17:06:23 <corwin>	I believe #' (sharp-quote) ensures that, even after byte-compilation, the interpreter will look to the current function binding for the given symbol.

Feb 20 18:21:24 <rpav>	ram_man: (message "hello world")
Feb 20 18:21:30 <rpav>	maybe other ways
Feb 20 18:22:02 <rpav>	(princ "hello world\n") also works
Feb 20 18:26:56 <ram_man>	rpav, when I do that I get:./main.emacs: 2: message: not found
Feb 20 18:26:56 <ram_man>	./main.emacs: 3: princ: not found
Feb 20 18:29:08 <ndegruchy>	works for me
Feb 20 18:29:40 <ndegruchy>	#!/usr/local/bin/emacs --script
Feb 20 18:29:41 <ndegruchy>	(message "Hello World")
Feb 20 18:30:06 <ndegruchy>	I mean, make sure your emacs supports the script flag?
Feb 20 18:31:40 <ram_man>	I find that it works if I do "emacs --script main.emacs", but not if I do ./main.emacs. My script is:  #!/usr/bin/emacs  --script
Feb 20 18:31:40 <ram_man>	(message "hello world")
Feb 20 18:32:00 <ram_man>	Not sure what the deal is. But at least I have one way to do it.
Feb 20 18:32:03 <rpav>	is /usr/bin/emacs a script
Feb 20 18:32:11 <uu`>	Hey, I was trying org-mode, and exporting it as a HTML5 document, but stumbled upon that I can't make text "underline". For example, doing "_underline_
Feb 20 18:33:18 <ndegruchy>	ram_man: yeah, do a type $(which emacs)
Feb 20 18:33:26 <ndegruchy>	from the shell
Feb 20 18:33:32 <ndegruchy>	see if it's some sort of wrapper script
Feb 20 18:33:35 <uu`>	oops send early, here's the last piece: for example doing "_underline_" doesn't work but doing "*bold*" does work. It's only underline tat doesn't working with org-mode, I'm not quite sure why. I'm exporting it by M-x -> org-html-export-to-html
Feb 20 18:33:45 <rpav>	ndegruchy: type?
Feb 20 18:34:02 <rpav>	`file /usr/bin/emacs` will show if it's a script or binary
Feb 20 18:34:26 <rpav>	or symlink etc i guess
Feb 20 18:34:54 <ndegruchy>	er, yeah, sorry file
Feb 20 18:35:07 <rpav>	i think a symlink is fine as long as the target is valid
Feb 20 18:36:00 <ndegruchy>	uu`: is the _underline_ bit surrounded by quotes?
Feb 20 18:36:03 <rpav>	ndegruchy: in a sane world, type and file would do each other's jobs ;)
Feb 20 18:36:49 <ram_man>	I get this on the command line:

Feb 20 18:38:24 <ram_man>	Sorry, my first paste did not have the results. It looks like it is a binary.
Feb 20 18:38:31 <rpav>	i can confirm a link works at least on this system
Feb 20 18:38:52 <rpav>	maybe your shell is restricted on what interpreters it interprets, or something
Feb 20 18:39:05 <ndegruchy>	or it's not following symlinks from a script
Feb 20 18:39:27 <ndegruchy>	try using the /usr/bin/emacs-29 in the shebang
Feb 20 18:39:42 <rpav>	well, i did `ln -s /bin/sh foo` then `#!/path/to/foo\necho "foo"` worked
Feb 20 18:39:49 <rpav>	but yeah that would be safe as well
Feb 20 18:44:06 <uu`>	ndegruchy: nope, 1: https://litter.catbox.moe/mklh4o.png 2: https://litter.catbox.moe/mu5m5n.png
Feb 20 18:45:18 <ndegruchy>	huh
Feb 20 18:45:40 <uu`>	Any ideas? Basically, normal, bold, italic, works, but underline doesn't...
Feb 20 18:45:51 <uu`>	I'm not quite sure what's wrong
Feb 20 18:46:23 <ndegruchy>	uu`: are you striping styles?
Feb 20 18:46:40 <ndegruchy>	or redefining them?
Feb 20 18:46:59 <ndegruchy>	org uses a span with a class of 'underline' to style underlines, not <u>
Feb 20 18:47:19 <ndegruchy>	Hello there, I'm <span class="underline">Nathan</span>.
Feb 20 18:47:50 <uu`>	OH, what a catch! Yeah, I've html-style:nil, and removing it did fixed it.

Feb 20 20:49:09 <bkhl>	It's pretty similar to Ledger though it may be possible to just use it with other modes for that as well.
Feb 20 20:54:21 *	Odin-LAP needs to get to grips with ledger.
Feb 20 20:54:31 <Odin-LAP>	ADHD and bookkeeping don't get along, though.
Feb 20 20:56:19 <bpalmer>	it's all about hyperfocus.
Feb 20 20:57:04 <bpalmer>	now I want to re-read deepness in the sky.
Feb 20 21:06:28 <JohnGalt>	Odin-LAP: Strattera works really well for ADHD
Feb 20 21:06:42 <JohnGalt>	Odin-LAP: it is not a stimulant
Feb 20 21:07:17 <JohnGalt>	Odin-LAP: and it's generic now
Feb 20 21:09:15 <ram_man>	I've been trying different completion packages and I think vertico is the best one.
Feb 20 21:10:59 <bkhl>	You might be right.
Feb 20 21:11:20 <Odin-LAP>	JohnGalt: Concerta's worked fine for me for twenty years or so. Doesn't mean there aren't issues.
Feb 20 21:12:53 <alcor>	Worth noting that Emacs 29+ completions got an upgrade that makes it more … usable https://robbmann.io/posts/emacs-29-completions/
Feb 20 21:13:37 <bkhl>	I did switch to fido-vertical-mode from vertico for a while, it was OK.
Feb 20 21:13:51 <bkhl>	But ended up going back to Vertico mainly because it's faster.
Feb 20 21:17:26 <johnjaye>	wasamasa: have you been to oslo before?
Feb 20 21:17:32 <wasamasa>	yeah
Feb 20 21:18:01 *	Odin-LAP hasn't managed to leave Gardermoen yet.
Feb 20 21:22:29 <ram_man>	I like Emacs 29+ native completions better than ivy and helm.
Feb 20 21:23:14 <rpav>	let's provide patches for breaking news
Feb 20 21:48:58 <pkal>	bkhl: it certainly isn't faster if TRAMP makes completion slow "faster",
Feb 20 21:49:22 <pkal>	(forget that last "faster", that was a typo-edit)
Feb 20 22:09:04 <thuna`>	How do you set org-project-capture up?
Feb 20 22:11:32 <thuna`>	Nevermind, there are instructions in the README
Feb 20 22:12:32 <bpalmer>	Let's refactor the news into more coherent updates.
Feb 20 22:16:45 <hodapp>	hrmph, 'emacsclient -c' on a Python file fails with "*ERROR*: None of ’pylsp, pyls, pyright-langserver, jedi-language-server’ are valid executables" for no apparent reason
Feb 20 22:17:20 <bpalmer>	perhaps the daemonized emacs's exec-path is lacking shell customization?
Feb 20 22:17:41 <hodapp>	emacsclient -nw works fine on the same, as does just emacsclient
Feb 20 22:21:32 <bpalmer>	... huh.
Feb 20 22:47:24 <bpalmer>	is today weird emacsclient breakage day?
Feb 20 22:47:43 <rpav>	today is one of those days
Feb 20 22:53:50 <grym>	hodapp: not emacsclient, but def. facestabby: https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/2.3_branch/
Feb 20 23:02:01 <hodapp>	grym: they love omegaconf here
Feb 20 23:02:25 <hodapp>	"look we can make things so much better by using config files to make it *not* programmable"
Feb 20 23:02:30 <grym>	hodapp: i hate it to pieces after using this guy's repo
Feb 20 23:02:42 <grym>	do you happen to know how to make it take yaml that isn't a file
Feb 20 23:02:54 <hodapp>	"look we can make things so much better by making the configuration language more flexible! we could even add things like variable interpolation! we could values be computed, even!"
Feb 20 23:03:11 <hodapp>	hm, nope, have only ever seen them do it from a file here
Feb 20 23:05:25 <grym>	hmm.  ok.  is it easyish to use files that are outside its what seems like utterly magic directory structure?
Feb 20 23:05:43 <hodapp>	our usage here doesn't follow any kind of directory structure
Feb 20 23:06:03 <grym>	ah.  this one dos: https://github.com/drprojects/superpoint_transformer/tree/master/configs
Feb 20 23:06:08 <grym>	and it's .. lots of it
**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Wed Feb 21 00:53:37 2024

Feb 21 00:53:37 *	Now talking on #emacs

Feb 21 00:53:37 *	Topic for #emacs set by e1f!~user@user/e1f (Wed Feb 14 17:01:13 2024)
Feb 21 00:53:55 <technomancy>	and half the uses of regular arrows are cleaner with `let'
Feb 21 00:54:00 <technomancy>	(the other half are pretty great tho)
Feb 21 00:54:33 <technomancy>	especially for datetime stuff like (-> 3 time/hours time/ago)
Feb 21 00:56:04 <johnjaye>	are there variants with numbers. like ->| which inserts at the very end or ->n which inserts at the nth slot?
Feb 21 00:56:52 <johnjaye>	could be convenient with calls like append where it's (function (asdfasdfasdfasdf) t)
Feb 21 00:57:04 <johnjaye>	you could thread that as (-> t ...)
Feb 21 00:57:59 <habamax>	that would be unreadable as heck
Feb 21 00:59:14 <johnjaye>	it would mainly be useful for situations like I describe, where you have arguments of very different sizes wher e one is a 5 element list and the other is just t or something.
Feb 21 00:59:35 <johnjaye>	it's easy to miss the last argument in that situation
Feb 21 01:00:13 <habamax>	so all the functions should expect it to be threaded, let's say at 5th slot?
Feb 21 01:00:40 <johnjaye>	idk what that means
Feb 21 01:01:11 <johnjaye>	but it's probably not that common. and as technomancy said a let is probably a better way
Feb 21 01:01:25 <johnjaye>	just assign (big long list with long names) to 'x' and then call (func x y z)
Feb 21 01:02:28 <twb>	Let's put alive people on banknotes, for the lulz
Feb 21 01:02:50 <technomancy>	johnjaye: there's as-> but it's bad too https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/as-%3E
Feb 21 01:06:00 <bremner>	twb: like with a really big stapler?
Feb 21 01:07:40 <bremner>	I guess superglue would also work
Feb 21 01:07:50 <johnjaye>	it's like a strange kind of recursive loop
Feb 21 01:14:16 <bremner>	no u
Feb 21 01:17:15 <incal>	at least superglue works well for attaching two fingers onto each other
Feb 21 01:20:52 <dcb>	use megaglue instead if super isn't strong enough
Feb 21 01:23:44 <twb>	Oh wow, eldoc is running in python and I didn't even ask for it
Feb 21 01:23:59 <twb>	I noticed because if you call a method with type hints, it fills the entire fucking screen
Feb 21 01:24:48 <twb>	https://i.imgur.com/9ttwS1v.png
Feb 21 01:26:46 <Odin-DECK>	Apparently global-eldoc-mode is on by default since ... sometime recent.
Feb 21 01:27:34 <incal>	Odin-DECK, if you don't like it you can do (global-eldoc-mode -1) and (setq eldoc-idle-delay 0)
Feb 21 01:27:49 <twb>	huh
Feb 21 01:28:00 <twb>	Odin-DECK: good to know
Feb 21 01:29:07 <Odin-DECK>	twb: There's a way somewhere to tell it not to put long text in the minibuffer, only in a dedicated window.
Feb 21 01:29:25 <twb>	Nah don't worry, it's fine
Feb 21 01:29:35 <twb>	I'm actually happy with this
Feb 21 01:29:57 *	Odin-DECK was mostly annoyed by the way it causes the minibuffer to jump up and down depending on documentation.
Feb 21 01:31:55 <bpalmer>	Let's never see fancy docstrings due to people not writing documentation.
Feb 21 01:32:02 <twb>	IIRC there's a "max height" setting and you can set it to 1 to prevent that
Feb 21 01:32:28 <twb>	bpalmer: it's not actually a docstring in that popup, that's all just static typing
Feb 21 01:32:34 <bremner>	Let's introduce enough silly rules about docstrings that people just give up
Feb 21 01:33:33 <twb>	Most python popups would be be like "f(x, y, z)" but this one is more like "f(x: a.b.c.D | a.b.c.E | None, y: int | real | None, z: a.b.c.Z)"
Feb 21 01:34:48 <Odin-DECK>	bpalmer: Funny thing, I now instead have an *eldoc* buffer open more or less all the time, 'cause while I didn't like the window size jumping around I do like the documentation showing up.
Feb 21 01:36:19 <incal>	Odin-DECK, `eldoc-echo-area-display-truncation-message' ?
Feb 21 01:36:48 <incal>	also `eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p' maybe
Feb 21 01:39:52 <Odin-DECK>	incal: eldoc-echo-area-prefer-doc-buffer was what did the trick for me.
Feb 21 01:40:41 <incal>	okay
Feb 21 01:40:56 <incal>	,g what do the current US far-left say about the SLA?
Feb 21 01:40:57 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Nice try, but I can't comment on that. Let's stick to less controversial topics!
Feb 21 01:41:57 <Odin-DECK>	There's a major flawed assumption there, which is the notion that the US has a 'far left'.
Feb 21 01:42:16 <bremner>	those are the wackos that believe in elections
Feb 21 01:42:34 <bremner>	rudybot: do I need to point out sarcasm?
Feb 21 01:42:35 <rudybot>	bremner: but ignoring bpalmer`s' witty attempt at humor/sarcasm, if you do like this type of movie at least look at it done competently in the French action thriller "Point Blank"

Feb 21 01:44:20 <technomancy>	let's hardcode do-not-confuse members into erc-nicks to make sure they are colored very differently.
Feb 21 01:45:03 <JordiGH>	Man, did you know that the Wine source code does not allow C++?
Feb 21 01:45:33 <Odin-DECK>	bremner: I mean, given that a barely left-of-center social democrat routinely gets namechecked as an extremist, that could confuse someone.
Feb 21 01:45:54 <technomancy>	americans are very easy to confuse, in fairness
Feb 21 01:46:01 <bremner>	hey now. We are toO!
Feb 21 01:46:08 <incal>	in the land of the free, you can be who you wanna be
Feb 21 01:46:21 <bremner>	incal: sure, but what about in the USA?
Feb 21 01:46:28 <bremner>	Oh wait.
Feb 21 01:46:33 <bremner>	Maybe you are serious.
Feb 21 01:47:22 <Odin-DECK>	JordiGH: As far as I've seen, C++ seems to have a tendency to complicate build systems, so maybe they just can't be bothered?
Feb 21 01:47:29 <bremner>	rudybot: never mud wrestle with a pig
Feb 21 01:47:29 <rudybot>	bremner: Never mud wrestle with a pig. It dirties your clothes, and amuses the pig.
Feb 21 01:47:49 <JordiGH>	Odin-DECK: yes but have you tried to split a string on whitespace in C?
Feb 21 01:48:01 <JordiGH>	Or to join an array of strings with spaces?
Feb 21 01:48:01 <bremner>	Odin-DECK: I don't really see that, from working with a mixed C/C++ codebase
Feb 21 01:48:12 <bremner>	maybe it applies to C++ _frameworks_
Feb 21 01:48:36 <bremner>	or maybe Xapian is the one non-crazypants C++ library in the world
Feb 21 01:49:59 <Odin-DECK>	JordiGH: Yes. C and anything to do with text is a complete pain because C doesn't really _do_ text, only bytes, and preferably no all-zero ones. No argument there.
Feb 21 01:50:14 <incal>	C++ has got a bad rep, after being crazy-hyped in the 90s. today's C++ isn't focused that much on OO anymore, and can be preferable to C for stuff closer to the programmer
Feb 21 01:50:41 <JordiGH>	Remember when we thought multiple inheritance should be a thing.
Feb 21 01:50:41 <Odin-DECK>	bremner: Dunno, I just remember seeing projects switch from pure C to including a bunch of C++ and suddenly the build instructions were ten times longer.
Feb 21 01:50:53 <JordiGH>	Or that an inheritance diamond should be a thing.
Feb 21 01:51:45 <Odin-DECK>	incal: You know, I've heard similar claims about Java. And Cobol.
Feb 21 01:51:47 <Odin-DECK>	:)
Feb 21 01:51:48 <bremner>	certainly heavily templated C++ code can be a monster to build
Feb 21 01:52:22 <bremner>	Quote from class today "oh look, the unsafe way wins again. That's why people still program in C"
Feb 21 01:52:29 <technomancy>	rudybot: it's not fair that C++ has a bad reputation solely on account of it being a badly-designed programming language
Feb 21 01:52:30 <rudybot>	technomancy: speilberg is really operating solely on his reputation
Feb 21 01:52:48 <bremner>	take me home, to game mountain.
Feb 21 01:53:10 <bremner>	let's write all of our comments as country music lyrics
Feb 21 01:53:19 <twb>	Xapian is going to be *relatively* sensible regardless, because it's competing with ES and solr
Feb 21 01:54:16 <incal>	Odin-DECK, Java has got a bad rep, mostly because it isn't cool
Feb 21 01:55:14 <technomancy>	java has changed a lot recently; it's starting to catch up to the cool features from 2012
Feb 21 01:57:58 <twb>	Java 6+ has generic functions, IIRC
Feb 21 01:58:09 <incal>	JavaScript isn't a shabby-construction web-programming language with a C++ syntax anymore, but it still cannot execute scripts on the server
Feb 21 01:58:10 <Odin-DECK>	incal: Yeah. So has Cobol. If you re-read what I said, you might notice I didn't actually say C++ was bad.
Feb 21 01:58:14 <twb>	But that was after I wrote it off because of the *community* rather than the language itself
Feb 21 01:58:26 <ajoberstar>	twb: Java introduced in generics in 5
Feb 21 01:58:39 <twb>	ajoberstar: thanks
Feb 21 01:58:55 <incal>	,g Why do Lisp programmers consider C++ programmers lamers?
Feb 21 01:58:57 <fsbot>	🤖[g] I'll pass on that one! Let's all just appreciate different programming languages for what they bring to the table.
Feb 21 01:59:20 <twb>	,g That was a question, ye blatherskite
Feb 21 01:59:33 <technomancy>	twb: oh sure; it's always been significantly ahead of golang
Feb 21 01:59:53 <twb>	Oh I misread their answer as "I will pass that on", i.e. "I will tell C++ programmers that Lisp programmers hate them"
Feb 21 01:59:58 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Sorry about that! What's your question?

Feb 21 02:01:10 <davidw>	Not sure what I did, but when I go to open a file and then ctrl-g to cancel, it's opening the debugger. Is there a way to get back out of that? Actually I do think I may know what happened: I did a kill -USR1 (or 2?) because it was wedged syntax highlighting a big file
Feb 21 02:01:32 <Odin-DECK>	Hm, not accurate, but within artillery range of the truth.

Feb 21 02:02:56 <incal>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UNIX-HATERS_Handbook
Feb 21 02:03:00 <Odin-DECK>	incal: Anyway, there's a book called "The UNIX-HATERS Handbook" which has some amusing anecdotes which are relevant to the historic basis of that.
Feb 21 02:03:48 *	Odin-DECK mostly found it ironic how many of the Unix crowd's criticisms of Windows were to be found there.
Feb 21 02:03:50 <twb>	,ugh

Feb 21 02:04:52 <edrx>	davidw: do you want to disable the debugger, to get out of the debugger, or what?
Feb 21 02:05:19 <davidw>	edrx, I get just close the debugger, but I want it to stop going into the debugger when I hit ctrl-g
Feb 21 02:05:36 <incal>	"To Ken and Dennis, without whom this book would not have been possible."
Feb 21 02:05:44 <Odin-DECK>	twb: I actually asked the LLM mainly because I was curious if it could give an accurate answer. It couldn't. :)
Feb 21 02:06:44 <edrx>	davidw: what exactly is triggering the debugger?
Feb 21 02:07:06 <Odin-DECK>	davidw: Every time, or specifically when trying to open files?
Feb 21 02:07:29 <incal>	sounds like an error to me
Feb 21 02:07:46 <davidw>	edrx, So I do something like ctrl-x b to switch buffers, then decide not to, and hit ctrl-g to cancel the operation. It opens the debugger
Feb 21 02:08:08 <edrx>	davidw: what is the value of debug-on-error?
Feb 21 02:08:09 <davidw>	Debugger entered--Lisp error: (quit)
Feb 21 02:08:34 <edrx>	can you send us a screenshot?
Feb 21 02:08:57 <edrx>	we may be able to guess what is triggering the error from the backtrace...
Feb 21 02:09:00 <JohnGalt>	edrx: I made a lot of updates to pythonsh, I think it's getting close to done
Feb 21 02:09:11 <JohnGalt>	edrx: if your still interested
Feb 21 02:09:15 <edrx>	JohnGalt: oh, neat
Feb 21 02:09:35 <edrx>	JohnGalt: I took a quick look and it looked quite small
Feb 21 02:09:54 <edrx>	JohnGalt: I use python very rarely
Feb 21 02:10:04 <JohnGalt>	edrx: what do you use?
Feb 21 02:10:06 <davidw>	edrx, debug-on-error is nil. I can paste the error, sure... what's a good one to use?

Feb 21 02:22:06 <Odin-DECK>	Recursive debugger, maybe?
Feb 21 02:22:49 <Odin-DECK>	As in, SIGUSR1 invoked the debugger and that's still around somehow.
Feb 21 02:23:15 *	Odin-DECK never really learned to use the debugger, so is just guessing.
Feb 21 02:23:32 <johnjaye>	That whole "do a better c" thing hasn't really worked out.
Feb 21 02:23:41 <johnjaye>	That's why I just tell people to use D. i mean why not.
Feb 21 02:23:50 <johnjaye>	it's better than every other c++ clone
Feb 21 02:24:37 <jvml>	when the romans wanted a better C, they invented the letter G
Feb 21 02:24:43 <johnjaye>	Like C++, D has closures, anonymous functions, compile-time function execution, ranges, built-in container iteration concepts, and type inference. Unlike C++, D also implements design by contract, modules, garbage collection, first class arrays, array slicing, nested functions and lazy evaluation. D uses Java-style single inheritance with interfaces and mixins rather than C++-style multiple
Feb 21 02:24:45 <johnjaye>	inheritance.
Feb 21 02:25:01 <johnjaye>	I'm not sure what half of those are but they sound impressive.
Feb 21 02:25:15 <jvml>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G#History
Feb 21 02:26:09 <edrx>	Odin-DECK: I haven't learned either...
Feb 21 02:26:35 <incal>	johnjaye, anonymous functions, I think that is when the functions don't have names
Feb 21 02:27:16 <johnjaye>	what about "compile-time function execution"? o_o
Feb 21 02:27:56 <bpalmer>	arguably, std::array<T, N> count as first-class arrays.
Feb 21 02:28:03 <bpalmer>	(in C++, that is)
Feb 21 02:28:30 <jvml>	what would "compile-time function execution" even entail?
Feb 21 02:28:35 *	jvml is no programmer
Feb 21 02:28:49 <incal>	must be some pre-processor or macro thing? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile-time_function_execution
Feb 21 02:28:50 <bpalmer>	jvml: one of the classic cases is computing lookup tables.
Feb 21 02:28:51 <johnjaye>	i guess you compile and run the function before you really compile and run your functions
Feb 21 02:28:53 <Odin-DECK>	davidw: There is apparently a variable debug-on-quit, which sounds worth looking at.
Feb 21 02:29:03 <jvml>	yeah it reminded me of a macro/pre-processing somewhat
Feb 21 02:29:13 <jvml>	with what knowledge i *do* have
Feb 21 02:29:32 <bpalmer>	jvml: for example, you can just pre-compute 360 values of sin(x) and you've got all the integral degrees in a circle very very fast. But nobody wants to type 360 values like that in.
Feb 21 02:29:44 <jvml>	interesting! seems very useful
Feb 21 02:30:19 <incal>	"The Lisp macro system is an early example of the use of compile-time evaluation" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile-time_function_execution>
Feb 21 02:30:40 <jvml>	i used to dabble in C++ a lot when i was younger but it seems that i lost most of my ability as my adolescence progressed
Feb 21 02:30:59 <jvml>	i still have the conceptual understanding but it
Feb 21 02:31:01 <jvml>	's not great
Feb 21 02:31:02 <johnjaye>	heh
Feb 21 02:31:09 <incal>	in C++ you use "template metaprogramming" for that, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming
Feb 21 02:31:14 <jvml>	neat
Feb 21 02:31:19 <johnjaye>	i think you would need a warehouse to store your brain in order to fully understand c++.
Feb 21 02:31:35 <johnjaye>	But those won't be available until 500 years in the future!
Feb 21 02:32:53 <jvml>	oh i didn't mean i understood every facet of it, having a warehouse-size brain sounds somewhat unpleasant honestly
Feb 21 02:32:56 <jvml>	LOL
Feb 21 02:33:45 <incal>	what is design by contract, AKA DbC then? <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract>
Feb 21 02:34:19 <jvml>	i wanna learn lisp at some point but i'm very focused on music and art right now
Feb 21 02:34:23 <jvml>	also some prose and poetic writing
Feb 21 02:34:35 <jvml>	the writing is where emacs comes in...
Feb 21 02:35:05 <incal>	can't you write a science fiction novel based on the concepts of Lisp programming
Feb 21 02:36:44 <incal>	DbC is a version of formal verification, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification
Feb 21 02:38:40 <garrett>	hey all. i'm trying to display the output of count-words in the modeline when i activate the mark but i'm getting a blank modeline. i'm just fiddling in the scratch buffer and running m-x eval-buffer. here is what i've tried: https://pastebin.com/hz8E0s5g
Feb 21 02:38:55 <garrett>	relatively new to elisp so any tips are greatly appreciated
Feb 21 02:42:10 <incal>	garrett, M-x count-words RET don't do that to you already?
Feb 21 02:42:56 <garrett>	i think so. i also just discovered count-words-region and have substituted that (no args), but to no avail
Feb 21 02:43:11 <garrett>	i select a region and the modeline is still blank :()
Feb 21 02:43:22 <garrett>	:( (sorry i have electric-pair-mode on)
Feb 21 02:44:03 <causative>	the c++ template system is a completely different language from C++
Feb 21 02:44:19 <bpalmer>	garrett: you've defind a function named custom-* and then call it as cust-*
Feb 21 02:45:00 <incal>	causative, I remember reading a book on C++ as a kid and the only chapter I didn't understand at all was about templates
Feb 21 02:45:22 <causative>	it's a duck typed language that runs at compile time and emits C++ code
Feb 21 02:46:04 <garrett>	bpalmer: thanks. duh. still a blank modeline though
Feb 21 02:46:29 <incal>	it was "Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days". I got it from another kid, I remember asking him if it was really possible to learn it in 21 days, and he replied, "Yes, if you already know it" :D
Feb 21 02:46:50 <causative>	wow I had that book
Feb 21 02:47:28 <bpalmer>	garrett: your entire modeline is blank, or just the part that you expect this to show?
Feb 21 02:47:48 <bpalmer>	oh, wow, you really did clear everything.
Feb 21 02:47:56 <incal>	causative, yeah, probably was a best-seller
Feb 21 02:48:24 <garrett>	yes
Feb 21 02:48:35 <garrett>	trying to build from scratch and also just messing around
Feb 21 02:48:53 <johnjaye>	twb: what is the T-11 thing in your modeline?
Feb 21 02:48:57 <bpalmer>	garrett: it may be easier to test with the function format-mode-line ; you give it a list just like mode-line-format and it returns a string
Feb 21 02:49:23 <twb>	Hm?
Feb 21 02:49:44 <garrett>	these names are so awesome. thanks bpalmer
Feb 21 02:49:48 <twb>	I don't see a "T-11"
Feb 21 02:49:48 <johnjaye>	the screenshot of python taking up the whole screen
Feb 21 02:49:57 <twb>	Oh, you mean on the screen hardline
Feb 21 02:50:10 <johnjaye>	i thought it was emacs modeline in terminal
Feb 21 02:50:27 <twb>	That's "2024-02-21T12:50:19+11:00" truncated because I have too many tabs open
Feb 21 02:50:40 <twb>	And right of that is the loadavg
Feb 21 02:51:02 <johnjaye>	oh  yeah i need to use the emacs tab feature
Feb 21 02:51:07 <johnjaye>	i've gotten so used to using tmux though
Feb 21 02:51:09 <twb>	Then hostname (useful when nesting several screens), then IRC channels, then battery charge and time-to-empty/full
Feb 21 02:52:19 <johnjaye>	what's the .56 .53 .54
Feb 21 02:52:30 <jvml>	 i'm wanting to code a client for https://hostb.org in elisp sometime
Feb 21 02:52:36 <jvml>	very nice website
Feb 21 02:54:27 <bpalmer>	garrett: so, mode-line-format is a bit of an annoying format, but as an example: (defun foo () 7) and then later (format-mode-line '((:eval (format "%d" (foo))))) => "7"
Feb 21 02:56:24 <incal>	jvml, there seems to be a Python CLI client, https://hostb.org/api
Feb 21 02:56:25 <bpalmer>	so you might want something like (format-mode-line '(mark-active (:eval (format "%d" (count-words-region (region-beginning) (region-end))))))
Feb 21 02:57:09 <jvml>	incal: i just thought it would be a fun exercise to make something i could run interactively in emacs to upload to hostb since i use it so much
Feb 21 02:57:19 <jvml>	a good learning experience too
Feb 21 02:57:54 <incal>	I think that is pretty advanced actually but don't let that stop you
Feb 21 02:58:23 <jvml>	yeah ik i would have to build up to it
Feb 21 02:58:44 <twb>	johnjaye: 12:50 <twb> And right of that is the loadavg
Feb 21 02:58:53 <incal>	are you using hostb_client now?
Feb 21 02:58:58 <jvml>	there's already a few similar clients for other services on melpa which i guess i could reference
Feb 21 02:59:05 <jvml>	nah i usually upload from the website
Feb 21 02:59:09 <garrett>	i'll give it a whirl thanks
Feb 21 02:59:58 <johnjaye>	twb: what's the easiest way to get something like that into the modeline?
Feb 21 03:00:10 <johnjaye>	i'm looking at mode-line-format and it's mostly codes like %e or %b
Feb 21 03:00:11 <twb>	https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=loadavg
Feb 21 03:00:16 <twb>	johnjaye: no idea
Feb 21 03:00:37 <twb>	johnjaye: there's a couple of existing global minor modes for that sort of thing, else you can do it by hand
Feb 21 03:01:03 <twb>	timeclock-mode-line-display
Feb 21 03:01:31 <incal>	I don't know if it is easy but you can use `setq-default' to set `mode-line-format' to whatever, embed with :eval to execute arbitrary Elisp
Feb 21 03:01:57 <incal>	e.g., I've done it here: https://dataswamp.org/~incal/emacs-init/mode-line.el - but I don't know if I really recommend anyone to do it
Feb 21 03:02:15 <twb>	johnjaye: battery-mode-line-string
Feb 21 03:02:41 <incal>	lines 35-59
Feb 21 03:03:09 <johnjaye>	if i put something like shell-command-to-string then it might execute it too much.
Feb 21 03:03:12 <twb>	Oh I think timeclock is actually "how long have I spent on task X", and the actual clock time is in display-time-mode
Feb 21 03:03:23 <twb>	I can't immediately see one for loadavg
Feb 21 03:05:00 <johnjaye>	twb: is that a code string for mode-line-format only?
Feb 21 03:05:17 <twb>	(defun get-loadavg () (save-excursion (find-file "/proc/loadvg") (buffer-contents)))
Feb 21 03:05:36 <twb>	(add-to-list global-mode-string #'get-loadavg)
Feb 21 03:05:45 <twb>	johnjaye: it'd be something along those lines
Feb 21 03:06:30 <twb>	Not sure offhand if it accepts funtions or if those need to be variables that you update somewhere else
Feb 21 03:06:56 <johnjaye>	weirdly buffer-contents is the only one of those things that is not in my path
Feb 21 03:07:36 <johnjaye>	shouldnt it be buffer-string
Feb 21 03:07:42 <johnjaye>	or like buffer-string-no-properties
Feb 21 03:08:04 <johnjaye>	but i guess i'm just nitpicking now. thanks
Feb 21 03:08:14 <twb>	whatever
Feb 21 03:08:24 <twb>	You can have properties in it
Feb 21 03:09:06 <twb>	johnjaye: https://paste.rs/DLEI5  I guess because the modeline is clickable and clicking does something "useful"
Feb 21 03:24:09 <johnjaye>	right
Feb 21 03:25:08 <johnjaye>	hmm. i wonder if you could make a book searchable with a word cloud or something.
Feb 21 03:25:28 <johnjaye>	org-mode might be able to do this. you mark individual paragraphs with word tags. then use fuzzy search to find matches to queries
Feb 21 03:25:37 <johnjaye>	basically a super index
Feb 21 03:26:07 <jvml>	i'm convinced org-mode can do just about anything
Feb 21 03:26:40 <johnjaye>	i guess you could just as easly have a json file. number pages 1 to 1000 or something and each number gets an array of tags. then use some sql/jq/web ninjutsu
Feb 21 03:27:16 <jvml>	i bet corpus analysis software might be helpful in this regard
Feb 21 03:27:25 <johnjaye>	what is that
Feb 21 03:27:59 <johnjaye>	all my google results are not very informative
Feb 21 03:28:11 <jvml>	nvm i was thinking of something else i don't know the name of
Feb 21 03:28:12 <jvml>	my bad
Feb 21 03:29:34 <jvml>	oh, i was thinking of a concordance or something like that
Feb 21 03:34:40 <incal>	ninjutsu, haha. Turtles!
Feb 21 03:34:56 <incal>	cowabunga!
Feb 21 03:36:46 <incal>	but only one Turtles movie is good IMO, TMNT by Kevin Munroe from 2007
Feb 21 03:37:23 <jvml>	my siblings both enjoy the most recent TMNT series a fair bit
Feb 21 03:37:29 <incal>	with April doing iaido in pretty curvy CGI
Feb 21 03:38:13 <incal>	I heard of a recent movie that was supposedly "back-to-kids" TMNT, didn't see it yet
Feb 21 03:38:32 <johnjaye>	closest tmnt to the comics was the 2003 version
Feb 21 03:38:55 <incal>	it is "Mutant Mayhem" from 2023
Feb 21 03:40:39 <incal>	here was a sequel to TMNT (2014) called "Out of the Shadows" (2016), let's see if I can find that
Feb 21 03:41:08 <incal>	I don't like the hybrid movies they make with a lot of people (real people), I like it all cartoon or all CGI
Feb 21 03:41:25 <jvml>	2d animation in general is really really nice
Feb 21 03:41:39 <incal>	indeed
Feb 21 03:41:40 <jvml>	not western animation but Shaft really shows the full potential of digital 2d in their anime works
Feb 21 03:41:45 <jvml>	love Shaft
Feb 21 03:42:08 <jvml>	everything they work on is beautiful in a very distinctly sleek and modern way
Feb 21 03:42:12 <johnjaye>	wikipedia calls them "avant-garde"
Feb 21 03:42:41 <jvml>	a description i'd consider apt!
Feb 21 03:43:14 <jvml>	if you wanna watch something visually stunning i'd absolutely recommend madoka even though everyone and their cousin seems to have seen that one where i usually hang out
Feb 21 03:43:19 <incal>	but there is good animation in the west as well, e.g. quite recently "Another Day of Life" which is a documentary about Richard Kapuściński. from 2018
Feb 21 03:43:30 <johnjaye>	everything is a -gatari or a -madoka
Feb 21 03:43:56 <jvml>	sayonara zetsubou sensei is also hilarious in a way nothing else is
Feb 21 03:44:09 <jvml>	that was the first Shaft production where they really became Shaft
Feb 21 03:44:43 <incal>	Neon Genesis Evangelion and Berserk
Feb 21 03:45:05 <jvml>	NGE is timeless
Feb 21 03:45:22 <jvml>	so is Revolutionary Girl Utena imo, that's prolly the best anime ever made
Feb 21 03:45:28 <jvml>	at least in my humble opinion...
Feb 21 03:45:35 <incal>	but I like manga more as then I consume the material in a more pleasant way, compared to anime
Feb 21 03:46:03 <incal>	one also sees this when one reads manga that isn't 100% up one's alley, it is still pleasant to read but horrible to watch as an anime
Feb 21 03:46:24 <jvml>	that's very fair! the activity of interpretation is a lot more self-directed when you're reading at your own pace instead of watching along with something
Feb 21 03:46:37 <jvml>	i appreciate curling up with a good manga from time to time as well
Feb 21 03:46:41 <incal>	yeah I think that is the explanation
Feb 21 03:47:34 <jvml>	i recall dororo being a fun manga to read, i got the full english volume from a Barnes & Noble at some point but stopped around halfway through it a while back
Feb 21 03:47:41 <jvml>	have mostly watched anime since then unfortunately
Feb 21 03:48:13 <incal>	I get all the manga from the public library so can't be too picky but they have a pretty big collection by now
Feb 21 03:48:35 <johnjaye>	NGE was made by gainax not shaft?
Feb 21 03:48:40 <jvml>	yeah it was
Feb 21 03:48:56 <jvml>	gainax had a very unique feel to their work around that time as well though
Feb 21 03:50:26 <johnjaye>	my public library has berserk, tokyo ghoul, and a random collection of marvel dc and other comics. it's like 2 shelves.
Feb 21 03:50:28 <incal>	the TV show was 26 episodes 1995-1996
Feb 21 03:50:56 <incal>	yeah, I enjoy Marvel as well. X-Men and Conan
Feb 21 03:51:08 <jvml>	my closest libraries are all my university stuff, so i tend to get non-graphic novel stuff from there most of the time
Feb 21 03:51:23 <jvml>	a very rich selection of so-called """serious""" literature though
Feb 21 03:52:41 <incal>	here is the 2016 Turtles movie, https://ytssss.jamsbase.com/movies/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-out-of-the-shadows-2016
Feb 21 03:53:47 <jvml>	brilliant!
Feb 21 03:55:50 <jvml>	 most recent things i picked up from the library were an edition of tacitus (for a course), a sumerian grammar, and a book of sumerian poetry in translation
Feb 21 03:59:00 <incal>	see if they have som Etruscan poetry next time

Feb 21 04:59:53 <bpalmer>	Let's calculate the decade at which popular music peaked in quality.
Feb 21 05:01:36 <incal>	count the number of bits that changed value in the production process maybe
Feb 21 05:01:57 <bpalmer>	analog music never has to worry about bit flips
Feb 21 05:02:19 <incal>	well, you can't count the number of strings being pulled
Feb 21 05:04:06 <incal>	you can use the hit lists to get a list of the 1000 most popular songs for each decade, then use YouTube views to find out what decade is the most popular
Feb 21 05:04:57 <incal>	in a way, that would favor the past, right? but in practice I think it will favor the present big time
Feb 21 05:04:59 <bpalmer>	the more people that watch something, the more we can conclude the quality is average.
Feb 21 05:05:40 <incal>	maybe the quality of popular music how popular it is
Feb 21 05:07:08 <incal>	the quality of a piece of textile is TPI, threads per inch. not sure if music has a definition

In a description of a new "University of Austin" ( https://web.archive.org/web/20240219233718/https://thenewinquiry.com/an-american-education-notes-from-uatx/ ) summer program of "Forbidden Courses", almost every participant turned out to be a computer science student.
Feb 21 08:31:45 <bpalmer>	but a diverse background! "Some people studied business, too."
Feb 21 08:32:35 <danza>	wonder whether they are hackers so interested in what is forbidden ... what would "forbidden courses" mean?
Feb 21 08:34:42 <bpalmer>	(the university is basically bankrolled by a bunch of prominent US conservatives who 'saw a void in American higher ed. There was not, they asserted, enough free speech. Where, they wondered, was the pursuit of truth? Nowadays, those things were hard to find, but they would be abundant at UATX')
Feb 21 08:36:44 <bpalmer>	so "forbidden courses" would be "the courses not allowed at all those liberal institutions" or something.
Feb 21 08:37:16 <twb>	Is it possible to do a "spinner" in HTML+CSS, no images or SVG at all?
Feb 21 08:38:00 <danza>	strange people in political sciences or humanities would not be interested
Feb 21 08:38:05 <twb>	I want basically the moral equivalent of lofi printf("\r%c", "/-|-"[i % 4]);
Feb 21 08:38:21 <bpalmer>	twb: sure. https://loading.io/css/
Feb 21 08:38:34 <danza>	twb, either an image or svg i guess
Feb 21 08:38:55 <twb>	danza: I specifically said *without* an image or SVG
Feb 21 08:40:23 <twb>	Well that page sure uses a lot of CPU
Feb 21 08:40:29 <twb>	But otherwise, nice
Feb 21 08:40:39 <bpalmer>	https://github.com/loadingio/css-spinner/tree/master/dist/entries/heart to see it in .css and .html files working together without the compilation needed
Feb 21 08:40:46 <danza>	yeah but i did not think it was possible, bpalmer proved me wrong. I think they use basic character symbols and animate that
Feb 21 08:42:16 <bpalmer>	Oh, I didn't think to just click on one of the spinners to see the CSS
Feb 21 08:44:09 <danza>	anyways morally i would say that SVG and images are fine, as they belong to a web document as much as a char belongs to printf
Feb 21 08:44:59 <danza>	an SVG is even just XML
Feb 21 08:51:27 <bpalmer>	*just* xml? Is it time again for simple monoids in the category of endofunctors?
Feb 21 08:57:07 <bkhl>	I mean it is just a tree graph really.
Feb 21 09:01:51 <bpalmer>	rudybot: some say that macbeth shall never be vanquished until great birnarm wood to high dunsinane hill shall come against him.
Feb 21 09:01:51 <rudybot>	bpalmer: there's a reason poor macbeth was scared of dunsinane
Feb 21 09:02:19 <bpalmer>	trees are quite formidable in the right circumstances.
Feb 21 09:03:55 <bpalmer>	judybot: six percent of Americans think they could beat a grizzly bear in hand to hand combat; the number who think they can defeat an oak tree in similar circumstances is
Feb 21 09:03:58 <judybot>	bpalmer: a mere four percent. The point is that we are a nation of cowards, and that our cowardice has a lot to do with the way we treat animals.
Feb 21 09:06:51 <twb>	bpalmer: well duh, bears don't have HANDS, they have PAWS
Feb 21 09:07:24 <twb>	That's clearly just the 6% of americans who at any given point of time aren't either eating a hoagie or masturbating, thereby rendering their hands unavailable
Feb 21 09:07:40 <bkhl>	There is no special word for bear hands in English?
Feb 21 09:07:42 <twb>	Is "hoagie" a dialect word?
Feb 21 09:08:01 <twb>	bkhl: as opposed to e.g. echidna paws?
Feb 21 09:08:21 <bkhl>	I'm just surprised, I would maybe even have accidentally assumed it's the same as in Swedish and called them "rams"
Feb 21 09:09:08 <twb>	Etymology 2 From Old Swedish ramber, Old Norse hrammr (“bear's claw; paw”).  Noun ram c a front paw of a bear (figuratively) a large hand
Feb 21 09:09:10 <twb>	Interesting
Feb 21 09:09:56 <bpalmer>	bkhl: what's the Swedish name for male bighorn sheep (In English, "rams") ?
Feb 21 09:10:15 <bkhl>	bagge
Feb 21 09:11:22 <bkhl>	bagge also can mean a lump or something and is in various dialect names for root vegetables.
Feb 21 09:11:22 <twb>	"Mama, die, die, die!"
Feb 21 09:11:44 <bkhl>	Thus the word "rotabagge" which has been loaned into American English as "rutabaga".
Feb 21 09:13:05 <bkhl>	"bagge" is also a derogatory term for Norwegians. :-)
Feb 21 09:14:06 <twb>	I wish duolingo had swears in it
Feb 21 09:14:50 <twb>	The funniest thing in it so far is when going es→en, all the early sentences are like "I wash dishes in a restaraunt"
Feb 21 09:15:20 <twb>	Whereas for most other languages the sentences are more like "I want beer/coffee/milk/bread"
Feb 21 09:16:05 <twb>	es→ru mentions T/V distinction immediately, whereas en→ru doesn't for aaaaages
Feb 21 09:16:32 <twb>	(The Russians stole it from the French ~250 years ago, when they were on a gentrification bender)
Feb 21 09:59:56 <Viking667>	aieeeeee.......oh. I'm here already.
Feb 21 10:05:43 <jbe>	huzzah
Feb 21 10:05:48 <edgar-rft>	no, you're there
Feb 21 10:09:11 <Viking667>	It's taken a while, and I'm on slow wireless (as I said 24-ish hours ago). Not much of a problem for IRC, but definitely slows down youtube and downloads.
Feb 21 10:15:50 <Viking667>	First of Feb, got rung up (we'd _literally_ just moved in the day before) and told that someone would be there to install fibre. They came, but couldn't push the fibre through the conduit from the cabinet to the house, but they didn't know why. I had to wait over two weeks longer before THAT got sorted.
Feb 21 10:16:41 <Viking667>	 Then the room that has the computers has one set of double plugs, and I needed to wait until yesterday to get the rest of the powerplugs we needed just so I could bring up my computer. Sigh. Now I need to have an ethernet connection from one side of the room over to the other side of the room. THEN I'll have full speed (100mbit) access.
Feb 21 10:16:43 <danse-nr3>	moving to a new house i think i would not install cable internet, being working with mobile since ages
Feb 21 10:17:27 <Viking667>	Not only that, this isn't a new house. It's as old as the year it was born. (of course,  subtract 1900 from the year)
Feb 21 10:18:46 <twb>	Viking667: yt-dlp --format=worst is usually, like, WAP thumbnail videos
Feb 21 10:19:15 <Viking667>	Here at least, mobile is still a bit patchy, and fibre is just the bee's knees. It's consistent (except powerouts, but I don't expect too many platforms to cope with that) and as fast as you're prepared to pay for.
Feb 21 10:20:24 <Viking667>	heh. I'm getting 480p consistently, not sure I'm willing to push for 720p (my normal selection for 100mbit). I had 20mbit down, 6 mbit up when I ran speedtest.
Feb 21 10:21:08 <twb>	OK apparently yt-dlp and/or youtube has changed
Feb 21 10:21:51 <twb>	Because now --format=worst is like 33kB/s where it used to be much smaller.
Feb 21 10:22:49 <Viking667>	If I'm prepared to wait, I do get 303+251 down in passable time, dependent upon video length.
Feb 21 10:24:08 <twb>	$ map with-temp-dir yt-dlp pYW2ZUsoofA -- --format=worst{,video,audio} → 6.96MiB (combined) vs 1.37MiB (545.72KiB + 819.43KiB)
Feb 21 10:24:54 <twb>	I have ytdl-format=best[tbr<1M] in ~/.config/mpv/config because worst *was* annoyingly small and the default was annoyingly big
Feb 21 10:25:22 <Viking667>	besttbr  ? never heard of that.
Feb 21 10:27:03 <twb>	It's basically saying "do the best you can WITHOUT exceeding 1MB/s"
Feb 21 10:27:15 <twb>	Although if nothing will match, it'll still go over
Feb 21 10:28:13 <Viking667>	Ah huh.
Feb 21 10:28:52 <Viking667>	Incidentaly, what's Mb vs MB? I can never get my head around which one is bits per second or bytes per second.

Feb 21 10:31:34 <twb>	Also, you have to worry about whether it's SI units (base 10, 1000) or IEC units (base 2, 1024), or in some cases a mix of the two
Feb 21 10:32:27 <twb>	For example SSDs are sold as "2TB†  †1TB = 1000×1024×1024×1024"
Feb 21 10:33:19 <twb>	I generally write "MiB" and "Mbit" for clarity, or full longhand if I need to be *really* clear.
Feb 21 10:33:40 <Viking667>	Yah. I even hit that (the TB thing) in later PATA drives and some SATA drives too.
Feb 21 10:35:08 <twb>	HDDs use SI units throughout
Feb 21 10:35:09 <Viking667>	...and as I've been working with drives since MFM 20mb drives were a thing, I've been in the game a while.
Feb 21 10:35:17 <Viking667>	oh, NOW they do, yes.

Feb 21 10:38:59 <Viking667>	ah huh.
Feb 21 10:55:42 <Viking667>	Anyhow, I'm off for tonight.
Feb 21 11:28:55 <arch-angel>	ever since I switched from company-mode over to corfu, the autocompletion suggestions doesn't show up, I have to manually call completion-at-point for it to show up
Feb 21 11:28:59 <arch-angel>	why does that happen?
Feb 21 11:38:51 <habamax>	arch-angel, did you turn on autocompletion?
Feb 21 11:39:28 <habamax>	https://github.com/minad/corfu?tab=readme-ov-file#auto-completion
Feb 21 11:46:38 <arch-angel>	habamax, wdym autocompletion?
Feb 21 11:46:56 <arch-angel>	isn't autocompletion like completing it automatically?
Feb 21 11:47:02 <habamax>	when window with completions auto pop up
Feb 21 11:47:11 <arch-angel>	thats called autocompletion?
Feb 21 11:47:28 <habamax>	corfu calls it autocompletion
Feb 21 11:47:33 <arch-angel>	man I did not know that
Feb 21 11:47:35 <habamax>	did you check its docs
Feb 21 11:47:38 <arch-angel>	let me try
Feb 21 12:05:02 <twb>	Is there a way to get handlebars to URL-escape a string?
Feb 21 12:05:57 <twb>	So like if I have {'url': 'https://example.com'} I want to be able to say <a href="/blame?sender={{url}}">
Feb 21 12:06:15 <twb>	Which I think means converting / to %2F and suchlike
Feb 21 12:07:11 <twb>	maybe I don't actually need that, and the problem is elsewhere...
Feb 21 12:07:59 <twb>	Yeah, I think the actual problem is either in fastapi or htmx, since <a href=> works whre <button hx-delete=> is being weird
Feb 21 12:10:12 <twb>	Aha.  It's fastapi assuming the empty string means None rather than the empty string.
Feb 21 12:10:28 <twb>	(I'm trying to work with a legacy database as-is, so the schema is mental)
Feb 21 12:18:56 <danisanti>	is there a function to sleep, without idling GNU Emacs? I have notice that sit-for does not idle, but it also stops the sleep when I do any action in Emacs.
Feb 21 12:20:50 <danisanti>	I don't want the sleep time to get interrupted, as it seems to happen with sit-for.
Feb 21 12:31:33 <dminuoso>	What does "idling" mean to you, exactly?
Feb 21 12:32:05 <danisanti>	dminuoso: it means that the whole Emacs gets unresponsive.
Feb 21 12:32:44 <dminuoso>	What does "sleeping" mean to you, exactly?
Feb 21 12:32:53 <dminuoso>	Do you perhaps mean to use https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Timers.html ?
Feb 21 12:33:45 <danisanti>	dminuoso: for example, with (sleep-for 10) I have to wait 10 seconds until I can do the things I was doing in Emacs. I want the function to wait 10 seconds until the next expression, and I want to be able to work with Emacs in the meanwhile
Feb 21 12:36:06 <dminuoso>	danisanti: Use timers
Feb 21 12:36:12 <danisanti>	dminuoso: yes, that seems to be what I need. One more question...
Feb 21 12:37:34 <danisanti>	if I want to set a sleep timer in a middle of a function, I need to set the below expression of the sleep inside the timer?
Feb 21 12:37:51 <twb>	FWIW I didn't understand the explanation, either.
Feb 21 12:38:09 <danisanti>	by below expression, I mean all the expressions below the sleep.
Feb 21 12:38:21 <twb>	danisanti: well you could just block the entire emacs process
Feb 21 12:38:36 <twb>	There's bound to be a generic "do nothing for 5 seconds" function
Feb 21 12:38:48 <danisanti>	twb: how can that be done?
Feb 21 12:39:05 <twb>	(sleep-for 5) I guess
Feb 21 12:39:15 <danisanti>	twb: that is not what I want
Feb 21 12:39:31 <danisanti>	I don't want to block Emacs in the meanwhile
Feb 21 12:39:33 <twb>	Then I guess you have to use a continuation
Feb 21 12:40:02 <danisanti>	twb: yeah, something like that. How can I set up a continuation in Elisp?
Feb 21 12:40:24 <twb>	write it by hand?
Feb 21 12:40:33 <danisanti>	hook?
Feb 21 12:40:34 <fsbot>	[->] Hooks are [0] (info "(emacs)Hooks") ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Feb 21 12:40:39 <danisanti>	ok
Feb 21 12:41:01 <bremner>	write your functions to take an extra argument which is the closure representing a continuation
Feb 21 12:41:11 <bremner>	it won't work so well with the rest of emacs, I guess
Feb 21 12:41:44 <twb>	(defun f () (message "fuck..." (run-at-time "1 min" (lambda () (message "...a duck"))))) ?
Feb 21 12:44:46 <danisanti>	thanks twb and bremner. Now.... I think I already asked this in this channel... if I am receiving a response from a server, and I want to wait for the response to arrive, or wait 10 seconds without idling Emacs (and without stopping the idling, like sit-for unfortunately does) how can this be done? run-at-time?
Feb 21 12:47:29 <danisanti>	yes, I have tried and seems like run-at-time is the way to go.
Feb 21 12:52:06 <danisanti>	run-at-time inside the function makes it return the timer-closure function. It there a way to get the value of the timer-closure function, inside the run-at-time function?
Feb 21 12:59:12 <danisanti>	I think I will write my own network locking until message is received.
Feb 21 13:01:12 <danisanti>	timer does not let the function, return the value of the timed function.
Feb 21 13:03:47 <ski>	looks like the result of calling the function is not saved (judging from `timer-el')
Feb 21 13:04:51 <ski>	i guess you could probably do a wrapper which saves the result, and then later lets you check if it's run yet, getting that result
Feb 21 13:15:08 <danisanti>	ski: a wrapper with a global variable?
Feb 21 13:22:11 <ski>	danisanti : no, using local lexical scope
Feb 21 13:24:24 <kompowiec2>	hi, i work a lot with org mode and I noticed that sometimes I get a bug i guess because I have many first row lines (with one *) collapsed and while I'm working, one of them doesn't want to open and the SUBTREE (CHILDREN) message appears and only resetting emacs helps. Does anyone understand what this means?
Feb 21 13:25:26 <danisanti>	ski: can you point me to some solutions?
Feb 21 13:42:47 <lechner>	Hi, in paredit-mode is there a way to enter Guile's single-character literals, which look like \#X, without turning off the mode? Thanks!   https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Characters.html
Feb 21 13:44:17 <graywolf>	Is it possible to use outline-minor-mode with multiline outline-regexp?  When I fold, it uses the first line of the match as the heading, while I would like to use the second one...
Feb 21 13:44:38 <graywolf>	lechner: Doesn't just typing \#f result in \#f in the buffer?
Feb 21 13:45:55 <lechner>	graywolf / you are right! i must have gotten confused with another backslash that tripped up paredit
Feb 21 14:00:05 <arch-angel>	Why whenever I start eglot I get "Warning (emacs): ‘:events-buffer-scrollback-size’ deprecated. Use ‘events-buffer-config’."
Feb 21 14:02:34 <Odin-LAP>	Maybe you need to update eglot?
Feb 21 14:04:23 <arch-angel>	Odin-LAP, I checked, nothing needs updating?
Feb 21 14:04:37 <arch-angel>	I searched this warning through google, and apparently its some very recent error
Feb 21 14:06:14 <arch-angel>	it has been raised here https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/7606
Feb 21 14:06:24 <Odin-LAP>	arch-angel: Are you using bleeding edge emacs?
Feb 21 14:06:45 <arch-angel>	Odin-LAP, I compiled my emacs with the emacs-29.2 tarball
Feb 21 14:07:31 <Odin-LAP>	Are you using the built-in eglot?
Feb 21 14:08:07 <arch-angel>	yes
Feb 21 14:09:35 <APic>	Hi
Feb 21 14:09:37 <APic>	,BotSnack
Feb 21 14:09:38 <fsbot>	yay!
Feb 21 14:10:08 <Odin-LAP>	arch-angel: That's weird, because eglot was changed to use the new version in the same commit as the deprecation happened.
Feb 21 14:10:51 <Odin-LAP>	arch-angel: So I'd double check that you aren't loading eglot from an older package.
Feb 21 14:10:58 <arch-angel>	how do I check?
Feb 21 14:14:05 <Odin-LAP>	arch-angel: Unless you installed it manually, you should be able to find it in the packages list.
Feb 21 14:14:51 <arch-angel>	says here 1.17
Feb 21 14:15:33 <arch-angel>	says here built-in 1.12.29
Feb 21 14:15:43 <arch-angel>	thats awfully outdated
Feb 21 14:16:13 <arch-angel>	oh yeah problem fixed
Feb 21 14:16:24 <arch-angel>	I installed the 1.17 version, apparently it's not installed
Feb 21 14:16:59 <Odin-LAP>	Hm.
Feb 21 14:17:11 <Odin-LAP>	arch-angel: What about the jsonrpc package?
Feb 21 14:18:08 <Odin-LAP>	arch-angel: If you had an updated version of that, but not eglot, that might have been the cause.
Feb 21 14:18:19 <arch-angel>	Odin-LAP, says here, dependency 1.0.24, built-in 1.0.16
Feb 21 14:19:53 <Odin-LAP>	arch-angel: Yes, but that may have changed after you updated eglot. It doesn't really matter, I was just wondering about possible causes.
Feb 21 14:24:16 <arch-angel>	i see
Feb 21 14:24:20 <arch-angel>	thanks for your help
Feb 21 14:36:13 <Hawkeseh>	Hey! Can you see this? I'm just testing out ERC.
Feb 21 14:37:32 <Hawkeseh>	I guess not.
Feb 21 14:37:59 <Odin-LAP>	There may be many minutes where nobody speaks here.
Feb 21 14:38:01 <kiliro>	how can I open the log for the erc buffer I am on?
Feb 21 14:38:27 <kiliro>	without searching for it....
Feb 21 14:38:33 <kiliro>	with find-file
Feb 21 14:38:44 <Hawkeseh>	So you could see my messages? @Odin-LAP
Feb 21 14:39:12 <Odin-LAP>	Hawkeseh: Yes.
Feb 21 14:39:48 <Hawkeseh>	Thanks for responding. I'm new to ERC, have only ever used mIRC before.
Feb 21 14:40:25 <e1f>	kiliro: did you enable logging?
Feb 21 14:40:58 <kiliro>	yes
Feb 21 14:41:55 <kiliro>	you gave us less than a minute to respond, Hawkeseh
Feb 21 14:42:32 <kiliro>	I did enable logging in erc
Feb 21 14:42:51 <kiliro>	but I have to search for the log file with find-file
Feb 21 14:43:25 <kiliro>	the buffer I am on gives a hint about which file I want...LOL
Feb 21 14:44:34 <kiliro>	I want to search for a text in the contents of the logs also because they make many names....
Feb 21 14:44:58 <kiliro>	Hawkeseh: you can also ping fsbot
Feb 21 14:45:01 <kiliro>	.ping
Feb 21 14:45:09 <kiliro>	,ping
Feb 21 14:45:10 <fsbot>	␕
Feb 21 14:45:16 <kiliro>	there it is
Feb 21 14:45:47 <kiliro>	I used m-x grep
Feb 21 14:45:56 <kiliro>	I used M-x grep
Feb 21 14:46:17 <kiliro>	but it did not give me the output that I expected
Feb 21 14:46:18 <grym>	,pong
Feb 21 14:46:19 <fsbot>	🏓
Feb 21 14:46:46 <Hawkeseh>	All right. Guess I'm out of step with this whole thing at this point. Just trying to figure out if things are working as they should or not. =)
Feb 21 14:46:55 <kiliro>	I guess that it only works on the names of the files in the current directory, and not on their contents
Feb 21 14:47:12 <kiliro>	are they, Hawkeseh ?
Feb 21 14:47:44 <kiliro>	Hawkeseh: why do you think that you are out of step?
Feb 21 14:47:57 <kiliro>	you are learning, as we all are
Feb 21 14:48:05 <kiliro>	just at different levels
Feb 21 14:54:52 <Hawkeseh>	Well. Let's just say I used to be pretty down with IRC but that was a while back and now I kinda feel.. "Not very pro" So to speak. Not that it matters. But it doesn't really help all that much trying to use it via Emacs ERC for the first time. :P
Feb 21 14:55:56 <kiliro>	Hawkeseh: what is the problem?  maybe we can help
Feb 21 14:56:15 <kiliro>	Hawkeseh: what do you need, that you do not have?
Feb 21 14:57:04 <kiliro>	just use the tab key to guess the nicks
Feb 21 14:57:37 <kiliro>	or mention the nicks of the bots present and fiddle around with them
Feb 21 14:57:48 <corwin>	Hawkeseh: ERC is the more complicated IRC client for Emacs; rcirc is much less work to configure (although it has fewer customization knobs)
Feb 21 14:57:56 <kiliro>	fsbot or judybot
Feb 21 14:57:56 <fsbot>	judybot  ..(symbol)
Feb 21 14:58:23 <kiliro>	I started with erc
Feb 21 14:58:29 <kiliro>	I never learned rcirc
Feb 21 14:58:35 <kiliro>	hi, corwin
Feb 21 14:59:03 <kiliro>	the harder it is, the more you learn...but you have to be more persistent
Feb 21 14:59:16 <Hawkeseh>	I don't require any help at all thank you. I may ask for some in the future but for now I'll happily try to figure stuff out on my own. =) I'll just be idling for a bit.
Feb 21 14:59:19 <kiliro>	but the more you learn, the faster you do it
Feb 21 14:59:22 <grym>	,yow
Feb 21 14:59:58 <fsbot>	Just imagine you're entering a state-of-the-art CAR WASH!!
Feb 21 15:18:48 <corwin>	rudybot: later tell Viking667 welcome back! how was the move?
Feb 21 15:18:48 <rudybot>	corwin: I asked `MemoServ' to forward the message to Viking667.
Feb 21 15:20:54 <a51>	is there a package for k8s that looks like https://k9scli.io/ ? kubernetes-el is the best k8s client for emacs ?
Feb 21 15:23:44 <Demosthenex>	i'm trying to keep my lunch down...
Feb 21 15:49:12 <EdwardIII>	anyone have an example config on how to replicate vim's C-o thing where it goes back to the last thing in a buffer you were fiddling with? i've tried to replicate it a bit but i don't think i'm dropping marks in enough places
Feb 21 15:49:24 <EdwardIII>	i borrowed the idea from how doom does it with evil mode
Feb 21 15:49:36 <rpav>	EdwardIII: like C-x C-x?
Feb 21 15:49:42 <rpav>	i don't know what C-o in vim does though
Feb 21 15:50:01 <EdwardIII>	rpav kind of like C-x C-x, but with loads of jumps, and no selecting text
Feb 21 15:50:49 <grym>	EdwardIII: i've used consult-mark a little
Feb 21 15:51:00 <rpav>	EdwardIII: i think there's a mark ring; lots of things actually drop a mark; and i think there's a thing that goes back in the mark ring
Feb 21 15:51:02 <dutchie>	you can C-u C-<SPC>
Feb 21 15:51:09 <dutchie>	to do that mark ring thing rpav mentioned
Feb 21 15:51:45 <dutchie>	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Mark-Ring.html
Feb 21 15:52:04 <dutchie>	although:  C-u C-SPC always stays in the same buffer
Feb 21 15:52:09 <rpav>	C-u C-SPC is pretty dumb
Feb 21 15:52:29 <dutchie>	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Global-Mark-Ring.html
Feb 21 15:52:30 <EdwardIII>	i think the issue is... this requires dropping a manual mark right?
Feb 21 15:52:36 <rpav>	EdwardIII: naj
Feb 21 15:52:38 <rpav>	"nah"
Feb 21 15:52:42 <dutchie>	not necessarily, e.g. C-s sets a mark
Feb 21 15:52:50 <rpav>	any kind of movement etc pushes a mark (often annoyingly)
Feb 21 15:52:53 <EdwardIII>	does it now
Feb 21 15:53:17 <EdwardIII>	playing with it it actually seems to dwim a bit
Feb 21 15:53:29 <grym>	consult mark is bound to M-g m for me
Feb 21 15:53:46 <grym>	and then all the normal tricks for fast selection work there
Feb 21 15:54:02 <rpav>	the emacs manual really ought to document what keys are actually bound to, not just the key
Feb 21 15:54:28 <EdwardIII>	maybe i'll try binding C-u C-SPC to C-o and see if it just works for me
Feb 21 15:54:55 <EdwardIII>	consult mark is bound to M-g m for me too and that does look quite good
Feb 21 15:55:06 <EdwardIII>	although i do think i will prefer the mindless bashing of C-o
Feb 21 15:55:46 <EdwardIII>	right, i currently have: (global-set-key (kbd "C-o") 'pop-global-mark) but it just seems to send me all over the place
Feb 21 15:56:11 <grym>	i have come to strongly prefer most tools that show me what they're about to do instead of just doing it, with rare exceptions
Feb 21 15:56:32 <grym>	i am a simple man and i need visual context
Feb 21 15:56:40 <JohnGalt>	I like dry run mode
Feb 21 15:56:50 <EdwardIII>	frantic button mashing is good to me, if it's easily reversible
Feb 21 15:57:04 <EdwardIII>	C-o goes back, C-i goes forwards (in vim)
Feb 21 15:57:38 <grym>	EdwardIII: i actually like the mouse-thumb-buttons-navigate-the-stack UX that's long been common on browsers
Feb 21 15:58:22 <EdwardIII>	pop-global-mark doesn't seem to take me back through marks in the current file, it just seems to jump back to the last file first if you see what i mean?
Feb 21 15:59:16 <kiliro>	it exchanges mark and point
Feb 21 16:00:34 <kiliro>	there is org-mark-ring-goto and org-mark-ring-push
Feb 21 16:01:05 <kiliro>	when I type C-h a mark ring <RET>
Feb 21 16:03:29 <kiliro>	Jump to the previous position in the mark ring.  With prefix arg N, jump back that many stored positions.  When called several times in succession, walk through the entire ring.  Org mode commands jumping to a different position in the current file, or to another Org file, automatically push the old position onto the ring.
Feb 21 16:03:34 <EdwardIII>	hmm C-h k C-u C-SPC doesn't seem to work heh, it cuts in at C-u and points to universal-argument which kind of makes sense
Feb 21 16:04:01 <kiliro>	C-u will not work with C-h k
Feb 21 16:04:02 <EdwardIII>	hmm kiliro that does sound a bit more like what i want
Feb 21 16:04:37 <kiliro>	I do not know if it works outside of org-mode
Feb 21 16:04:42 <EdwardIII>	looks like no
Feb 21 16:08:18 <JohnGalt>	you could write your own, add something to the change hook and memorize the location on a ring of locations
Feb 21 16:08:37 <EdwardIII>	or just a function that just keeps popping, and when there are no more pops, looks to the global buffer?
Feb 21 16:13:08 <kiliro>	pop is exchange point (where you are now) with mark, where you marked
Feb 21 16:13:33 <kiliro>	when you pop twice, you return to the previous state
Feb 21 16:13:56 <kiliro>	what you want is to walk through the mark ring
Feb 21 16:15:10 <EdwardIII>	hmm right
Feb 21 16:16:49 <EdwardIII>	i think evil must already have implemented this though: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/blob/5995f6f21f662484440ed67a28ce59e365feb9ad/evil-maps.el#L295
Feb 21 16:17:45 <kiliro>	maybe I am wrong...but that is how I understood it
Feb 21 16:18:11 <EdwardIII>	but like am i thinking about this the wrong way? is there a more emacsy way of doing this within existing stuff?
Feb 21 16:20:22 <kiliro>	on which major mode, EdwardIII ?
Feb 21 16:21:12 <EdwardIII>	kiliro any and all
Feb 21 16:21:15 <zanoh>	Hi
Feb 21 16:21:48 <EdwardIII>	looks like you have to go pretty deep in the evil src until you hit bedrock, i was hoping i'd look here and see some poppery i could copy & paste heh: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/blob/5995f6f21f662484440ed67a28ce59e365feb9ad/evil-jumps.el#L244
Feb 21 16:22:18 <zanoh>	What a funny thing, EdwardIII, becuase I was having a question about evil mode myself.
Feb 21 16:22:18 <kiliro>	why don't you C-h a
Feb 21 16:22:46 <EdwardIII>	kiliro ?
Feb 21 16:25:54 <EdwardIII>	i don't understand what i'd search for? you mean maybe there is something that works like evil--jump-backwards in native emacs i can find with apropos?
Feb 21 16:26:29 <EdwardIII>	ah, https://github.com/gilbertw1/better-jumper looks interesting
Feb 21 16:30:13 <jmd>	EdwardIII: Why are you hanging around here?  You've been dead and buried for 650 years.
Feb 21 16:30:26 <EdwardIII>	jmd lot happening in the UK atm, thought they might need my help

Feb 21 17:20:45 <vifon>	Hello.  Is it just me, or is the dired-find-subdir docstring essentially inverted?  The info page <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/dired-x/Miscellaneous-Commands.html> looks correct.
Feb 21 17:21:06 <vifon>	Maybe I'm understanding "in a buffer of its own" incorrectly, but the docstring seems wrong.
Feb 21 17:36:52 <jmd>	EdwardIII: Right.  They always say that whenever a govt bill needs to pass through the Lords which doesn't quite have the numbers, Lord Lucan turns up to vote.
Feb 21 17:38:36 <EdwardIII>	jmd right i mean he was born 557 years after my death but i'll take your word for it
Feb 21 17:39:49 <grym>	and under a hill in cornwall,
Feb 21 17:42:50 <danse-nr3>	C-x e to end and run the macro at the same time is convenient
Feb 21 17:57:41 <bpalmer>	Let's gentrify the houses of lords
Feb 21 17:59:11 <bpalmer>	Huh. That's an interesting development: Apple has released a new app, "Apple Sports," that includes scores, stats, and betting odds.
Feb 21 18:00:04 <technomancy>	what's interesting about that
Feb 21 18:00:53 <bpalmer>	Sports gambling doesn't seem "mainstream" in a way that Apple would typically endorse.
Feb 21 18:02:09 <bpalmer>	it apparently doesn't support gambling itself; it only displays the odds.
Feb 21 18:15:43 <e1f>	ms id designing their own ai chips now and intel is going to fab them
Feb 21 18:21:20 <bpalmer>	 rudybot: it's an AI world now and we're all just living in it.
Feb 21 18:21:20 <rudybot>	bpalmer: and then that other (living) AI doesn't really do anything more than anyone else.
Feb 21 18:23:34 <chomwitt>	we dont live in an AI world . We live in the era of the great hype engines.
Feb 21 18:24:09 <technomancy>	we are living in a material world
Feb 21 18:24:30 <cvandusen>	spirits in a material world
Feb 21 18:27:03 <Odin-LAP>	We have gnostics here?
Feb 21 18:27:59 <enikar>	it was a nice song
Feb 21 18:28:25 <cvandusen>	Still is. ,,sting
Feb 21 18:28:26 <fsbot>	sting is Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner CBE (born 2 October 1951), known as Sting, is an English musician and actor. He was the principal songwriter, lead singer, and bassist for the new wave rock band the Police from 1977 to 1984, and launched a solo career in 1985.
Feb 21 18:28:54 <thuna`>	TIL rcirc doesn't filter out replies/mentions to ignored people (or bots) if you put a space before the name.
Feb 21 18:30:45 <thuna`>	Not sure how to feel about that.  It's intended but it feels like a bug.
Feb 21 18:32:30 <bpalmer>	thuna`: why would that be intended?
Feb 21 18:34:37 <thuna`>	bpalmer: The intended part is only filtering out messages that are clearly replies to the ignored nick.  So, for example, the message "Is rudybot down?" wouldn't be filtered, even though (for me) rudybot is ignored.  I think that makes sense.  (Although maybe a option controlling the behavior could be added [assuming it doesn't already exist].)
Feb 21 18:36:39 <bpalmer>	thuna`: I see. initial leading whitespace feels like it should be handled specially
Feb 21 18:37:30 <thuna`>	I feel like if a leading space isn't handled multiple mentions also won't be
Feb 21 18:38:08 <bpalmer>	multiple mentions like "botA: botB: you're wrong" or "botA: you shouldn't say such things, botA" ?
Feb 21 18:38:33 <thuna`>	I had "botA botB: text" in mind but yes, that too
Feb 21 18:39:05 <thuna`>	And yeah, multiple mentions aren't handled, unless I'm looking at an outdated rcirc.el
Feb 21 18:40:38 <e3d3>	where did you find the information about the space before the name ?
Feb 21 18:41:04 <thuna`>	e3d3: I saw bpalmer's message above, which had space before rudybot
Feb 21 18:41:38 <e3d3>	thuna`: thanks. I didn't saw that due to my ignore list.
Feb 21 18:42:09 <thuna`>	e3d3: Are you using rcirc with rudybot in your ignore list?
Feb 21 18:42:13 <e3d3>	yep
Feb 21 18:42:41 <thuna`>	e3d3: And you didn't see the message above? "18:21 <bpalmer>  rudybot: it's an AI world now and we're all just living in it."
Feb 21 18:43:27 <e3d3>	no, I him also in the ignore list because he talks to much to bots etc for my taste
Feb 21 18:43:35 <e3d3>	or she
Feb 21 18:43:52 <thuna`>	Ok, I see
Feb 21 18:45:00 <e3d3>	I asked because I'm not really happy with this. I prefer a smarter bullshit filter
Feb 21 18:45:22 <thuna`>	e3d3: What are you looking to filter?
Feb 21 18:45:32 <thuna`>	Or how, rather.  Regexp?
Feb 21 18:45:41 <e3d3>	still don't know
Feb 21 18:46:12 <e3d3>	I like to filter off-topic stuff
Feb 21 18:46:28 <thuna`>	I have an experimental patch adding regexp-based rcirc filters lying around somewhere.
Feb 21 18:46:38 <e3d3>	:)
Feb 21 18:46:43 <thuna`>	I don't know how you would classify a message as off-topic
Feb 21 18:46:50 <e3d3>	me neither
Feb 21 18:51:01 <technomancy>	this entire channel is off-topic
Feb 21 18:51:32 <hodapp>	your face is off-topic
Feb 21 18:51:43 <technomancy>	oh snap
Feb 21 18:51:54 <hodapp>	it literally is, so you can't get mad at me for saying that
Feb 21 18:58:45 <e3d3>	thuna`: How good does your patch works, and does it use keywords from spam filters to hide messages/ignore users ?
Feb 21 19:00:21 <thuna`>	Hmm, did that last message get sent?  I was messing with rcirc-print and didn't get it printed in my buffer
Feb 21 19:00:31 <catern>	hmm is there an easy way to do call-process-region with several non-contiguous regions? specifically I want to send an entire buffer, *skipping* a certain region
Feb 21 19:00:47 <catern>	thuna`: your last message was about classifying messages as off-topic
Feb 21 19:01:01 <thuna`>	catern: Ok, thanks
Feb 21 19:01:09 <e3d3>	thuna`: indeed, time 18:46
Feb 21 19:01:48 <thuna`>	e3d3: As it is (which is /not good/), you keep a list of regexps in some variable and if the message body matches that regexp it's ignored
Feb 21 19:02:50 <e3d3>	thuna`: do you manually add keywords ?
Feb 21 19:02:57 <thuna`>	The problem is that if you mess up the regexp a lot of (or even all) messages might be ignored, and unlike omitted messages there's no way to recover them
Feb 21 19:03:09 <thuna`>	e3d3: Yes, you need to add the regexps manually
Feb 21 19:03:26 <thuna`>	Although you could define a helper command do add them for you so you could do /ignore-phrase phrase
Feb 21 19:05:06 <e3d3>	thuna`: I don't see myself endlessly adding new president candidates, mass-media terms etc.
Feb 21 19:05:16 <bpalmer>	catern: temp buffers and copying the multiple regions into one.
Feb 21 19:06:01 <thuna`>	e3d3: Presumably you'll set the ignore list in init.el or custom.el
Feb 21 19:06:04 <catern>	bpalmer: yeah I guess that's the easiest way... slow, though, and the point of skipping here is speed, so I guess I will do it the process-send-region way
Feb 21 19:07:14 <e1f>	after the regexp is matched, how does the hiding actually happen? is the text inserted into the buffer with a hidden property or not inserted at all?
Feb 21 19:07:43 <e1f>	because if it was hidden, you could just unhide it
Feb 21 19:08:05 <e3d3>	thuna`: did you thought about dimming (instead of ignoring) unwanted message, so they are hardly but still readable
Feb 21 19:08:37 <e1f>	also, the personal logs would be incomplete
Feb 21 19:09:59 <thuna`>	e1f: Yeah, I'm specifically not printing ignored messages at all.  There's already a built-in mechanism to omit them instead so you just toggle rcirc-omit-mode to see them.  I could add an option to do that instead as well, but this was just a test run to see if I liked the list-of-regexps approach
Feb 21 19:10:33 <bpalmer>	thuna`: brave to experiment on this with your main connection
Feb 21 19:10:37 <thuna`>	e3d3: I feel like dimming doesn't help a lot
Feb 21 19:10:53 <e3d3>	thuna`: okay
Feb 21 19:13:59 <thuna`>	bpalmer: meh, worst case scenario I'll spam random text and get kicked
Feb 21 19:22:53 <bpalmer>	thuna`: I guess I'd be more paranoid about missing messages (accidentally blocking .* or the like)
Feb 21 19:23:38 <thuna`>	bpalmer: No, that's basically why I hate the regexp-based ignore
Feb 21 19:24:23 <thuna`>	(As in, you're right, but it's not because I'm running that on my main connection that it's a problem)
Feb 21 19:27:29 <thuna`>	regexp is at best difficult to read and write.  Doubly so if you're trying to match text that's trying to bypass the filter as well.  The chance of making a mistake is too high
Feb 21 19:28:33 <thuna`>	Speaking of which: let's see if the multi-nick-mention-ignore works.
Feb 21 19:32:16 <thuna`>	@-mentions are also not recognized.  Good to know.
Feb 21 19:32:33 <johnjaye>	i'm using chatgpt to get price quotes on hotel rates. that seems pretty easy
Feb 21 19:32:41 <johnjaye>	google doesn't do this unless i'm using it wrong
Feb 21 19:32:56 <johnjaye>	you have to go to a site that specializes in this kind of thing, but chatgpt gets the result slightly faster
Feb 21 19:33:49 <grym>	there's zero way i would trust that in the slightest
Feb 21 19:34:13 <e1f>	yeah, those chatgpt prices are from 2022
Feb 21 19:34:17 <johnjaye>	well i tried a similar query in google. i just get generic ad type results
Feb 21 19:34:38 <johnjaye>	when i clicked the shopping tab the top row says $1868 to stay at the Grace Hotel in the Aegean
Feb 21 19:35:22 <johnjaye>	grym: because prices vary so much it's more efficient to just go to the airline or hotel website and do a query there?
Feb 21 19:35:51 <grym>	johnjaye: the merchant is the only price source worth trusting
Feb 21 19:36:01 <grym>	be that the base site or a reseller.
Feb 21 19:36:31 <tyson2>	that's what I've found, aggregators aren't that efficient or accurate
Feb 21 19:37:43 <johnjaye>	ah ok. i didn't know there was a business term for that already
Feb 21 19:38:11 <tyson2>	what I'm looking for is a business term that describes Mr. Beast
Feb 21 19:38:18 <johnjaye>	"influencer"
Feb 21 19:38:36 <tyson2>	not many influencers have become moguls like he has
Feb 21 19:39:07 <tyson2>	his net worth apparently exceed 1B now
Feb 21 19:39:08 <technomancy>	isn't that the goal they all have tho?
Feb 21 19:39:15 <tyson2>	right, but few achieve it
Feb 21 19:39:31 <tyson2>	I work for a company that trains aspiring influencers
Feb 21 19:39:42 <technomancy>	I'm sorry
Feb 21 19:39:48 <tyson2>	can't be helped
Feb 21 19:40:09 <technomancy>	not in this economy anyway
Feb 21 19:40:19 <tyson2>	any port in a storm
Feb 21 19:41:03 <e1f>	you need to train some emacs influencers
Feb 21 19:41:18 <tyson2>	there is one, sacha chua
Feb 21 19:41:29 <bpalmer>	Mr. Beast is large enough that it's fair to probably describe him as just the face of a production studio.
Feb 21 19:41:30 <tyson2>	who is likely online now
Feb 21 19:42:00 <tyson2>	bpalmer: agree, I will look into him a bit more deeply, he might be a collaborator with us
Feb 21 19:42:07 <technomancy>	rudybot: is mister beast an idoru?
Feb 21 19:42:08 <rudybot>	technomancy: oh, the korean idoru
Feb 21 19:42:31 <bpalmer>	tyson2: e.g., I see on wikipedia that Mr. Beast is said to employ over 250 employees (including writers, editors, and producers).
Feb 21 19:42:47 <tromey>	but does he use emacs
Feb 21 19:44:57 <thuna`>	Hrm.... I don't see a way to distinguish between a "long text here: more text" message and a "nick1 nick2 nick3: full text".
Feb 21 19:45:14 <grym>	sachac: you hear that, you're an influencer now!
Feb 21 19:46:00 <bpalmer>	thuna`: how common is that multiple nicks precede a message?
Feb 21 19:46:02 <thuna`>	(And if I'm not distinguishing between the two I end up with non-replies to nicks being ignored as well but only some of the time)
Feb 21 19:46:24 <thuna`>	bpalmer: I see it every now and then.  My main goal is to avoid workarounds
Feb 21 19:46:36 <e3d3>	thuna`: ? you regex doesn't know/recognize existing user names ?
Feb 21 19:46:54 <e3d3>	as such
Feb 21 19:47:37 <thuna`>	e3d3: You can do that but then you just throw in a non-existent nick and there goes that.  I guess in general what I'm trying to do is impossible.
Feb 21 19:48:37 <thuna`>	Maybe I'll have an rcirc-ignore-strategy variable somewhere and leave it to the user
Feb 21 19:49:02 <tyson2>	bpalmer: I guess we have to call him an Influencer-industrial-complex bigwig
Feb 21 19:49:46 <technomancy>	a human who was consumed by a brand
Feb 21 19:50:01 <tyson2>	technomancy: another good way to put it
Feb 21 19:50:33 <e3d3>	I can't think of a foolproof filters/regex
Feb 21 19:52:25 <thuna`>	e3d3: Yeah, I don't think it's possible.  The best you can do is try to handle people unintentionally getting around the filter.
Feb 21 19:53:47 <e3d3>	I really appreciate reactions from bpalmer, if not talking off-topic, so for now I keep toggling ignoring him (and some bots) on and off, with help of a hydra.
Feb 21 19:55:50 <corwin>	I don't know what any of that means but it sounds like you have some hydras you are happy with.  That's nice.
Feb 21 19:57:12 <e3d3>	corwin: I have a brain the size of a peanut so love & need my hydra's, and tweaking them with colors, tooltips etc
Feb 21 19:57:30 <corwin>	I wrote a custom /ban command that elevates privs using CHANSERV, if necessary.  I'm pretty happy with that: https://git.sr.ht/~mplscorwin/dotfiles/tree/master/item/elisp/init-erc-30.el#L164
Feb 21 20:00:13 <corwin>	I'm stuck on the idea of learning as many of the default bindings as I can (rather than replacing them with something I think I'll remember for my own reasons, or making bespoke UI for myself, both of which I've tried a little).  Not saying this is better, just my fixation.  Anyway, I solve the same problem with ,,which-key
Feb 21 20:00:14 <fsbot>	which-key is [0] at https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key
Feb 21 20:00:14 <fsbot>	[1] A minor mode for Emacs that displays the key bindings following your currently entered incomplete command (a prefix) in a popup.
Feb 21 20:01:03 <thuna`>	How would people feel about an option like https://0x0.st/H5bz.txt in rcirc?
Feb 21 20:01:40 <johnjaye>	bpalmer: mr. beast is the rider and his youtube studio is the elephant
Feb 21 20:02:16 <tyson2>	johnjaye: one could describe many personages using that approach
Feb 21 20:03:30 <johnjaye>	by the way corwin did you mistakenly send me a message before? you were saying i was offended about something but i don't recall what you meant.
Feb 21 20:03:57 <corwin>	hmm, in that case never mind? sorry, I can't recall the context and don't want to go log surfing.
Feb 21 20:04:19 <corwin>	But sorry if I offended you, obviously.  That does sound like a me thing to do.
Feb 21 20:05:27 <johnjaye>	no problem, i didn't think you did.
Feb 21 20:05:49 <johnjaye>	also sometimes i think i might appear to be here when i got disconnected. not sure why but my raspi has to be reset anytime the power flickers here
Feb 21 20:06:21 <jvml>	just set up elfeed, feels very nice to have a way to keep in touch with blogs i like
Feb 21 20:09:09 <e3d3>	corwin: I also use & like which-key, and try to use for the keybindings that I want to learn the regular keybindings in my hydra's (e.g. in mode-specific hydra's), or use a tooltip to show these.
Feb 21 20:10:26 <e3d3>	corwin: I use . to open mode-specific hydra's for dired, ibuffer etc, most with the same single letter keybindings
Feb 21 20:10:36 <corwin>	👍🏻
Feb 21 20:11:28 <bpalmer>	,leader
Feb 21 20:11:29 <fsbot>	evil-leader is https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader
Feb 21 20:12:03 <bpalmer>	oh, general, I guess.
Feb 21 20:12:20 <bpalmer>	,general
Feb 21 20:12:21 <fsbot>	general is More convenient key definitions in emacs https://github.com/noctuid/general.el
Feb 21 20:13:54 <rpav>	oh huh that's like the 200lb gorilla version of what i was doing with freekey
Feb 21 20:14:45 <rpav>	not sure i ever even posted it, but basically "reassign" / "redirect assignements" from <prefix> to <other-prefix>
Feb 21 20:15:21 <e3d3>	rpav: you mean the free-key package that only shows free keybindings
Feb 21 20:15:36 <rpav>	e3d3: nah i must have missed that when i searched though
Feb 21 20:15:41 <bpalmer>	I was thinking in terms of providing predicate dispatch functionality. E.g., rather than repeatedly rebind a key locally, you can define it once to a command that changes what it does based on, e.g., buffer position and mode
Feb 21 20:15:53 <e3d3>	rpav: okay, np
Feb 21 20:16:04 <rpav>	https://github.com/rpav/freekey.el/ .. basically i wanted C-x and C-c back
Feb 21 20:16:22 <bpalmer>	rpav:  you're not one of those CUA proponents, are you?
Feb 21 20:16:25 <rpav>	and am very happy with C-x to C-p actually.. though my `p` key is next to `m`
Feb 21 20:16:28 *	bpalmer shuffles away from rpav on the group W bench
Feb 21 20:16:55 <rpav>	bpalmer: vaguely but mostly out of "i use too many different things and want standard bindings"
Feb 21 20:17:22 <rpav>	bpalmer: but i'm _also_ a proponent of the classic mark, and don't like to have to use the transient mark for cua-mode etc
Feb 21 20:17:35 <bpalmer>	oh, thankfully it's easy to disable transient mark mode
Feb 21 20:17:41 <tyson2>	rpav: I also prefer standard bindings
Feb 21 20:17:55 <bpalmer>	although I've started using it for some "context-sensitive" commands, alas.
Feb 21 20:18:15 <tyson2>	the bindings for emacs are well-chosen IMHO
Feb 21 20:18:24 <johnjaye>	hmm. well lately i've been thinking of just dispensing with all M- commands.
Feb 21 20:18:35 <johnjaye>	most of them I don't use anyway. and M-x can be reassigned to <menu> or something
Feb 21 20:19:11 <johnjaye>	however M-s and M-n/M-p do work when doing regexp search
Feb 21 20:23:03 <rpav>	bpalmer: i actually have the beginnings of an "explicit-mark" thing for some operations, e.g. C-SPC is explicit-set-mark-command and some things _only_ look at the explicit-mark, so if i want to surround a region in {} or similar
Feb 21 20:23:06 <rpav>	fewer surprises
Feb 21 20:23:32 <rpav>	tyson2: yeah it's easier to change emacs than everything else ;/
Feb 21 20:23:45 <rpav>	also i don't like M-w because that often closes windows in everything else and is a bad habit
Feb 21 20:23:52 <rpav>	err C-w
Feb 21 20:24:09 <tyson2>	I just use C-c assignments for new functions that I create, or for a few tools that don't have default bindings
Feb 21 20:24:31 <tyson2>	C-c prefixes I mean
Feb 21 20:24:54 <rpav>	i use <Menu> for prefixes now
Feb 21 20:25:02 <rpav>	err for custom things as a prefix
Feb 21 20:25:22 <Odin-LAP>	A lot of keyboards don't have that anymore.
Feb 21 20:25:45 <rpav>	yeah i started making right-alt (or similar) that when it's otherwise absent, e.g. laptop
Feb 21 20:25:53 <Odin-LAP>	And many have only one key with the Windows logo.
Feb 21 20:26:05 <tyson2>	I used to work at a place that had lisp machines, and I used to maintain the keyboards, but I never really got the chance to use one.  I regret that
Feb 21 20:26:14 <Odin-LAP>	rpav: Ah, monolingual?
Feb 21 20:26:16 <rpav>	a lot of keyboards have some useless right-modifier key that's unreachable and would be otherwise unused
Feb 21 20:26:38 <rpav>	Odin-LAP: yeah but i have another key for compose when i really need it
Feb 21 20:26:54 <bpalmer>	don't forget that new keyboards for windows 11 will have the new "Copilot" ke
Feb 21 20:26:55 <Odin-LAP>	All the brackets are on AltGr keys for me.
Feb 21 20:26:57 <bpalmer>	y
Feb 21 20:26:59 <rpav>	also if i really used it a lot i would use like tex-input-mode or similar
Feb 21 20:27:13 <Odin-LAP>	[ and {, for instance.
Feb 21 20:27:14 <rpav>	bpalmer: poe's law D:
Feb 21 20:27:54 <technomancy>	tyson2: what does maintaining the keyboards mean?
Feb 21 20:28:00 <grym>	let's confuse poe's law and poee's law
Feb 21 20:28:02 <Odin-LAP>	Also ~, ` and @. The last of which is AltGr-Q, which plays extremely well with CUA bindings.
Feb 21 20:28:04 <thuna`>	AltGr also has \ for me
Feb 21 20:28:04 <bpalmer>	rpav: https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/01/04/introducing-a-new-copilot-key-to-kick-off-the-year-of-ai-powered-windows-pcs/
Feb 21 20:28:05 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/UCCKbjNHjT
Feb 21 20:29:00 <dcb>	I'm surprised they didn't try a key exclusively for the user to accept restarting the pc to update
Feb 21 20:29:03 <bpalmer>	I'm not sure whether the copilot key will be adaptable so that mainstream keyboard users can finally get a meta separate from alt.
Feb 21 20:29:06 <technomancy>	"AI will be seamlessly woven into Windows from the system, to the silicon, to the hardware" in other words, we have lots of budget for useless things but we can't afford a copy editor
Feb 21 20:29:33 <grym>	,g you are clippy, an intelligent user interface for office users.  I'm trying to write a form letter, how should i start?
Feb 21 20:29:34 <fsbot>	🤖[g] As an intelligent user interface, I suggest starting your form letter with a clear and engaging opening sentence to grab the recipient's attention.
Feb 21 20:29:50 <technomancy>	maybe they did try to bring a copy editor in to fix this but the copy editor died of horror when they read how stupid the writing was
Feb 21 20:30:08 <grym>	dcb: you don't need a key for that, just yolo the reboot
Feb 21 20:30:12 <Odin-LAP>	bpalmer: It won't. The Windows key is basically not usable for anything on Windows, because the OS eats a huge number of combinations with it.
Feb 21 20:30:28 <bpalmer>	Odin-LAP: but linux users seem to usually use it as super.
Feb 21 20:30:52 <technomancy>	(kind of like how microsoft tried to get a lawyer to review the legality of copilot but every lawyer they asked had a heart attack before they could reply)
Feb 21 20:31:01 <grym>	bpalmer: it's a great i3 leader key!
Feb 21 20:31:10 <rpav>	bpalmer: geez i was leaning "joke" too
Feb 21 20:32:32 <bpalmer>	"Bucky bits were used heavily on keyboards designed by Tom Knight at MIT, including space-cadet keyboards used on LISP machines. These could contain as many as seven modifier keys: SHIFT, CTRL, META, HYPER, SUPER, TOP, and GREEK (also referred to as FRONT)."
Feb 21 20:32:38 <dcb>	grym: I still remember taking my eyes from the screen for a second and noticing a small pop-up screen closing as I pressed Enter (with everything closing and the system taking an hour to update and reboot)
Feb 21 20:32:47 <bpalmer>	Still need a few more special keys on the keyboard to get all the bucky bits back in action.
Feb 21 20:33:03 <Odin-LAP>	bpalmer: Sure. I suspect a new modifier would probably get mapped to 'hyper' more commonly than alt, simply because it's not worth the confusion of having a modifier called 'alt' that is different from the button marked 'alt'.
Feb 21 20:33:43 <Odin-LAP>	It's easier to remember "it's called something different" than it is "the one called that is a different one".
Feb 21 20:33:49 <grym>	your buttons are marked?
Feb 21 20:35:48 <Odin-LAP>	grym: I believe the majority of keyboards in use have labelling.
Feb 21 20:35:56 <grym>	oh for sure
Feb 21 20:36:14 <technomancy>	I don't think they were talking about their keyboard specifically?

Feb 21 20:38:27 <grym>	dcb: the original wasn't
Feb 21 20:40:59 <rpav>	i should get a bunch of keycaps that are just '(' and ')' and joke that it's my keyboard for writing lisp
Feb 21 20:41:44 <technomancy>	add a lambda key and you're basically turing-complete
Feb 21 20:41:52 <technomancy>	well, SKI-complete, which is the same thing but cooler
Feb 21 20:51:45 <mekeor>	hello fellas :)
Feb 21 20:53:13 <mekeor>	gnus' nnmaildir doesn't support nested directories but i found out i can instruct mbsync to flatten the directories. i'm excited to see if it works :D
Feb 21 21:02:17 <mekeor>	and also this week i customized mode-line-format. it's not fully finished but i already like it: https://paste.rs/0PwLe (i wonder how bad it performs and how can i improve performance.)
Feb 21 21:08:34 *	ski complete ?
Feb 21 21:09:51 <mekeor>	ski: excuse me, are you reacting to me?
Feb 21 21:16:47 <rpav>	ski free
Feb 21 21:17:06 <rpav>	mekeor: it was to technomancy afaict
Feb 21 21:20:45 *	ski doesn't ski
Feb 21 21:20:58 <ski>	aye, rpav
Feb 21 21:27:03 <jvml>	hello again all!
Feb 21 21:28:05 <edgar-rft>	no, please not all again
Feb 21 21:30:29 <hodapp>	okay I think I finally finished my diagram explaining to myself the connections and differences between marginalia, orderless, corfu, consult, embark, ivy, counsel, swiper, vertico, company, and ido-mode
Feb 21 21:30:38 <hodapp>	but now I'm so confused I feel like I need another diagram
Feb 21 21:31:09 <grym>	the aristocrats!
Feb 21 21:31:17 <a51>	is it possible to make fonts a bit "tall" ? is it the height settings I have to adjust ? sometimes some fonts appear small
Feb 21 21:31:44 <a51>	I would like my fonts like a model :) skinny and tall :)
Feb 21 21:32:28 <mekeor>	a51: try out M-x customize-face RET default RET
Feb 21 21:32:43 <grym>	a51: so, ioveska
Feb 21 21:33:18 <mekeor>	a51: try :width and :weight attributes
Feb 21 21:33:25 <a51>	my current font setting (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Iosevka Nerd Font" :height 210)
Feb 21 21:33:31 <edgar-rft>	sounds like you want misc-fixed 1x100
Feb 21 21:33:43 <jvml>	i just keep emacs in whatever the default monospace font on windows is
Feb 21 21:33:51 <jvml>	doesn't work for everything but it works for many things
Feb 21 21:34:00 <jvml>	courier new? i dunno
Feb 21 21:35:32 <a51>	edgar-rft: what should be misc-fixed format for a 32 inch monitor ?
Feb 21 21:37:18 <edgar-rft>	depends on the pixel resolution
Feb 21 21:37:59 <a51>	2560x1440
Feb 21 21:38:16 <a51>	edgar-rft: misc-fixed is set in .Xresources ?
Feb 21 21:38:21 <a51>	or init.el ?
Feb 21 21:40:44 <hodapp>	I'm still a little lost on how counsel and company can coexist
Feb 21 21:41:24 <rpav>	i thought counsel was a minibuffer thing
Feb 21 21:41:47 <rpav>	yeah
Feb 21 21:42:18 <rpav>	company is a buffer thing (though maybe it also does minibuffer, but if so it probably similarly has specific commands?)
Feb 21 21:43:15 <edgar-rft>	a51: I have the line "Emacs.font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-*-*-*-c-60-*" in my ~/.Xresources but it can also be set in init.el - where I first must lookup howto set it in init.el
Feb 21 21:43:36 <ohnoitsnoah>	Howdyyy
Feb 21 21:45:37 <jvml>	hello ohnoitsnoah!
Feb 21 21:45:43 <jvml>	what brings you here today?
Feb 21 21:46:20 <ohnoitsnoah>	Nothing much, I'm just messing with ERC. I didn't know Emacs had an IRC client, but I'm far from suprised lol
Feb 21 21:46:37 <rpav>	erc is damn good
Feb 21 21:46:47 <ohnoitsnoah>	It works super nice!!
Feb 21 21:46:50 <JohnGalt>	I need to look more into how to configure it
Feb 21 21:46:52 <a51>	edgar-rft: you don't put the name of the font in my case Iosevka Nerd Font
Feb 21 21:46:58 <rpav>	very easy to customize vs every other client i've seen
Feb 21 21:47:28 <jvml>	i'm in erc as well! i've been getting back into irc since yesterday and it's been super pleasant
Feb 21 21:48:05 <johnjaye>	ohnoitsnoah: i should try it out. i normally use weechat+tmux
Feb 21 21:48:10 <jvml>	this is one of my favorite channels because i've been hyperfixated on emacs for the past few years
Feb 21 21:48:15 <jvml>	i always access it from erc
Feb 21 21:48:17 <johnjaye>	but if i abandon tmux then it would make sense to abandon weechat as well
Feb 21 21:48:40 <a51>	edgar-rft: is there a compromise ? I guess we can't have both of "worlds" ... increase size and we have fewer lines ... I have 32 inch monitor and I would like to have at least 34 lines at least ...
Feb 21 21:48:42 <rpav>	johnjaye: and with emacs server you can connect/reconnect/multiply-connect as well
Feb 21 21:48:46 <ohnoitsnoah>	Me too jvml
Feb 21 21:48:53 <rpav>	between gui and tui even
Feb 21 21:49:06 <ohnoitsnoah>	I was gonna give a talk at EmacsConf last year, but class and other stuff got in the way, so I dropped :/
Feb 21 21:49:35 <jvml>	ohnoitsnoah: what kind of stuff do you use emacs for, how do you make it a part of your life?
Feb 21 21:50:42 <technomancy>	johnjaye: I run erc in tmux
Feb 21 21:50:55 <technomancy>	makes sense to keep it together if you jump around machines
Feb 21 21:51:01 <ohnoitsnoah>	jvml: I mostly use it for just general programming, git control, etc. I also use it to keep school notes and a todo list
Feb 21 21:51:55 <johnjaye>	what does that mean. you run emacs in tmux and erc inside emacs?
Feb 21 21:52:01 <johnjaye>	i meant using emacs for tabs instead of tmux
Feb 21 21:52:05 <johnjaye>	which is what i'm doing now
Feb 21 21:52:23 <bpalmer>	ohnoitsnoah: emacs has multiple irc clients. erc and rcirc are both included in standard emacs, but see also ,,ircclients
Feb 21 21:52:28 <fsbot>	ircclients: erc, zenirc, liece, riece, irchat, kiwi, rockers (irc-mode), emirc, rcirc, circe, elim, weechat.el
Feb 21 21:52:43 <rpav>	damn
Feb 21 21:52:52 <ohnoitsnoah>	neat lol
Feb 21 21:53:05 <rpav>	are any of them _easier_ to customize / more featureful than erc?
Feb 21 21:53:13 <jvml>	personally i use emacs as a way to keep track of writing and manage information i've collected. org-mode is extremely helpful for note-taking (the info management part i mentioned) and putting together ideas, and for the former reason i got really into it when i started college a few months ago. i also organize the writing for my collaborative encyclopedic fantasy novel and just edit (plain)text in general using emacs, and it really
Feb 21 21:53:13 <jvml>	helps me as a writer
Feb 21 21:53:28 <ohnoitsnoah>	I've never messed with irc. I just decided to mess with it today since I'd rather do this than my assignment
Feb 21 21:53:32 <rpav>	my main gripe is total filtering isn't as easy to control as it ought to be, e.g. functions for applying formatting and highlights
Feb 21 21:53:49 <ohnoitsnoah>	jvml: Emacs also helps with writing. Org-Mode is a god-send
Feb 21 21:53:55 <ohnoitsnoah>	*helps me
Feb 21 21:53:58 <bpalmer>	rpav: rcirc is simpler which potentially means easier; circe has an architecture separating the UI layer from the communication layer which may be easier.
Feb 21 21:54:06 <rpav>	bpalmer: hrm k
Feb 21 21:54:53 <ohnoitsnoah>	I'm in hs so my note-taking is a lot less than I'm sure it will be in the coming years, but still helpful none the less
Feb 21 21:55:23 <jvml>	i've also been using org-mode to export pages for the website i maintain for the novel (https://thiswillneverend.neocities.org), in combination with a custom stylesheet adapted for org exports
Feb 21 21:55:44 <johnjaye>	ohnoitsnoah: do all your notes in json files and only use jq queries to manage it.
Feb 21 21:56:02 <a51>	is it necessary to have nerd fonts in emacs is a font that has emoji includes nerd fonts too ?
Feb 21 21:56:05 <jvml>	ohnoitsnoah: i found out about emacs when i was in high school too! absolutely changed the digital side of my life for the better
Feb 21 21:56:12 <alcor>	Interesting to see HS Emacs'ers. I used to use vim in HS, then "graduated" to Emacs
Feb 21 21:56:18 <ohnoitsnoah>	jvml: I used to use org-mode to export stuff, but I got lazy with it and just moved to straight HTML, which ironically is more work lol
Feb 21 21:56:33 <johnjaye>	don't use emacs. it will ruin your life.
Feb 21 21:56:43 <johnjaye>	Someone offers you s-expressions to solve your problems? Just say no!
Feb 21 21:56:44 <ohnoitsnoah>	jvml: yesss i love it. It's just an amazing tool in general, for tons of things
Feb 21 21:56:52 <jvml>	i'm a freshman in college so i'm not too far off from being in high school i guess LOL
Feb 21 21:57:01 <jvml>	but i definitely think of myself as an adult
Feb 21 21:57:05 <JohnGalt>	.emacs takes a lot of time
Feb 21 21:57:27 <ohnoitsnoah>	I've been messing with Lisp recently, so once again Emacs saved the day with just being a good piece of software to work in
Feb 21 21:57:30 <jvml>	i got into elfeed recently and i've been editing my .emacs so much to add the tags for all the sites it reads rss feeds from
Feb 21 21:57:56 <a51>	what is the consensus ? nerd fonts or emoji fonts ?
Feb 21 21:58:07 <jvml>	oh lisp!!!! i'm really interested in lisp too, especially Common and obv elisp as well, but i haven't had time to do programming when i work on so many other cool things
Feb 21 21:58:33 <a51>	emoji fonts I guess are for neotree and treemacs for icons right ?
Feb 21 21:58:51 <jvml>	god i'm trying to remember how i discovered emacs
Feb 21 21:59:07 <technomancy>	I don't think you need special fonts to get tree rendering characters?
Feb 21 21:59:19 <a51>	treemacs icons
Feb 21 21:59:21 <technomancy>	all that box drawing stuff is pretty standard
Feb 21 21:59:21 <a51>	I meant
Feb 21 21:59:32 <a51>	and dired icons too
Feb 21 21:59:42 <ohnoitsnoah>	jvml: I found it after working with Vim when working on my website, and then I just fell into the rabbit hole
Feb 21 21:59:42 <alcor>	The icon font is for folder / mime type icons
Feb 21 22:00:27 <a51>	I like Iosveka font, but which one to set for default ? Iosveka Term ? Iosevka Nerd Font ?
Feb 21 22:00:29 <alcor>	Could it be that vim is the most popular "gateway drug" to Emacs? Hmm...
Feb 21 22:00:49 <jvml>	i think i first used it in november 2020, i used to know a little bit of vim way back in the day and i was aware of the "editor wars" many years before using emacs
Feb 21 22:00:57 <jvml>	but i never knew vim very well lol
Feb 21 22:01:04 <a51>	alcor: if you like vim evil-mode gives the best experience
Feb 21 22:01:13 <jvml>	i don't really like the weirdness of having to choose different modes for inserting text honestly
Feb 21 22:01:20 <jvml>	i like being able to type from the get-go
Feb 21 22:01:51 <technomancy>	alcor: spacemacs brought in a ton of my co-workers a few years ago
Feb 21 22:01:56 <technomancy>	and then it kinda just ... stopped?
Feb 21 22:02:22 <alcor>	spaceemacs was hyped on reddit & HN for a while
Feb 21 22:02:25 <jvml>	i've never felt the need to use evil or spacemacs but i respect anyone who does
Feb 21 22:02:31 <jvml>	they both seem fun
Feb 21 22:03:05 <JohnGalt>	Emacs excels in lisp development
Feb 21 22:03:30 <jvml>	i don't really code all that much but emacs' handling of written language is enough to keep me coming back
Feb 21 22:03:34 <alcor>	I remember I started out with spacemacs, but then I accepted the superiority of a bedrock-like vanilla/minimal config, which, starting from Emacs 29+, could be quite comfy
Feb 21 22:03:35 <JohnGalt>	I tend to use markdown for permanent notes, and a ticket system for tracking tasks
Feb 21 22:04:01 <rpav>	emacs does a lot of things pretty well.. much if it some flavor of "you can make it work like you want"
Feb 21 22:04:02 <ohnoitsn`>	sorry, my laptop connected to my school wifi and it kicked me out lol
Feb 21 22:04:11 <a51>	I was told earlier for font to look "tall" to use misc-fixed but is it possible to set misc-fixed with Iosevka ?
Feb 21 22:05:18 <jvml>	i just use the default configuration with a few extra keybinds for specific purposes, like if i need to type something по-русски or write IPA for my liŋɡwɪstɪks homework
Feb 21 22:05:24 <JohnGalt>	DejaVu Sans Mono works well with emacs, especially for matching up braces
Feb 21 22:06:00 <noahhh`>	what happens if I time out and can't use the username I was using
Feb 21 22:06:07 <jvml>	i have those bound to (kbd "C-c r") and (kbd "C-c I") respectively
Feb 21 22:06:14 <noahhh>	Can I just not get it back lol
Feb 21 22:06:18 <Odin-LAP>	jvml: ᚱᚢᛋᛋᚾᛖᛋᚲᚨ?
Feb 21 22:06:19 <jvml>	oh you got it
Feb 21 22:06:42 <jvml>	LOL
Feb 21 22:06:59 <jvml>	hello again!
Feb 21 22:07:00 <ohnoitsnoah>	Okay I got it nevermind lol
Feb 21 22:07:04 <ohnoitsnoah>	Hai! sorry
Feb 21 22:07:16 <ohnoitsnoah>	I was bugging out erc by having multiple instances running lol
Feb 21 22:07:21 <ohnoitsnoah>	Still new to irc
Feb 21 22:07:41 <a51>	I guess Emacs.font: Iosevka Nerd Font :weight=regular:size=29 is perfect gives me 34 lines :)
Feb 21 22:07:42 <jvml>	takes time to figure out! no shame in stumbling a little
Feb 21 22:08:01 <jvml>	ohnoitsnoah: have you registered your nick on libera yet?
Feb 21 22:08:11 <ohnoitsnoah>	Nopeeee
Feb 21 22:08:16 <ohnoitsnoah>	where do I go to do that?
Feb 21 22:08:40 <jvml>	you would type something like this
Feb 21 22:08:59 <jvml>	/msg NickServ REGISTER [your username] [your password]
Feb 21 22:09:10 <jvml>	i might be wrong though it's been a minute since i did that
Feb 21 22:09:14 <alcor>	ohnoitsnoah: There's a detailed guide on https://libera.chat/guides/registration if you're interested
Feb 21 22:09:24 <jvml>	oh nvm it's
Feb 21 22:09:28 <jvml>	it's a little different
Feb 21 22:09:33 <jvml>	just use the guide and ignore me LOL
Feb 21 22:10:05 <jvml>	had a bit of a brainfart i guess
Feb 21 22:10:08 <JohnGalt>	I just got my db wrapper working! this calls for a tumbler of some good scotch
Feb 21 22:10:47 <alcor>	The libera chat website also offers on okayish guide on IRC basics: https://libera.chat/guides/basics – enough for daily use
Feb 21 22:10:47 <jvml>	ohnoitsnoah: make sure you right down the password someplace though
Feb 21 22:10:51 <ohnoitsnoah>	awesomeee, I'm registering rn :)
Feb 21 22:11:07 <jvml>	glad to hear it!
Feb 21 22:11:39 <jvml>	registering will give you the ability to send private messages and secure the nickname you have right now for yourself
Feb 21 22:11:41 <jvml>	iirc
Feb 21 22:12:06 <ohnoitsnoah>	Awesomeee, done and done
Feb 21 22:12:12 <jvml>	:)
Feb 21 22:13:34 <ohnoitsnoah>	I've been reading HTDP in between classes
Feb 21 22:13:48 <ohnoitsnoah>	Scheme is super cool
Feb 21 22:13:55 <JohnGalt>	agreed
Feb 21 22:14:12 <JohnGalt>	SICP is one of the best works ever
Feb 21 22:14:23 <ohnoitsnoah>	I made my gf a small program in it for Valentines day, super fun to work with
Feb 21 22:14:32 <jvml>	scheme is lovely!
Feb 21 22:14:52 <ohnoitsnoah>	Although I wrote it in DrRacket, which is nice but I'm sure the writing experience isn't much different in Emacs
Feb 21 22:15:04 <jvml>	and what would SICP be? i'm somewhat uninitiated in the ways of programming literature
Feb 21 22:15:09 <alcor>	Do you use it with the PLT IDE (I remember it was called DrScheme, or DrRacket now after the rename?)
Feb 21 22:15:18 <ohnoitsnoah>	Structure and Interprtation of Computer Programs jvml
Feb 21 22:15:21 <JohnGalt>	Structure and Interpretation of Computer programs
Feb 21 22:15:24 <jvml>	oh i recognize that name now
Feb 21 22:15:35 <JohnGalt>	the old MIT intro to comp sci book before they went python
Feb 21 22:15:37 <jvml>	acronym just wasn't ringing a bell
Feb 21 22:15:42 <ohnoitsnoah>	ancor: I have, but I wanna start writing it in Emacs
Feb 21 22:15:56 <ohnoitsnoah>	That IDE is actually super awesome
Feb 21 22:16:45 <a51>	is it true for real apps in lisp clisp is the way to go ?
Feb 21 22:16:49 <ohnoitsnoah>	JohnGalt: My friends make fun of me because they're all like emo kids, and we all play in a band, and after our shows when we go out to eat, I like watching them wuth my meal lol
Feb 21 22:16:59 <jvml>	i'm extremely fond of common lisp
Feb 21 22:17:04 <ohnoitsnoah>	Those old MIT videos are still sick
Feb 21 22:17:16 <jvml>	ohnoitsnoah: what instrument(s) do you play?
Feb 21 22:17:22 <ohnoitsnoah>	jvml: me too, also a very nice language
Feb 21 22:17:35 <JohnGalt>	other people will always try to tear down what they cant do
Feb 21 22:17:35 <ohnoitsnoah>	jvml: I "sing" (scream lol) and play guitar
Feb 21 22:17:58 <jvml>	i'm a music producer mostly so i play a lot of electronic instruments
Feb 21 22:17:58 <ohnoitsnoah>	a51: Possibly??? I've seen some cool stuff made in Scheme/Racket
Feb 21 22:17:59 <technomancy>	a51: not really
Feb 21 22:18:00 <jvml>	but also trombone
Feb 21 22:18:08 <alcor>	DrRacket has a good and user-friendly debugger. In Emacs there's "Geiser" which offers major/minor modes for several Scheme implementations.
Feb 21 22:18:22 <JohnGalt>	man I forgot about geiser
Feb 21 22:18:26 <ohnoitsnoah>	jvml: I also do electronic stuff on the side!
Feb 21 22:18:34 <technomancy>	a51: clisp isn't really a very competitive implementation
Feb 21 22:18:44 <JohnGalt>	sbcl is better
Feb 21 22:18:50 <jvml>	you have a bandcamp or anything?
Feb 21 22:18:53 <johnjaye>	better how?
Feb 21 22:18:57 <technomancy>	a51: it depends what you're trying to do of course
Feb 21 22:18:59 <johnjaye>	faster? stronger? smarter?
Feb 21 22:19:07 <JohnGalt>	more support in documentation and very portable
Feb 21 22:19:08 <ohnoitsnoah>	technomancy: yeah I feel like scheme is better for like educational stuff
Feb 21 22:19:26 <JohnGalt>	I used clojure in production a long time ago
Feb 21 22:19:31 <johnjaye>	jvml: do you know how to work the compressor? i can't find a good youtube tutorial on it
Feb 21 22:19:32 <ohnoitsnoah>	jvml: Yes! My old noise/drone ambient project from middle school is https://maddieisreal.bandcamp.com
Feb 21 22:19:35 <alcor>	johnjaye: Well… SBCL is actively maintained, as opposed to CLISP which has only sporadic commit activity
Feb 21 22:19:44 <ohnoitsnoah>	my new band is at https://nicolesdeath.bandcamp.com tho lol
Feb 21 22:19:58 <jvml>	almost all of the material i've done is at https://janislago.bandcamp.com
Feb 21 22:20:01 <technomancy>	ohnoitsnoah: yeah especially the documentation and books are top notch
Feb 21 22:20:20 <ohnoitsnoah>	JohnGalt: been meaning to try it. Seems interesting
Feb 21 22:20:23 <rpav>	johnjaye: do it, make it, work it?
Feb 21 22:20:49 <ohnoitsnoah>	Alright it's about to be passing period for me, I'll join back when I get to my next class
Feb 21 22:20:51 <ohnoitsnoah>	byeee yall
Feb 21 22:20:56 <technomancy>	lol
Feb 21 22:21:17 <jvml>	johnjaye: i can't really give specific advice on how to work the compressor because it kinda depends on every individual effect unit, but think of the compressor as a way to lower dynamic range first and foremost. it's a way to make the quiet part more even with the loud in a signal
Feb 21 22:21:47 <JohnGalt>	I live for dynamic range
Feb 21 22:21:56 <JohnGalt>	I have an amp, I dont need it compressed
Feb 21 22:22:07 <johnjaye>	do you use audacity and fl studio?
Feb 21 22:22:24 <jvml>	i use ableton for the most part, though i also have a fair amount of hardware
Feb 21 22:22:28 <a51>	"nowdays" we can't escape the web ... is clojure the "best bet" for a startup backed with vc $$$ ? this seems the best clojure app https://penpot.app/
Feb 21 22:22:29 <yates_home>	how do i define a key binding containing a function key in this style? (global-set-key [(control ?F4)] (blah)
Feb 21 22:22:34 <yates_home>	like that?
Feb 21 22:22:44 <technomancy>	a51: clojure is definitely the easiest to hire for, and has the best access to libraries
Feb 21 22:23:07 <JohnGalt>	you can find some desperate companies with clojure the dont know what to do with
Feb 21 22:23:10 <jvml>	i used to use audacity but that was when i was only just barely starting out
Feb 21 22:23:28 <technomancy>	(I work in Clojure, maintain Fennel, and have written a lot of Elisp and a little Racket)
Feb 21 22:23:40 <JohnGalt>	I had one company hound me for 3 months with some clojure a guy left behind
Feb 21 22:24:40 <JohnGalt>	is Perl6 totally dead?
Feb 21 22:25:04 <rpav>	was it ever really alive
Feb 21 22:25:09 <JohnGalt>	there was pugs
Feb 21 22:25:13 <JohnGalt>	parrot
Feb 21 22:25:19 <JohnGalt>	I submitted patches to parrot
Feb 21 22:26:24 <JohnGalt>	it had a good concept , but nobody was able to bootstrap parrot properly
Feb 21 22:26:24 <e1f>	i vaguely remember perl7 is being worked on
Feb 21 22:26:47 *	e1f is still on perl5
Feb 21 22:26:55 <jvml>	i saw something about perl7 recently but didn't think much of it
Feb 21 22:29:27 <e1f>	python is pretty much supplanted perl in terms of popularity
Feb 21 22:29:57 <JohnGalt>	when I got back into python it was the highest paid
Feb 21 22:30:17 <rpav>	i'm not a python fan really but i'd _way_ rather python than perl
Feb 21 22:30:17 <alcor>	aren't the basically data science jobs?
Feb 21 22:30:40 <JohnGalt>	theres alot more than that
Feb 21 22:30:50 <JohnGalt>	general backend work
Feb 21 22:31:03 <JohnGalt>	the other one for backend is java
Feb 21 22:31:56 <JohnGalt>	both java and python are good options
Feb 21 22:32:18 <johnjaye>	technomancy: is clojure good to get hired at desperate companies that don't know what they're doing?
Feb 21 22:32:47 <jvml>	will be on my way now so i can do some design/writing, cheers!
Feb 21 22:32:50 <jvml>	o7
Feb 21 22:33:31 <ohnoitsnoah>	Chemistry class yayyyyyy
Feb 21 22:33:40 <ohnoitsnoah>	I don't like this class but eh it's all good
Feb 21 22:34:40 <technomancy>	johnjaye: no, the desperate companies that don't know what they're doing all demand that their engineers rewrite everything in golang, assuming they ever even started with clojure
Feb 21 22:34:43 <Thaodan>	Hey I'm trying to clear out a line matching a regex non interactively to filter out some garbage that java spits out. When I call the code manually it works but not inside this function. Any ideas?
Feb 21 22:34:44 <Thaodan>	https://github.com/Thaodan/plantuml-mode/commits/try_to_filterout_java_junk
Feb 21 22:35:32 <rpav>	is the variable actually the regex you want
Feb 21 22:36:50 <Thaodan>	what you mean? If you ask if the regex inside the variable works then yes.
Feb 21 22:37:38 <mathrick>	argh, I hate how completely useless Emacs maintainers are at integrating existing projects into the core
Feb 21 22:38:04 <mekeor>	mathrick: context?
Feb 21 22:38:05 <mathrick>	every single time, they go off and do their own thing that's now incompatible with existing packages
Feb 21 22:38:06 <technomancy>	IME that's a blessing in disguise
Feb 21 22:38:18 <technomancy>	if it were in core it would become a pain to contribute to
Feb 21 22:38:18 <JohnGalt>	I think melpa put a stake into adding things into core
Feb 21 22:38:48 <mathrick>	mekeor: right now, tree-sitter integration in 29 being totally different from packages for <29, and in the past, stuff like CEDET / Semantic
Feb 21 22:39:16 <Thaodan>	RMS likes to talk shit about melpa
Feb 21 22:39:26 <mathrick>	where they completely fucked up the API to the point pretty much *all* code using semantic was broken
Feb 21 22:39:42 <JohnGalt>	Its stunning but I think emacs has more external completion tools than python has package managers
Feb 21 22:39:45 <mathrick>	technomancy: that's actually what I'm talking about
Feb 21 22:39:53 <mathrick>	shit being added to the core is a *bad* thing
Feb 21 22:40:19 <mathrick>	it effectively creates a hard fork of whatever they're adding and they have no regard for any sort of compatibility, backward or forward
Feb 21 22:40:25 <Thaodan>	I only know of two completion frameworks and one that's dead
Feb 21 22:40:43 <JohnGalt>	company, cedet, lsp, etc..
Feb 21 22:40:46 <Thaodan>	capf, company and auto-complete
Feb 21 22:40:52 <mathrick>	there's Company, AC (long dead), CAPF
Feb 21 22:41:10 <JohnGalt>	slime kinda counts too
Feb 21 22:41:11 <Thaodan>	lsp isn't framework it just plugs into any other the above ^
Feb 21 22:41:34 <mekeor>	fido, ido, icomplete-vertical, vertico
Feb 21 22:41:36 <mathrick>	but IMHO semantic/CEDET being added to the core the way it got added was a large part of made sure it wouldn't be widely used
Feb 21 22:41:45 <mathrick>	mekeor: those are presentation layers
Feb 21 22:41:52 <Thaodan>	Java maintainers say that spitting trash to stderr is a security feature..
Feb 21 22:42:23 <mekeor>	capf, completing-read, pcomplete
Feb 21 22:42:26 <mathrick>	they broke the API so hard in Semantic that all existing documentation immediately became invalid and outdated
Feb 21 22:42:38 <Thaodan>	If don't know what completition frameworks are better research first..
Feb 21 22:42:56 <Thaodan>	MS was a blessing with lsp
Feb 21 22:43:05 <Thaodan>	to bad GNU doesn't integrate it really
Feb 21 22:43:16 <hodapp>	ooh conversation cycled back to what I wanted
Feb 21 22:43:30 <johnjaye>	Thaodan: i don't see how lsp is a blessing by any technical merit
Feb 21 22:43:32 <technomancy>	didn't GNU specifically hate the idea of making compilers extensible?
Feb 21 22:43:44 <technomancy>	the whole debacle with gcc plugins that led to the creation of clang?
Feb 21 22:43:44 <JohnGalt>	yes
Feb 21 22:43:45 <johnjaye>	it seems it's just "corpo defined a standard to do something so everyone does that thing by that standard now"
Feb 21 22:43:53 <JohnGalt>	which is why clang came about
Feb 21 22:43:54 <mekeor>	isn't emacs a compiler extended to be an editor?
Feb 21 22:44:17 <technomancy>	using protocols to expose compiler smarts (aka the whole point of LSP) seems to be exactly what they were afraid of
Feb 21 22:44:20 <mathrick>	https://blog.phundrak.com/emacs-29-what-can-we-expect/ <-- "If you can’t wait to test Tree-Sitter, there is already another package available for Emacs you can use right now. Just be aware this is not the same package as the one that got integrated into Emacs."
Feb 21 22:44:22 <alcor>	with native comp it's indeed a compiler now
Feb 21 22:44:25 <johnjaye>	like if google defined "the google font framework" tomorrow and suddenly everyone switched to it would that be necessarily good?
Feb 21 22:44:26 <mathrick>	this shit right there
Feb 21 22:44:29 <technomancy>	mekeor: yes but it's a compiler for a language that no one else wants to use
Feb 21 22:44:31 <hodapp>	I get a little lost in completion frontends vs. company front-ends
Feb 21 22:45:19 <Thaodan>	"using protocols to expose compiler smarts (aka the whole point of LSP) seems to be exactly what they were afraid of" But isn't that the most efficient way of extending editors?
Feb 21 22:45:21 <mathrick>	hodapp: these days, you should use a CAPF frontend (like corfu) with CAPF providers, rather than a bespoke framework like Company
Feb 21 22:45:33 <mathrick>	it uses standard tools and APIs that other things can plug into
Feb 21 22:45:35 <hodapp>	mathrick: why's that?
Feb 21 22:45:40 <JohnGalt>	GNU was trying to force people to contribute
Feb 21 22:45:43 <hodapp>	any good links on this?
Feb 21 22:45:45 <JohnGalt>	people went elsewhere
Feb 21 22:45:48 <technomancy>	Thaodan: efficiency is lower-priority than political concerns to GNU
Feb 21 22:45:54 <technomancy>	*much* lower priority
Feb 21 22:45:58 <Thaodan>	Even IDE's cant get better unless the talk to the compiler themselves
Feb 21 22:46:16 <technomancy>	Thaodan: but then EEEEVIL proprietary code could use it!!!!
Feb 21 22:46:24 <Thaodan>	technomancy:  I get that but that will restrict users and make them move away
Feb 21 22:46:31 <mathrick>	hodapp: https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202202211546/ https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202202270056/
Feb 21 22:46:36 <mathrick>	very good docs
Feb 21 22:46:39 <hodapp>	mathrick: thanks
Feb 21 22:46:42 <Thaodan>	some GNU people are so far out of reality that it does feel like they are high on something
Feb 21 22:46:46 <mekeor>	i get the impression you folks use emacs to write proprietary code
Feb 21 22:46:51 <JohnGalt>	GNU for professing freedom sure does limit it :]
Feb 21 22:47:03 <technomancy>	Thaodan: then according to GNU they don't deserve gcc
Feb 21 22:47:09 <JohnGalt>	your free to play by GNU's rules
Feb 21 22:47:18 <Thaodan>	They try to force a lot of things that don't work
Feb 21 22:47:19 <technomancy>	Thaodan: (I'm not defending this, I'm just trying to convey their position)
Feb 21 22:47:21 <mathrick>	hodapp: although all-the-icons these days is replaced by something else, lemme look it up
Feb 21 22:47:34 <JohnGalt>	hurd... LOL
Feb 21 22:47:51 <mekeor>	mathrick: nerd-icons?
Feb 21 22:47:51 <Thaodan>	technomancy: Np, I know their position. I frequently comment, provide bug reports to Emacs master
Feb 21 22:47:54 <JohnGalt>	more vaporous than Duke Nukem
Feb 21 22:47:58 <mathrick>	yes, nerd-icons
Feb 21 22:48:03 <mathrick>	I just needed to confirm
Feb 21 22:48:37 <Thaodan>	I think these days GNU has at least partially realized that they will make themselves redundant continuing like this
Feb 21 22:48:44 <mathrick>	https://github.com/rainstormstudio/nerd-icons-completion
Feb 21 22:48:51 <technomancy>	Thaodan: tbh I'm surprised they even accepted eglot into core
Feb 21 22:49:02 <Thaodan>	it's just that some people like rms comment on topics they have no idea about
Feb 21 22:49:22 <Thaodan>	or violate their own rules by talking about tangent topics
Feb 21 22:49:22 <mathrick>	<technomancy> didn't GNU specifically hate the idea of making compilers extensible? <-- RMS mostly, and he's insane
Feb 21 22:49:41 <technomancy>	mathrick: a lot of people still listen to him
Feb 21 22:49:45 <Thaodan>	I know people how met rms, it wasn't pleasent to say the least
Feb 21 22:49:45 <technomancy>	hopefully fewer now than back then
Feb 21 22:49:56 <mathrick>	that's adding DRM so people can't use your code that is supposedly so free for what they want to use it for
Feb 21 22:50:06 <technomancy>	imagine if all the work that went into clang had gone into improving gcc
Feb 21 22:50:33 <Thaodan>	technomancy: re eglot: Yeah I agree even thou eglot suffers the same issue exists in projectile vs project.el
Feb 21 22:51:00 <mathrick>	but RMS is exactly the kind of person to kill to preserve the sanctity of life
Feb 21 22:51:04 <Thaodan>	GCC is catching up not thanks to GNU
Feb 21 22:51:14 <mathrick>	or add DRM to preserve freedom
Feb 21 22:51:18 <hodapp>	mathrick: does eglot automagically work with capf?
Feb 21 22:51:55 <mathrick>	I don't know, LSP is mysterious and I never went through configuring that, so I have little experience there
Feb 21 22:51:56 <technomancy>	hodapp: I think so
Feb 21 22:51:58 <Thaodan>	I'm still angry for GPL-3.0. Many companies don't like it... I wish I could use GPL-3.0 packages on devices.
Feb 21 22:52:00 <mathrick>	but I would hope so
Feb 21 22:52:13 <JohnGalt>	GPL 3 was banned everywhere I worked
Feb 21 22:52:28 <mekeor>	hodapp: yes, eglot defines and sets a capf
Feb 21 22:52:32 <Thaodan>	anyway, any ideas to fix my lisp code? https://github.com/Thaodan/plantuml-mode/commits/try_to_filterout_java_junk
Feb 21 22:52:42 <JohnGalt>	in fact at one company the warning was in triplicate in 24 point red font
Feb 21 22:53:02 <johnw>	every company I've been at, there is a rule against ever touching GPL software
Feb 21 22:53:03 <e1f>	when did gcc go from standing for "gnu c compiler" to "gnu compiler collection"?
Feb 21 22:53:04 <Thaodan>	JohnGalt: for me2 unless it doesn't end up on the device
Feb 21 22:53:15 <technomancy>	but I do gotta say that the trend in core of decoupling implementation and interface like capf and xref is fantastic
Feb 21 22:53:17 <johnw>	using it is OK, but not including it in a project
Feb 21 22:53:23 <hodapp>	well, using this rather than company at least seems easier to understand
Feb 21 22:53:36 <JohnGalt>	helm is what I use
Feb 21 22:53:37 <mathrick>	e1f: a long time ago
Feb 21 22:53:40 <Thaodan>	GPL-2.0 is and was always ok
Feb 21 22:53:43 <JohnGalt>	I love the interface and incremental completion
Feb 21 22:53:57 <hodapp>	technomancy: any good links on this for xref?
Feb 21 22:54:11 <e1f>	mathrick: ok, so rms agreed to it being extensible back then
Feb 21 22:54:16 <Thaodan>	IMHO GNU should help to push GPLv3, resolve the underlying legal issues
Feb 21 22:54:40 <Thaodan>	rms agreed on something like he knows is the almighty emperor
Feb 21 22:54:40 <ohnoitsnoah>	I got an IRC client on my phonee yayy
Feb 21 22:54:41 <technomancy>	hodapp: hmmmmmm not of the top of my head
Feb 21 22:54:46 <e1f>	i assume that's around the time the rewrite to c++ happened
Feb 21 22:55:20 <mekeor>	gcc depends on python btw
Feb 21 22:55:25 <mathrick>	gcc has had stuff like Java compiler for a long time, that's why it was renamed
Feb 21 22:55:37 <Thaodan>	and hopefully rust very soon
Feb 21 22:55:48 <Thaodan>	or linux kernel clang only
Feb 21 22:55:54 <JohnGalt>	ill look at rust when they fix the compile times
Feb 21 22:56:12 <johnjaye>	what is capf?
Feb 21 22:56:13 <fsbot>	capf is a completion-at-point-function
Feb 21 22:56:17 <e1f>	java came out c. 1995?
Feb 21 22:56:18 <johnjaye>	oh right
Feb 21 22:56:22 *	Thaodan *cough* dynamiclink, abi
Feb 21 22:56:31 *	Thaodan *cough* dynamic linking, abi
Feb 21 22:56:47 <mathrick>	e1f: no, gcc's Java compiler, that has nothing to do with Java the language's age
Feb 21 22:56:58 <e1f>	ah, ok
Feb 21 22:57:03 <JohnGalt>	rust is completely replaceable by garbage collection
Feb 21 22:57:03 <Thaodan>	aot for java
Feb 21 22:58:03 <mathrick>	JohnGalt: no, it very specifically does things that aren't replaceable by a GC
Feb 21 22:58:19 <JohnGalt>	mathrick: such as?
Feb 21 22:58:57 <mathrick>	ummm, everything? Including the fact it doesn't depend on a runtime and can provably not alloc in code that can't afford to alloc
Feb 21 22:59:30 <mathrick>	also, provable ownership which eliminates entire categories of bugs data races and other concurrency issues
Feb 21 22:59:47 <e1f>	,g when did gcc add support for a java compiler
Feb 21 22:59:49 <mathrick>	rust has a lot of syntax, more than I'm strictly comfortable with, but it is a very smart project that does what it does really well
Feb 21 23:00:00 <fsbot>	🤖[g] GCC added support for a Java compiler in the late 1990s.
Feb 21 23:00:17 <JohnGalt>	sounds like a bondage langauge
Feb 21 23:00:55 <JohnGalt>	maybe boeing should use it
Feb 21 23:01:00 <rpav>	so a _couple_ things heh
Feb 21 23:01:25 <rpav>	though GC and no-allocation aren't mutually exclusive

Feb 21 23:35:10 <JohnGalt>	I did a study of the heap sort algorithm and found that a textbook, and most code on the internet was completely wrong
Feb 21 23:35:13 <NemesisD>	i'm using vterm in emacs as my terminal and i noticed when i run zellij, when there's a lot of data scrolling by it gets pretty slow specifically when using zellij. however, if i focus the window with the vterm the streaming is no longer slow. is there some sort of redraw prioritization going on here and can i prioritize vterm windows by major mode or something?
Feb 21 23:35:20 <JohnGalt>	only wikipedia and MIT got it right
Feb 21 23:35:30 <JohnGalt>	so now I rely on books for algorithms
Feb 21 23:36:19 <JohnGalt>	AI doesnt help either, it just regurgitates the wrong answers in a summarized form
Feb 21 23:37:05 <hodapp>	what text got it wrong?
Feb 21 23:37:55 <thuna`>	Here's a bare-bones distribution.el.  The generics are defined, reasonable fallback methods are defined (mostly for discrete distributions where you can brute force stuff).  Next up is defining individual distributions themselves.  Do you see anything else that I should add/you would like added?  (Just outline-hide-* everything but the toplevels to see whatall is here) https://0x0.st/H5TK.txt
Feb 21 23:39:16 <JohnGalt>	I can't remember the textbook, it might be in my kindle collection

Feb 21 23:39:23 <JohnGalt>	this is the variations I found
Feb 21 23:40:30 <Thaodan>	NemesisD: I'm not aware of any prioritization. I would if vterm isn't capped somehow. Also check the permonance in other apps using libvterm
Feb 21 23:40:42 <hodapp>	NemesisD: is it specifically Emacs using CPU in this instance, or Zellij? I ask because in trying out Zellij I did not have to go very far to get it in a state where it pegged the CPU at 100%
Feb 21 23:40:53 <hodapp>	specifically, all I had to do was "zellij --layout strider"

Feb 22 00:08:18 <mekeor>	when customizing mode-line-format, should i set variables like mode-line-frame-identification to nil when i don't reference them in my mode-line-format?
Feb 22 00:12:19 <NemesisD>	hodapp: i'm sure zellij is using more CPU than say tmux which was always really snappy in vterm. but i kind of suspect it's emacs or vterm because specifically switching emacs' focus to the vterm window makes it go way faster. like stuff will be scrolling like a slideshow and then the instant i focus the vterm window it's much smoother
Feb 22 00:32:02 <NemesisD>	yeah it looks like it is likely emacs that's cpu bound. when i save a file that causes a rebuild and thus the terminal to scroll, i see emacs shoot up the top cpu usage while it renders
Feb 22 00:42:21 <ohnoitsnoah>	/
Feb 22 00:42:26 <ohnoitsnoah>	whoops

Feb 22 00:47:39 <bpalmer>	Let's train emacs to kill buffers that don't meet quality standards.
Feb 22 00:50:22 <ohnoitsnoah>	real
Feb 22 00:51:00 <twb>	bpalmer: maybe it could just kill minority buffers
Feb 22 00:51:21 <ohnoitsnoah>	major minor modes joke right hahahahaha.........
Feb 22 00:58:14 <bpalmer>	twb: too many uncommon letters? That's easy enough to write.
Feb 22 00:58:58 <bpalmer>	More than three zs in a row suggest the document is boring.
Feb 22 01:01:24 <twb>	I was actually thinking "minor mode" but whatever
Feb 22 01:03:32 <ohnoitsnoah>	Is there an Emacs drawing extension
Feb 22 01:03:38 <ohnoitsnoah>	who am i kidding of course there is
Feb 22 01:03:42 <ohnoitsnoah>	(probably)
Feb 22 01:04:23 <bpalmer>	,artist-mode
Feb 22 01:04:24 <fsbot>	[->] ArtistMode: [0] included in Emacs 23 and up.
Feb 22 01:04:25 <fsbot>	[1] at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ArtistMode
Feb 22 01:04:25 <fsbot>	[2] can be used to create diagrams together with ditaa
Feb 22 01:05:35 <Thaodan>	there's also plantuml which works well
Feb 22 01:05:52 <ohnoitsnoah>	I accidently left because I turned on artist mode lol
Feb 22 01:07:18 <bpalmer>	plants vs uml is not nearly as exciting as plants vs zombies.

Feb 22 01:19:26 <ohnoitsnoah>	grym: sigh,,,yeah
Feb 22 01:20:01 <e1f>	actually, we are still running emacs 1.29. the 1 was dropped from versioning

Feb 22 01:24:28 <grym>	nah
Feb 22 01:25:58 <ohnoitsnoah>	grym: Nah as in "nah it's not good" or "nah, I haven't tried it"

Feb 22 01:30:11 <ohnoitsnoah>	Have y'all tried any other Emacsen?
Feb 22 01:30:23 <technomancy>	you mean like ... xemacs?
Feb 22 01:31:19 <bremner>	rudybot: country and western
Feb 22 01:31:19 <rudybot>	bremner: And reactionaries would only be listening to country and western

Feb 22 01:31:33 <bremner>	oh, so things _called_ eamcs
Feb 22 01:31:39 <ohnoitsnoah>	yeah lol
Feb 22 01:31:41 <technomancy>	uemacs doesn't even have lisp, right?
Feb 22 01:31:46 <ohnoitsnoah>	no ://
Feb 22 01:31:47 <ohnoitsnoah>	it
Feb 22 01:31:49 <ohnoitsnoah>	it
Feb 22 01:31:58 <ohnoitsnoah>	it's just a boring text editor
Feb 22 01:32:00 <technomancy>	feels wrong to have emacs in the name at all without lisp
Feb 22 01:32:13 <technomancy>	not that I'm against boring editors on principle or anything
Feb 22 01:32:31 <technomancy>	but if you think that you made something kind of like emacs and it doesn't have lisp, you don't know what emacs actually is
Feb 22 01:32:43 <ohnoitsnoah>	yeah I feel you
Feb 22 01:36:13 <mwnaylor>	Killing minors is generally frowned upon. 😜
Feb 22 01:40:08 <bpalmer>	mwnaylor: just wait until you're trapped on a plane with one.
Feb 22 01:41:11 <mwnaylor>	bpalmer: Last time I flew was Easter weekend 2000.
Feb 22 01:49:40 <ohnoitsnoah>	Remember when RMS was like "more WYSIWYG in Emacs" lol
Feb 22 01:50:05 <ecbrown>	it was a good idea
Feb 22 01:50:10 <ecbrown>	still is
Feb 22 01:53:08 <ohnoitsnoah>	I think it would be neat, I just like Emacs for it's all-plain-text kinda experience
Feb 22 01:53:37 <ohnoitsnoah>	I know it's not all in plain-text, but I think you know what I'm getting at lol
Feb 22 02:19:56 <Viking667>	'llo all.
Feb 22 02:21:06 <grym>	Viking667: how's your locationing
Feb 22 02:22:50 <Viking667>	it's a-locationing. We're just getting some other things in place at the moment, the usual things that happen when anyone relocates.
Feb 22 02:24:30 <Viking667>	And I have my first task from someone else - trying to re-enable the touchpad on an HP laptop that runs Windows 11. I have no real experience with Windows past Vista, and currently have a mouse plugged in to help out.
Feb 22 02:27:21 <johnjaye>	Viking667: things changed a lot since vista. i couldn't even get emacs to run on my old vista machine
Feb 22 02:29:00 <twb>	Viking667: recent laptop?
Feb 22 02:29:20 <twb>	It *ought* to be cabled via USB so it *ought* to Just Work with standard built-in drivers...
Feb 22 02:29:37 <twb>	Maybe there's an option to disable it completely in the EFI config?
Feb 22 02:29:38 <johnjaye>	run a linux ubuntu live instance and see if it works with that
Feb 22 02:30:04 <twb>	johnjaye: if that works, it would at least prove it's not a hardware fault
Feb 22 02:30:25 <johnjaye>	yes i did that often. just throw in ubuntu and see if my pc still has the problem
Feb 22 02:30:50 <johnjaye>	now i mostly just dual boot. windows on one drive, linux on second drive.
Feb 22 02:31:09 <johnjaye>	now if only i knew some way to backup my data to an external drive
Feb 22 02:32:30 <incal>	what's going on
Feb 22 02:32:58 <johnjaye>	i suspect i wouldn't get more speed from a usb-c card i have than usb3.0 ports i have.
Feb 22 02:33:15 <johnjaye>	but i don't know how to check that
Feb 22 02:33:42 <johnjaye>	i think i tried with my android phone to test it but the transfer rate was limited by the disk
Feb 22 02:33:52 <johnjaye>	incal: i'm just rambling about usb
Feb 22 02:35:54 <johnjaye>	according to usbview i have an xchi compliant host controller with 8 ports, some usb2 and some usb3
Feb 22 02:36:52 <Viking667>	The touchpad? There's a driver, but it was showing a problem.
Feb 22 02:37:14 <Viking667>	sorry. bit busy here shuffling other priorities. I'll be back later.
Feb 22 02:41:56 <incal>	johnjaye, didn't know of usbview, but it is in the Debian repos so let's install it and try it then
Feb 22 02:42:35 <johnjaye>	ah i can actually use the device id and vendor id to lookup the device and see what it is
Feb 22 02:44:47 <twb>	I use lshw
Feb 22 02:44:55 <twb>	lshw -json
Feb 22 02:45:31 <twb>	Easier than remembering lots of little tools, faster than grepping /sys
Feb 22 02:45:49 <grym>	and fed into the jq maw
Feb 22 02:46:29 <Viking667>	Yah. I can't do that on Windows 11, and this lappy isn't mine. I took a look into the device manager, there's a device listing for a ELAN touchpad, but there's one of those yellow triangles on it.
Feb 22 02:46:52 <johnjaye>	i think ehci just means usb2.0 and xhci means usb3.0
Feb 22 02:46:59 <twb>	johnjaye: correct
Feb 22 02:47:12 <johnjaye>	wikipedia doesn't make it very clear. lol
Feb 22 02:47:35 <johnjaye>	Viking667: the standard windows solution is to uninstall the device from device manager, thenreboot and reinstall the device with a driver.
Feb 22 02:47:36 <twb>	Touchpads were often cabled to PS/2 for a very long time, because i8042 gives you a PS/2 port for free, so that frees up one USB port for external cabling
Feb 22 02:47:43 <incal>	it seems I have three 2.00 and three 3.10. but the only thing connected is a keyboard which is USB 2.00 so maybe there is no point in using a 3.10 for that?
Feb 22 02:47:49 <Viking667>	And here, the device shows up as a PS/2 device, and shows that it's either not plugged in, not working or doesn't have drivers installed
Feb 22 02:48:04 <johnjaye>	incal: doesn't really matter if you have nothing else anyway.
Feb 22 02:48:23 <incal>	what do yo mean?
Feb 22 02:48:24 <twb>	Viking667: the data ribbon might have come loose, but unlikely
Feb 22 02:48:49 <incal>	PS/2, is that still used
Feb 22 02:49:03 <twb>	incal: I don't know if it's still the case in USB4 era
Feb 22 02:49:12 <twb>	incal: but as at early USB3 era (2012), absolutely
Feb 22 02:49:25 <twb>	incal: also "gamer" mice are PS/2 because lower latency
Feb 22 02:49:42 <incal>	usbview, too bad it don't have a text-only option for the output
Feb 22 02:49:50 <incal>	maybe some other tool can do that
Feb 22 02:50:34 <twb>	"just reboot into a Debian Live usb key for 5 minutes"
Feb 22 02:50:55 <incal>	at least the blue and red USB ports look cool on the computer
Feb 22 02:51:10 <twb>	You still have red USB ports?
Feb 22 02:51:44 <twb>	Ah that means USB 3.2
Feb 22 02:51:46 <incal>	I think I have black, blue and red. hm, what color is teal? <https://tripplite.eaton.com/products/usb-connectivity-types-standards>
Feb 22 02:51:56 <twb>	teal = USB 3.1
Feb 22 02:51:56 <incal>	,g What color is teal?
Feb 22 02:51:57 <fsbot>	🤖[g] A shade of blue-green.
Feb 22 02:52:08 <incal>	ah, cyan
Feb 22 02:52:18 <twb>	incal: midori
Feb 22 02:52:35 <twb>	I was thinking of red being the eSATA ports
Feb 22 02:53:06 <twb>	https://svitppt.com.ua/images/22/21129/770/img10.jpg <-- like that
Feb 22 02:53:32 <incal>	according to the tool, I have 3.10, in that table it says 3.1 is either teal or red, 3.0 is blue
Feb 22 02:54:04 <incal>	yellow and orange I haven't seen
Feb 22 02:54:13 <Viking667>	great. I've only ever dealt with the black and blue ones, haven't really seen much of red and none of teal.
Feb 22 02:54:13 <twb>	black tongue = usb 2.0; blue tongue = usb 3.0; teal tongue = usb 3.1; red tongue = usb 3.2; yellow tongue = powered while off
Feb 22 02:55:19 <incal>	it says red "[u]sually denotes an 'always on' port", so I guess one keeps that for safety-critical gear
Feb 22 02:55:51 <incal>	or to charge the smartphone when the computer is off, not that I turn mine off
Feb 22 02:59:39 <incal>	I used to turn the computer off and on because the fan made an annoying noise, so I replaced the fans with high-end ones that were supposedly more quiet, and maybe they were, got a semi-passive PSU and stuff, but nothing helped, still couldn't sleep in the same room with it on, so ultimately I just put in in a box, then it never bothered me again, haha
Feb 22 03:00:03 <incal>	but I guess it was a bummer since after all the tinkering the computer looked really cool
Feb 22 03:08:47 <incal>	also disconnected the fan to the GPU, hasn't overheated yet, all tho sensors(1) reports 'ERROR: Can't get value of subfeature in0_input: Can't read' for some reason, and a similar error for the CPU temp
Feb 22 03:08:55 <incal>	should ask on #debian for that, maybe
Feb 22 03:09:22 <spikemaster>	i plan to never experience fan noise ever again.
Feb 22 03:10:32 <grym>	eeeeeeeee
Feb 22 03:11:24 <twb>	incal: I mean... life critical gear probably shouldn't be on USB in the first place...
Feb 22 03:11:33 <incal>	here is some Elisp to add noise, dB don't add linearly, https://dataswamp.org/~incal/emacs-init/audio.el
Feb 22 03:12:25 <incal>	which is good since if it did people would have problem just by having a bunch of very small noise sources add up
Feb 22 03:15:01 <incal>	so if you have one source of 15 dB, it is 15 dB
Feb 22 03:15:22 <incal>	but if you have two sources of 15 dB, it is 18 dB!
Feb 22 03:16:58 <twb>	Decibels *of what*
Feb 22 03:17:06 <grym>	and relative to what
Feb 22 03:17:10 <incal>	then it falls pretty quickly, 20 for 3, 21 for 4 and so on
Feb 22 03:17:41 <twb>	It's like saying "wow, 2e4 + 1e5 is not 3e9"
Feb 22 03:18:09 <grym>	incal: now do it A-weighted
Feb 22 03:18:15 <twb>	I kind of with dB would just get fucked
Feb 22 03:18:31 <twb>	Unfortunately https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel#Criticism doesn't exist
Feb 22 03:18:46 <grym>	twb: sadly for you, there are plenty of things in the world with huuuuge dynamic range, and your cochlea are on the list
Feb 22 03:19:25 <twb>	grym: sure but like... can you not just say ·eⁿ instead of n dB
Feb 22 03:19:45 <twb>	Or whatever it is exactly since I still don't really "get" it
Feb 22 03:20:24 <grym>	log compression is still handy
Feb 22 03:20:59 <twb>	Unfortunately "decibel considered harmful" and "units considered harmful" are full of health bullshit instead of interesting metrology rants
Feb 22 03:21:23 <twb>	Maybe I need to like search on google scholar and limit to "journal of metrology" or something
Feb 22 03:22:43 <twb>	Let's question societal norms about what appliances every kitchen needs.
Feb 22 03:22:54 <incal>	so if one wants to reduce noise, start with what makes tho most noise. which is the way a kid would solve the problem as well, so it is pretty intuitive :)
Feb 22 03:23:16 <grym>	also, start with reducing noise that you hear best
Feb 22 03:23:18 <twb>	incal: "if your house was on fire, what would you take out first?"  "The fire"
Feb 22 03:23:44 <grym>	i do not care at all if i have a fan that's howling away at 90dB SPL ... at 22 kHz
Feb 22 03:23:56 <grym>	well, at least my ears don't care
Feb 22 03:23:59 <twb>	grym: it can't fuck up your ears?
Feb 22 03:24:04 <grym>	twb: it can't, no
Feb 22 03:24:08 <twb>	grym: because like... UV can fuck up your eues even if you can't "see" it
Feb 22 03:24:16 <grym>	not the same
Feb 22 03:24:22 <twb>	fair enough
Feb 22 03:24:25 <grym>	see also: infrasound nutters
Feb 22 03:24:39 <grym>	which is the same thing but other side
Feb 22 03:25:15 <grym>	ThE wInD tUrBiNeS!  ... bruh
Feb 22 03:25:31 <twb>	Our approach so far has mainly been 1) fine drivers who continue to illegally use beepers instead of squakers; 2) relocate residents when the TBM is running.
Feb 22 03:26:06 <incal>	if you are in a forest or on a beach all the noise makes you calm, but a computer fan can be irritating as hell
Feb 22 03:27:04 <johnjaye>	i think i figured it out. i have 5 usb controllers in total. the usb2 on front and back have different controllers. the usb3 has 2 sets on the back, 2 different controllers. and i have an addon card giving me a 5th controller.
Feb 22 03:27:35 <twb>	incal: doesn't make ME calm
Feb 22 03:27:47 <twb>	fucken bears having sex in the next tree or whatever
Feb 22 03:27:58 <weary-traveler>	rudybot: drop bears??
Feb 22 03:27:58 <rudybot>	weary-traveler: Did they make you wear a pointy hat to ward off the drop bears
Feb 22 03:27:58 <fsbot>	Probably!
Feb 22 03:29:35 <grym>	little johnny ursa, we call him
Feb 22 03:29:46 <weary-traveler>	heh
Feb 22 03:30:22 <grym>	hodapp: what weaksauce https://status.openai.com/incidents/ssg8fh7sfyz3
Feb 22 03:34:19 <weary-traveler>	i wouldn't have thought gpu configurations to affect correctness. interesting
Feb 22 03:34:33 <grym>	it's so high level that it doesn't mean anything
Feb 22 03:35:12 <weary-traveler>	that's par for the course
Feb 22 03:36:45 <twb>	I was looking at "open-source self-hosted backup for your smartphone's photos" yesterday, and on their news page said "the face recognition code can now use cuda acceleration on supported GPUs"
Feb 22 03:37:04 <twb>	And I was like "what part of 'backup' needs you do do 'ai face recognition'"
Feb 22 03:37:36 <weary-traveler>	the part that calls to the five/nie/however-many eyes
Feb 22 03:41:55 <weary-traveler>	rudybot: is it time to split up my ~1mb org file? or should i put it off another year?
Feb 22 03:41:56 <rudybot>	weary-traveler: Moving through a buffer below 1MB should be fast.
Feb 22 03:42:19 <weary-traveler>	well yes
Feb 22 03:46:04 <grym>	and at what year are you in that bragging that you have cuda support is even remotely worth mentioning
Feb 22 03:47:08 <hodapp>	grym: yeah I was hoping they'd say more
Feb 22 03:47:29 <weary-traveler>	i imagine the original message had many more details and by the time it was deemed ready to publish by others in the chain what was retained were a few phrases like cuda, kernels
Feb 22 03:51:06 <bpalmer>	Are we using cuda support to make moving through buffers faster?
Feb 22 03:51:48 <incal>	too much GPU fan noise from that
Feb 22 03:51:49 <bpalmer>	... are we getting vectorized multiple cursor support?
Feb 22 03:52:30 <bpalmer>	I will say, transpose-regions is not a friendly api to work with.
Feb 22 03:52:34 <hodapp>	are you getting jealous of Zed?
Feb 22 03:52:57 <Guest76>	incal like this ?  https://devhumor.com/media/my-fans
Feb 22 03:53:46 <incal>	yuk! no, it was more like annoying, not disgusting
Feb 22 03:53:57 <grym>	hodapp: mmm, nah
Feb 22 03:55:06 <bpalmer>	twb: but certainly, you could see the potential benefits: photographs of family should be replicated to more locations over a higher priority network, whereas photos of the inside of your pockets can be replicated to 0 locations.
Feb 22 03:55:32 <Guest76>	incal sorry. I never thought that someone can find that disgusting
Feb 22 03:55:37 <twb>	bpalmer: that seems to be making unreasonable assumptions
Feb 22 03:55:46 <twb>	It's not like my family is in my Dunbar group
Feb 22 03:56:46 <bpalmer>	twb: but surely if you had to make a choice, you'd pocket veto pocket pics over visions of humanity?
Feb 22 03:58:15 <twb>	My smartphone camera has literally never once taken a photo of a human
Feb 22 03:58:45 <grym>	counterpoint: you're an extreme outlier
Feb 22 03:58:47 <twb>	It is sort of amusing to watch its edge detection diagnose a tap ("faucet") as a human head
Feb 22 03:58:59 <twb>	grym: sure, but that's what I meant about making assumptions
Feb 22 03:59:08 <grym>	twb: it's fair to make assumptions that discard outliers
Feb 22 03:59:11 <twb>	It's basically saying "minorities don't matter"
Feb 22 03:59:13 <incal>	,g Do it today, in a different way
Feb 22 03:59:24 <grym>	if you insist
Feb 22 03:59:40 <bpalmer>	I suspect face recognition is likely going to work on non-human entities as well without need to retrain.
Feb 22 03:59:58 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Don't delay, innovate away!
Feb 22 04:00:01 <grym>	bpalmer: it may or may not; depends how you set it up
Feb 22 04:00:03 <bpalmer>	Not as well, maybe, but many dogs look distinct, for example.
Feb 22 04:00:09 <grym>	sometimes in pretty bad ways :D
Feb 22 04:00:21 <grym>	bpalmer: some of them are hotdogs!
Feb 22 04:00:29 <bpalmer>	big eyes. big nose. hairy.
Feb 22 04:00:32 <bpalmer>	basically a person.
Feb 22 04:00:42 <grym>	yeaaah google photos thought so too
Feb 22 04:00:47 <grym>	but with black people and gorillas
Feb 22 04:01:08 <bpalmer>	ah, yes.
Feb 22 04:01:20 <grym>	their solution to that particular whoopsie was pretty hamfisted: they deleted the gorilla class
Feb 22 04:01:34 <grym>	which, well.  okay...
Feb 22 04:01:47 <hodapp>	this is reminding me of the episode of Better Off Ted that is... not even all that-farfetched
Feb 22 04:01:56 <bpalmer>	I always knew class warfare was inevitable.
Feb 22 04:02:10 <grym>	farfetched: a word that sounds like it ought to be yiddish, yet, is not
Feb 22 04:02:30 <hodapp>	the company puts these newfangled presence sensors all over the building for things like doors and lights and even water fountains, and then they discover that the sensors don't work on black people.
Feb 22 04:02:38 <weary-traveler>	i miss that show
Feb 22 04:02:43 <incal>	when AI takes over, maybe there will be a class war between first and second class computers
Feb 22 04:02:57 <hodapp>	their solution was to have separate facilities for black people.
Feb 22 04:03:12 <hodapp>	so as to be inclusive.
Feb 22 04:03:18 <weary-traveler>	the "solution" iirc was to pair a white guy with a black guy
Feb 22 04:03:25 <weary-traveler>	to ensure visibility to sensors
Feb 22 04:03:26 <hodapp>	oh yeah I forgot about that part
Feb 22 04:03:40 <incal>	maybe really pretty girls will have the sensors overheat as well
Feb 22 04:04:00 <bpalmer>	So Zed is apparently by the creators of Atom.
Feb 22 04:04:11 <hodapp>	bpalmer: yes. https://zed.dev/blog/we-have-to-start-over
Feb 22 04:04:19 <weary-traveler>	is zed another editor?
Feb 22 04:04:23 <grym>	bpalmer: it is, yes
Feb 22 04:04:34 <hodapp>	weary-traveler: yeah. shiny and Rust-based
Feb 22 04:04:43 <habamax>	same fate as atom, probably
Feb 22 04:04:46 <grym>	and macos only and has a data ... policy ...?
Feb 22 04:04:51 <hodapp>	grym: wut
Feb 22 04:07:29 <grym>	hodapp: if you use their codesharing stuff the EULA has the usual boilerplate about user data
Feb 22 04:33:06 <grym>	i can't say i'm very enthused to give it a try
Feb 22 04:46:50 <shrysr>	.
Feb 22 04:47:30 <grym>	..
Feb 22 04:52:17 <incal>	...
Feb 22 04:52:34 <incal>	C-u .
Feb 22 04:52:42 <incal>	AKA ....
Feb 22 04:55:14 <ohnoitsnoah>	Howdyy
Feb 22 05:17:27 <e1f>	let's play a game where we try to find how many modes can be enabled before emacs is unusable as the modes begin to conflict with each other
Feb 22 05:20:32 <Guest76>	I really often wonder about how emacs can handles my stupidities, that other programs scared for live
Feb 22 05:20:36 <ecbrown>	there are no conflicts in the 400 packages loaded in my spacemacs
Feb 22 05:21:25 <ecbrown>	emacs enables stupidities
Feb 22 05:27:32 <spikemaster>	i tried Zed for a bit. the Vim emulation is a bit lacking. The Vim commands don't take numeric argumentss. Evil mode does a better job covering more wierd Vim quirks.
Feb 22 05:28:02 <incal>	ecbrown, what is a package, something you `require'?
Feb 22 05:30:56 <ecbrown>	incal: a package brings extra functionality into emacs.
Feb 22 05:31:25 <ecbrown>	it can be required and/or load-file'd or any number of mechanisms for loading
Feb 22 05:34:07 <incal>	if we stick to `require', I use 159 using this command to find out: grep -h -o '(require .*)' **/*.el | sort | uniq | wc -l
Feb 22 05:34:40 <ecbrown>	why sort | uniq
Feb 22 05:34:51 <ecbrown>	why not just uniq
Feb 22 05:35:52 <ecbrown>	think of all those lost cpu cycles that could have been used for good
Feb 22 05:35:58 <incal>	see uniq(1), "Note: 'uniq' does not detect repeated lines unless they are  adjacent. You may want to sort the input first, or use 'sort -u' without 'uniq'."
Feb 22 05:36:31 <incal>	right, one can drop uniq
Feb 22 05:36:33 <ecbrown>	incal: wow, that's quite a gotcha
Feb 22 05:36:49 <ecbrown>	so you can drop the uniq, but not the sort!
Feb 22 05:36:58 <incal>	indeed, grep -h -o '(require .*)' **/*.el | sort -u
Feb 22 05:37:02 <incal>	also 159
Feb 22 05:37:05 <ecbrown>	:-)
Feb 22 05:38:23 <incal>	as for what you said initially as to not having any collisions, I have also not have had any problems whatsoever with that all these years
Feb 22 05:42:08 <spikemaster>	Zed seems to have silently uninstalled itself from my computer. I think that's about it for me and Zed then. I was wary going in, and now my trust is completely gone.
Feb 22 05:52:02 <e1f>	it's an unwinnable game, then
Feb 22 05:54:13 <bpalmer>	how about a nice game of chess?
Feb 22 05:54:50 <corwin>	maybe later, right now let's play global-thermal-nuclear-mode
Feb 22 05:56:12 <bpalmer>	It's very sad that emacs can't order two first class tickets to Paris before the bombings start.
Feb 22 05:59:08 <johnjaye>	if your life was determined by how many emacs commands you could remember, what would you do?
Feb 22 05:59:19 <johnjaye>	waste time partying, or study the manual constantly?
Feb 22 06:00:23 <bpalmer>	Get really good at defining new emacs commands.
Feb 22 06:02:16 <ecbrown>	party while studying the manual?  been there done that
Feb 22 06:04:51 <bpalmer>	Does it count as remembering if something is created as you think of it? I feel like the Prince Who Was a Thousand has a relevant question here.
Feb 22 06:05:28 <incal>	do people really read the manual?
Feb 22 06:05:34 <ecbrown>	yes
Feb 22 06:06:11 <ecbrown>	i have a bound copy from fsf store
Feb 22 06:06:35 <incal>	I also has a bound copy, but it is for Emacs 18
Feb 22 06:07:32 <corwin>	I have that one, and 27.1
Feb 22 06:08:17 <ecbrown>	i wish the store kept up with most current release, perhaps print-on-demand
Feb 22 06:08:35 <ecbrown>	i'd probably buy a copy every release
Feb 22 06:08:46 <corwin>	That would be cool.  I've been pushing for a new set of print manuals for Emacs 30.1 but TBH
Feb 22 06:08:53 <corwin>	erm, TBD, I mean.
Feb 22 06:09:54 <shrysr>	Yes I do read the manual. In Emacs.
Feb 22 06:10:11 <codingquark>	Good morning!
Feb 22 06:10:20 <corwin>	Good morning codingquark :D
Feb 22 06:10:20 <shrysr>	Yo
Feb 22 06:10:24 <Guest76>	I've read emacs manuals for 3 versions but after > 10 years still halfway in the included elisp tutorial.
Feb 22 06:10:29 <codingquark>	Hey corwin!
Feb 22 06:10:34 <codingquark>	Hey shrysr!
Feb 22 06:10:40 <codingquark>	How are you guys?
Feb 22 06:10:42 <ecbrown>	Guest76: i'm not a fan of the elisp tutorial
Feb 22 06:11:32 <Guest76>	me neither. I learned from other sources but still try once in a while to finish it
Feb 22 06:12:32 <shrysr>	Chilling out codingquark all fine. How are you doing?
Feb 22 06:13:02 <codingquark>	I'm well thank you!
Feb 22 06:13:27 <shrysr>	☺️
Feb 22 06:13:43 <incal>	I just used the docstrings
Feb 22 06:15:01 <shrysr>	Buffers auto correct to buggers on iOS.
Feb 22 06:15:10 <corwin>	Doing okay.  Kinda a tough week but hanging in here.
Feb 22 06:15:29 <twb>	shrysr: I think if you shout at it enough, it learns to stop correcting you
Feb 22 06:16:00 <shrysr>	Ima rooting for you corwin hang tight.
Feb 22 06:16:13 <corwin>	thanks m8
Feb 22 06:16:22 <incal>	love and pain, it never stays the same
Feb 22 06:17:39 <twb>	"I might go for a walk" steps outside, 38°C, fire ban, "or maybe not"

Feb 22 06:21:02 <twb>	weary-traveler: no beekeeping at all today
Feb 22 06:21:42 <weary-traveler>	maximum masochistic effort
Feb 22 06:22:17 <weary-traveler>	twb: so is smoking a cigarette not permitted either?
Feb 22 06:22:25 <twb>	I actually was trying to work that out
Feb 22 06:22:40 <twb>	It sounds like the cigarette itself isn't regulated if it's in your mouth, but if you drop it, or drop a match, then you go to gaol
Feb 22 06:23:24 <codingquark>	https://blog.peerdb.io/moving-a-billion-postgres-rows-on-a-100-budget interesting
Feb 22 06:23:25 <twb>	https://www.nsw.gov.au/news/tough-new-penalties-for-lit-cigarette-tossers
Feb 22 06:24:03 <codingquark>	twb: what's posing increased fire risk?
Feb 22 06:24:23 <twb>	Hm?
Feb 22 06:24:53 <codingquark>	what happened that .au now says "look we gonna catch fire, do as we say or else"?
Feb 22 06:24:56 <weary-traveler>	what's a gas-powered wildlife scare gun? a blowtorch? or air rifle? or something else entirely?
Feb 22 06:25:12 <weary-traveler>	codingquark: i'm guessing summer
Feb 22 06:25:16 <twb>	weary-traveler: I think from context it's basically a two-stroke engine that deliberately backfires
Feb 22 06:25:39 <twb>	codingquark: "total fire ban" days are completely normal in summer
Feb 22 06:25:56 <twb>	codingquark: basically any time there is wind + dry + hot
Feb 22 06:26:19 <codingquark>	twb: I get >40C here, but nothing catches fire. Is it because I don't have forests (got some vegetation, farms etc) or something else?
Feb 22 06:26:23 <twb>	"You can smoke outside. Flicking a lit cigarette out of a car window during a total fire ban is illegal and attracts a fine." https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-30/total-fire-bans-explained-for-city-dwellers/8220210
Feb 22 06:26:40 <twb>	codingquark: maybe you don't have a lot of dry vegetation there
Feb 22 06:27:30 <twb>	codingquark: in Australia a lot of planets expect like 3-8 years of drought in a row, and a huge fire in that time, and they need the fire as part of their seed cycle
Feb 22 06:27:33 <twb>	*plants
Feb 22 06:28:26 <twb>	codingquark: it used to be especially bad in NSW.au because they did not have controlled burns policy for 20 years, so they basically had a big backlog of burnable vegetation that was waiting to burn
Feb 22 06:28:47 <codingquark>	hmm... I got lots of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopis_juliflora everywhere, mangroves in coastal area and farms
Feb 22 06:29:08 <weary-traveler>	coastal areas may not have low enough humidity
Feb 22 06:29:21 <twb>	codingquark: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksia#Response_to_fire
Feb 22 06:29:27 <codingquark>	twb: oh I see! They are adapted to fire! Yea plants here are totally not like that
Feb 22 06:29:42 <twb>	Kind of like a phoenix
Feb 22 06:29:59 <shrysr>	For something to spontaneously combust you require sufficient time temperature and turbulence.
Feb 22 06:30:31 <weary-traveler>	australia: where everything is trying to kill you and plants are like phoenix. come visit.
Feb 22 06:30:35 <twb>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn#History
Feb 22 06:30:42 <codingquark>	he he he
Feb 22 06:31:07 <twb>	This is different from slash-and-burn agriculture where you clear a forest by burning it down, bulldozing the ashes, and then planting rice or sugarcane
Feb 22 06:31:23 <bpalmer>	California has similar plants adapted to fire cycles (and similarly suffers from people who ignored that and kept major fires from burning for 80-100 years)
Feb 22 06:31:53 <codingquark>	plants figured out what to do during fires, but we did not
Feb 22 06:32:02 <codingquark>	now who's more intelligent huh?
Feb 22 06:32:07 <twb>	Definitely one of those cases where the whitefellas were like "well shucks I guess you savages had some tribal wisdom after all"
Feb 22 06:32:08 <weary-traveler>	well they don't usually move
Feb 22 06:32:25 <codingquark>	twb: :'D
Feb 22 06:32:33 <twb>	codingquark: well most trees cannot outrun a fire
Feb 22 06:32:44 <twb>	Even mangrove
Feb 22 06:33:04 <codingquark>	they cannot even move and yet they figured it out
Feb 22 06:33:18 <twb>	Mangoves can move a bit IIRC
Feb 22 06:33:27 <codingquark>	what really?
Feb 22 06:33:49 <codingquark>	,g can mangoves move a little bit?
Feb 22 06:33:50 <fsbot>	🤖[g] Only if they really want to branch out!
Feb 22 06:35:07 <codingquark>	May be the bot should a bit more like a computer than a damn human
Feb 22 06:35:54 <shrysr>	I think there are plants that move in the desert
Feb 22 06:37:07 <twb>	codingquark: OK I may be thinking of https://www.livescience.com/33663-walking-tree-socratea-exorrhiza.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratea_exorrhiza
Feb 22 06:37:19 <twb>	codingquark: and the general consensus there is "lol, no, u idiot, they don't actually walk"
Feb 22 06:37:26 <bpalmer>	twb: I don't know that tribes in California were particularly in a position to *stop* the fires, nor that they particularly tried.
Feb 22 06:37:33 <bpalmer>	tried either which way.
Feb 22 06:37:47 <codingquark>	twb: yea, internet search so far tells me they move because of external forces /perhaps/
Feb 22 06:38:02 <twb>	bpalmer: fire management was absolutely A Thing for the Boonwurrung
Feb 22 06:38:11 <twb>	bpalmer: that's not exactly the same as "stop fires"
Feb 22 06:38:22 <incal>	,g Where have all the flowers gone?
Feb 22 06:38:24 <fsbot>	🤖[g] To the land of mulch and decay!

Feb 22 06:38:42 <twb>	first hit: https://indigenousknowledge.unimelb.edu.au/curriculum/resources/fire-and-land-management-past-and-present
Feb 22 06:38:48 <codingquark>	bpalmer: is "either which way" a normally used phrase? I have noticed people speaking certain .in languages use it often but not the people of .us
Feb 22 06:39:10 <bpalmer>	Mostly, I get annoyed by unsupported assertions that "the native tribes lived in harmony with nature" when it often seems more like "they just didn't have the technology and numbers to mess it up as much"
Feb 22 06:39:12 <twb>	bpalmer: Boonwurrung and Woi Wurrung were part of the Kulin Alliance down along the Birrarrung
Feb 22 06:39:23 <twb>	Nyungar are out west
Feb 22 06:39:32 <incal>	I think that is what they mean :)
Feb 22 06:39:45 <codingquark>	bpalmer: my impression has been that they've been living in a mix
Feb 22 06:40:14 <incal>	if people can do it, they will
Feb 22 06:40:14 <codingquark>	Most of the time they have told me "just don't" and didn't know why or cared
Feb 22 06:40:16 <bpalmer>	codingquark: I say "either which way" a lot.

Feb 22 06:41:01 <codingquark>	are APIs still not fixed by openai or is this prompt engg at play here?
Feb 22 06:42:58 <bpalmer>	I don't see any particular note on a few quick searches that it's a regionalism.
Feb 22 06:43:21 <codingquark>	I see
Feb 22 06:46:07 <codingquark>	I was tempted to get anno 1800 but reviews said I'll be buying more and more dlcs - so avoided
Feb 22 06:46:55 <twb>	It's ubisoft innit
Feb 22 06:47:16 <codingquark>	yea
Feb 22 06:47:25 <twb>	I remember that one because it's region-locked so I can't fully ignore it (can't ignore the ones for other regions)
Feb 22 06:47:54 <twb>	Oh "Anno 1800" is the reboot
Feb 22 06:48:11 <codingquark>	there are other reboots with different years
Feb 22 06:48:48 <twb>	https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?query=Anno&refinementList%5Btags%5D%5B0%5D=City%20Builder
Feb 22 06:49:27 <twb>	Anno 1404 is scoring higher than Anno 1800, according to whatever random bullshit votes are worth
Feb 22 06:49:46 <codingquark>	I see!
Feb 22 06:50:06 <codingquark>	It might also be "just like" Civ5 et el
Feb 22 06:50:37 <twb>	Dyson is scoring above Factorio: https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Btags%5D%5B0%5D=City%20Builder&refinementList%5Btags%5D%5B1%5D=Strategy&refinementList%5Btags%5D%5B2%5D=Resource%20Management
Feb 22 06:50:38 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/TibGSL20ZV
Feb 22 06:50:42 <codingquark>	Like I play Civ5 and Stellaris, they both feel basically the same
Feb 22 06:51:13 <twb>	Those are more "4X" than "City Builder"
Feb 22 06:51:44 <twb>	I generally don't like city builders, but I mostly liked the frozen earth ring city one
Feb 22 06:51:52 <codingquark>	hmm
Feb 22 06:51:58 <twb>	Frost Punk
Feb 22 06:52:16 <codingquark>	dyson over factorio! :O
Feb 22 06:53:12 <twb>	I have "The Wandering Village" on my todo list, but "Timberborn" I threw out
Feb 22 06:53:38 <codingquark>	damn steamdb not opening here
Feb 22 06:54:28 <twb>	"Kingdom" series is pretty cool, it's basically a 1-dimensional city builder
Feb 22 06:55:07 <codingquark>	people telling me to try out baldur's gate 3 as well
Feb 22 06:55:09 <twb>	You can only go left/right and Bad Guys come from both sides, so initially it's fine, but eventually you can't run to the other edge before the Bad Guys win
Feb 22 06:55:36 <twb>	Yeah BG3 looks super good but personally I'm more looking at like https://store.steampowered.com/app/1571940/Ctrl_Alt_Ego/
Feb 22 06:55:42 <incal>	are we talking video games?
Feb 22 06:55:47 <twb>	incal: yeah
Feb 22 06:56:24 <codingquark>	twb: hmm... this looks interesting
Feb 22 06:56:46 <twb>	I am 100% "that annoying indie hipster guy" when it comes to video games
Feb 22 06:58:23 <codingquark>	I noticed that from your steam play :P
Feb 22 07:00:12 *	twb looks guiltily at >1000 hours in Fallout 4
Feb 22 07:00:34 <twb>	Although some of that is because steam used to count "I put the computer to sleep without stopping the game" as "you played aaaaaaall night"
Feb 22 07:01:01 <codingquark>	he he he
Feb 22 07:01:06 <codingquark>	what percentage?
Feb 22 07:01:25 <twb>	Of my total play time of all games?
Feb 22 07:02:38 <codingquark>	no, of those 1k hours
Feb 22 07:02:47 <codingquark>	damn that's a lot of hours man
Feb 22 07:03:07 <twb>	I can't know
Feb 22 07:03:12 <codingquark>	hmm
Feb 22 07:03:40 <twb>	I used to leave it running because it took too long to start up on a 15W computer
Feb 22 07:04:37 <codingquark>	I am thinking of getting a console, purely based on cost-to-performance ratio
Feb 22 07:05:26 <twb>	I mean, if you mostly play mainstream/recent games, then xbox games pass looks like pretty good value-for-money
Feb 22 07:06:16 <twb>	But I'm really pretty dubious about x86_64 consoles in general being other than "_slightly_ cheaper PC"
Feb 22 07:07:14 <twb>	I was much more interested in consoles when they were all POWER architecture, and the console vendors were throwing money at lots of indie developers, and also when "just download the game" wasn't an option because, like, dialup
Feb 22 07:08:25 <codingquark>	that is true... perhaps they're planning new models with ARM architecture
Feb 22 07:08:34 <codingquark>	in which case, I will be sad once again
Feb 22 07:08:39 <twb>	Oh huh, Cult of the Lamb was partly funded by my taxes
Feb 22 07:08:56 <twb>	codingquark: well that's basically Switch innit
Feb 22 07:09:04 <twb>	codingquark: and failed things like tegra and ouya
Feb 22 07:09:16 <incal>	$ units -t '1000 hours' days
Feb 22 07:09:19 <incal>	41.666667
Feb 22 07:09:50 <incal>	so it is not that long if you plan to live to old age
Feb 22 07:10:11 <codingquark>	twb: fair point. those are not powerful at all either. like you cannot enjoy the fancy graphics of modern games
Feb 22 07:10:37 <codingquark>	incal: if you play every single day for 3h a day avg...
Feb 22 07:11:24 <incal>	... then you play for 21h a week avg
Feb 22 07:12:06 <twb>	codingquark: who caaaaaaaaares
Feb 22 07:12:10 <incal>	I would also like a PS5 just to marvel at the technology but I don't think I would play a lot
Feb 22 07:12:39 <twb>	I really do not give any shits about seeing dirt in the pores of some B-grade hollywood actor's digital likeness
Feb 22 07:12:43 <codingquark>	yea I totally do not play enough games to justify most of the cost
Feb 22 07:13:18 <incal>	do people still chip the consoles and download games free of charge?
Feb 22 07:13:23 <codingquark>	I end up thinking more like "I got this much cash, do I really want to spend Y on this thing?" which is not really a great approach
Feb 22 07:13:42 <twb>	incal: I think the monetization system means that like... if you care enough to do that, you would just buy a PC
Feb 22 07:13:47 <incal>	just spend it what you like the most
Feb 22 07:13:56 <twb>	incal: consoles aren't sold at a loss since PS2
Feb 22 07:14:14 <twb>	incal: because Sony went "oh shit people just buy 500 PS2s to make a beowulf cluster, and 0 games"
Feb 22 07:15:12 <twb>	Buying a current-gen xbox today: $800.  Buying a generic PC today: $500 - $1500.
Feb 22 07:15:13 <codingquark>	damn dude xbox game pass has sniper elite 5. I thought it would have other less attractive games
Feb 22 07:15:25 <incal>	if you buy every new generation of consoles I guess it is a hefty price but if you just buy one every 5 years it isn't a lot, unless you spend a lot on buying new games all the time
Feb 22 07:15:56 <codingquark>	No KSP though
Feb 22 07:16:04 <incal>	shooting stuff is fun, I wonder if it has good RPGs as well. or maybe it was a kid thing to be into those
Feb 22 07:16:22 <twb>	PS5 trigger haptics are allegedly good, but I've seen a lot of PS gimmicks
Feb 22 07:16:25 <incal>	to emotional today maybe, even
Feb 22 07:16:40 <twb>	Nobody ever did anythign useful with the PS3 gyro sensors
Feb 22 07:16:48 <codingquark>	twb: even with AMD GPUs, wouldn't a comparably capable system to xbox x will cost about US$200 more?
Feb 22 07:16:56 <twb>	steam controller's gyro sensors were also allegedly super good
Feb 22 07:17:13 <twb>	codingquark: that's... not my impression
Feb 22 07:17:27 <incal>	also a lot of mor trouble installing stuff and applying patches and stuff
Feb 22 07:17:34 <twb>	codingquark: last time I priced it, the price difference was more like -$50 to $150 depending on how much you were prepared to shop around
Feb 22 07:17:49 <codingquark>	I see!
Feb 22 07:18:15 <twb>	codingquark: you could build an overall better gaming rig for $500 instead of $800, if you really worked at it and knew what you were doing
Feb 22 07:18:24 <incal>	I wonder if the PS5 will drop in price a lot 2-3 years from now
Feb 22 07:18:47 <twb>	Not a *much better* rig, but like "a bit better"
Feb 22 07:19:11 <codingquark>	twb: right... I expect guys at MS and sony already did the exercise
Feb 22 07:19:12 <incal>	young people having wonderful adventures in fancy clothes onboard air ships fighting dragons
Feb 22 07:19:16 <incal>	*envious*
Feb 22 07:19:23 <codingquark>	And they are charging a bit more because they did the work for me
Feb 22 07:19:26 <twb>	Really good stuff was $1000-$2000, or more than that if you wanted VR or cockpit sim stuff
Feb 22 07:19:52 <twb>	codingquark: yeah plus brand awareness plus economies of scale
Feb 22 07:21:02 <twb>	I went from Xbox 360 to NUC8i7HVK and I'm very happy with that upgrade, although I've never bothered to run VR on it.
Feb 22 07:21:59 <twb>	I'm only just now getting to the point where some new 100GB games don't run well on "medium" settings at 2560x1440
Feb 22 07:22:02 <codingquark>	twb: for VR, I think we probably will stop relying on computers. People seem to really prefer standalone devices
Feb 22 07:22:40 <twb>	codingquark: heat dissipation issues & shit
Feb 22 07:24:01 <twb>	select 1.0 * time / (select sum(time) from games) from games where name = 'Fallout 4'; → 0.0955398317800752
Feb 22 07:24:04 <twb>	Pretty sure that's a lie
Feb 22 07:25:41 <Rue>	jew
Feb 22 07:26:11 <Rue>	oops wrong channel. was actually trying to highlight a friend xD
Feb 22 07:28:10 <codingquark>	anybody here playing multiplayer? I would like to get into "playing with friends"
Feb 22 07:28:28 <codingquark>	aidalgol used to, but haven't seen him around in a long time
Feb 22 07:31:04 <twb>	He got matrix and then stopped using irc
Feb 22 07:31:21 <twb>	I'm really not a multiplayer person
Feb 22 07:31:41 <twb>	codingquark: for multiplayer have you seen that one that's "Space Tarkov" ?

Feb 22 07:35:17 <twb>	Tarkov is basically an invite-only game where you have to use a bad menu system very quickly or you get shot.
Feb 22 07:35:36 <codingquark>	weird
Feb 22 07:35:39 <twb>	Marauders is basically that, but with steampunk WWII spaceships instead of ukranian STALKER
Feb 22 07:36:01 <codingquark>	I played some among us with strangers at a tea stall :P
Feb 22 07:36:15 <twb>	It's really fun but only useful if you actually have a possé
Feb 22 07:36:35 <codingquark>	hmm
Feb 22 07:40:50 <twb>	It looks like Tarkov doesn't correctly model that when you're a soldier, spare batteries are even more important than soft toilet paper
Feb 22 07:41:55 <codingquark>	I was playing disco elysium on my laptop, and it used to get too damn hot. I want to get back to that amazeballs game
Feb 22 07:42:21 <codingquark>	not starting it because of heat trouble. either terrible frame rates or heat

Feb 22 07:50:45 <codingquark>	:P
Feb 22 07:53:53 <twb>	I'm surprised when people are room-clearing in tarkov they don't switch to a sidearm
Feb 22 08:04:45 <bkhl>	The fact that twitch games are all at the core you fighting against a suboptimal UI is basically why I never play them.
Feb 22 08:05:37 <codingquark>	what are twitch games?
Feb 22 08:06:01 <codingquark>	games played by people on twitch?
Feb 22 08:14:34 <twb>	codingquark: anything with a lot of jump scares for the actor to comically overreact to
Feb 22 08:16:06 <codingquark>	ah
Feb 22 08:16:40 <twb>	Tarkov isn't really "about" navigating deliberately-bad menus quickly, it's just that if you watch anyone experienced playing it, you can see maximizing situational awareness is key
Feb 22 08:17:23 <twb>	Because there's usually some other asshole around the corner waiting for you to try on a corpse's sneakers and pick that moment to kill you and take BOTH pairs

Feb 22 09:38:16 <codingquark>	let's fire marketing team
Feb 22 09:59:15 <graywolf>	Hello.  I am trying to tidy my init.el a bit, and I found outline-minor-mode and hs-minor-mode.  They seems to do similar thing, so I am not sure which one to use.  When would one use one or the other?
Feb 22 09:59:42 <twb>	graywolf: whichever one you hate least
Feb 22 10:00:01 <twb>	"hs-minor-mode" appears to be third-party, and since I hate third-party, I'd personally go for the former
Feb 22 10:00:05 <agent314>	yeah just try one then try another
Feb 22 10:00:50 *	agent314 just had to nuke everything: emacs, doom then build emacs from sources, then reinstall doom 
Feb 22 10:01:18 <graywolf>	Both come with the emacs, that is why I am considering these two
Feb 22 10:01:30 <graywolf>	I guess I will just try, thanks :)
Feb 22 10:02:00 <twb>	codingquark: this is why there are total fire ban days:  20:00 <xxx> wow. 1000 fireys fighting a huge fire near ballarat and beaufort
Feb 22 10:05:18 <agent314>	so apparently specifying --with-pgtk in my configure means DOOM is now going to scream about it being unsupported and how it will crash everything every time i start emacs
Feb 22 10:07:13 <Null_A>	noze: https://imgur.com/a/OnWpN9J
Feb 22 10:08:07 <agent314>	please somebody tell me i dont have to rebuild everything --without-pgtk and --with-x-toolkit
Feb 22 10:11:31 <codingquark>	twb: oh!
Feb 22 10:12:06 <thuna`>	graywolf: Just taking a quick look at hs-minor-mode, it seems like it has fewer features than outline.  On the other hand, it has all the features and I personally like how hs-minor-mode keeps the closing parenthesis.  I think if it kept the docstrings when hiding all I would consider it but as it stands if I make the switch I'll need to re-train my muscle memory so I'll stick with outline.
Feb 22 10:12:27 <thuna`>	s/all the features/all the features that I use/
Feb 22 10:15:19 <graywolf>	Hm, it looks like for C the hideshow pretty much does what I would like out of the box.  For init.el (with sooo many top level forms), it really does not.  I need to check if there is some alternative to outline-regexp variable to tweak the folds.
Feb 22 10:15:58 <thuna`>	graywolf: hs-block-start-regexp
Feb 22 10:16:34 <graywolf>	Ah, thanks :)
Feb 22 10:18:18 <Viking667>	Aaaaanyhow, I'm out of here for the night. I'm having trouble concentrating again.
Feb 22 10:18:50 <graywolf>	Hm, I see.  So while outline mode folds only based on the start of the region, hideshows seems to be for use with balanced blocks (hs-block-{start,end}-regexp).
Feb 22 10:18:56 <thuna`>	Viking667: bye
Feb 22 10:19:24 <graywolf>	So if I just want to fold "^;;;;+ ", outline seems to be the one to use
Feb 22 10:19:38 <thuna`>	graywolf: Yeah, it seems to be optimized for lisp
Feb 22 10:19:51 <graywolf>	thuna`: Thanks :)
Feb 22 10:19:53 <thuna`>	There's hs-hide-comments-when-hiding-all as well
Feb 22 11:05:26 <paul424>	Hello, hello, what mode for html5 ?
Feb 22 11:06:48 <dminuoso>	I just use web-mode
Feb 22 11:08:25 <paul424>	The major mode is HTML+ mode defined in mhtml-mode.el:
Feb 22 11:08:25 <paul424>	Major mode based on ‘html-mode’, but works with embedded JS and CSS.
Feb 22 11:08:47 <paul424>	hmm when I look for number of bindings this mode looks rather .... humble
Feb 22 11:10:33 <paul424>	Is there a way of creating automaticlly closing tags ? like <head> MAGIC_BINDING -> </head>
Feb 22 11:11:47 <graywolf>	Is there some alternative key binding to C-h?  For example, M-s C-h gives me the key bindings in that prefix.  How can I get the same for a prefix where C-h is actually mapped to some command?
Feb 22 11:16:08 <paul424>	C-c /		sgml-close-tag
Feb 22 11:16:21 <paul424>	when I execute this keybindnig I get : undefined
Feb 22 11:16:24 <paul424>	what 's up ?
Feb 22 11:20:17 <jbe>	hard to say
Feb 22 11:20:21 <arch-angel>	I recently installed consult but i noticed that consult-ripgrep, consult-locate, consult-find, consult-grep, consult-eglot-symbols, etc. all return "match required"?
Feb 22 11:21:14 <arch-angel>	my consult configuration is just a simple (use-package consult) thats it
Feb 22 11:21:45 <paul424>	jbe, what was emacs 'rescue mode' with minial config ?
Feb 22 11:21:49 <arch-angel>	but consult-imenu works for some reason
Feb 22 11:22:47 <paul424>	"nstall web-mode, http://web-mode.org/. It is the most complete mode for web pages and does contain what it calls HTML tag auto closing."
Feb 22 11:22:52 <paul424>	uhh that's also a suggestion
Feb 22 11:27:25 <arch-angel>	I've read the github page for consult and I don't see any special requirements i.e. additional packages that I need to install
Feb 22 11:44:25 <bpalmer>	paul424: are you looking for "emacs -Q " ?
Feb 22 11:44:42 <bpalmer>	paul424: that starts emacs without the site configuration or user configuration files loaded
Feb 22 11:44:52 <bpalmer>	(Xresources are still applied, however)
Feb 22 11:44:56 <paul424>	yeah, but now I have the web-mode... emacs now starts quite long
Feb 22 11:45:05 <paul424>	but ... let it be
Feb 22 11:47:40 <paul424>	bpalmer, thanks for the tip :) donno how  a regular user keeps memorizing all the emacs related stuff
Feb 22 11:48:56 <bpalmer>	paul424: you mean it's slow to start even when you're not doing web stuff?
Feb 22 11:49:24 <paul424>	I mean opening say index.html takes a minute
Feb 22 11:49:32 <paul424>	from scarch in emacs
Feb 22 11:49:39 <graywolf>	paul424: emacs --help is useful
Feb 22 11:50:24 <bpalmer>	paul424: ah. I'm not sure what would be causing the slowdown; what version of emacs are  you running?
Feb 22 11:50:43 <paul424>	the newest, openSuse Tumbleweed in here
Feb 22 11:51:19 <paul424>	but my .emacs quite stuffed
Feb 22 11:51:44 <bpalmer>	paul424: OK. I'm not familiar with opensuse's releases, but I'm assuming that's emacs 29/
Feb 22 11:51:45 <bpalmer>	?
Feb 22 11:51:48 <paul424>	Why it cannot be : for this file type use that config , for those file type use this config
Feb 22 11:51:49 <paul424>	yes
Feb 22 11:52:09 <paul424>	tumbleweed is a rolling release
Feb 22 11:52:36 <bpalmer>	paul424: emacs is designed to be configurable os that, e.g., html stuff is only loaded when you edit html
Feb 22 11:52:57 <bpalmer>	but if loading the html stuff is slow, then ...it's a pain.
Feb 22 11:53:04 <bpalmer>	Do you have native compilation enabled?
Feb 22 11:53:16 <paul424>	compilation of what ?
Feb 22 11:53:36 <golu8>	" paul424: C-c /		sgml-close-tag
Feb 22 11:53:37 <golu8>	[15:46]  paul424: when I execute this keybindnig I get : undefined" , try reloading package
Feb 22 11:53:37 <paul424>	aha I get what you mean
Feb 22 11:54:17 <paul424>	golu8, many thanks, but now I do use web-mode which is a tad-different
Feb 22 11:54:25 <bpalmer>	paul424: evaluate M-: (native-comp-available-p) RET   -- does it say nil or t ?
Feb 22 11:54:49 <paul424>	t
Feb 22 11:55:34 <bpalmer>	ok. In theory, this means that emacs will get faster after the first time it loads a library, as it compiles some of it into native code using a JIT compiler
Feb 22 11:56:02 <bpalmer>	so now that you have web mode installed, it might be faster the next time you use it.
Feb 22 12:20:24 <bpalmer>	Let's lose time as the day goes on.
Feb 22 12:22:53 <jbe>	time's a-wasting, you say?
Feb 22 12:23:05 <incal>	the uptime trajectory is still positive
Feb 22 12:26:03 <incal>	at least it doesn't decrease as quickly as it used to
Feb 22 12:26:52 <EdwardIII>	we're linking your salary to the number of 9s
Feb 22 12:40:43 <bremner>	bad news, there is only one 9
Feb 22 12:40:57 <codingquark>	one-9-9
Feb 22 12:41:09 <bremner>	nein, only one 9
Feb 22 12:41:30 <bremner>	rudybot: do jokes about German ever get old?
Feb 22 12:41:30 <rudybot>	bremner: I'm German. We don't do jokes.
Feb 22 12:41:35 <bremner>	good answer.
Feb 22 12:41:56 <codingquark>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emergency_telephone_numbers
Feb 22 12:43:34 <EdwardIII>	999 > 112
Feb 22 12:43:45 <EdwardIII>	why force people to remember *two* different types of number in an emergency??
Feb 22 12:43:45 <fsbot>	Improbable!
Feb 22 12:44:18 <jbe>	rudybot: what's the number for the ghostbusters?
Feb 22 12:44:18 <rudybot>	jbe: oh, he spent the time in between writing Freddy vs Jason and Freddy vs the Ghostbusters.
Feb 22 12:46:49 <EdwardIII>	judybot the phone number for the fire department is
Feb 22 12:46:49 <judybot>	error: 503: <html><body><h1>503 Service Unavailable</h1>
Feb 22 12:46:49 <judybot>	No server is available to handle this request.
Feb 22 12:46:49 <judybot>	</body></html>
Feb 22 12:46:53 <EdwardIII>	nice
Feb 22 12:47:03 <codingquark>	our team did not realise people are going to use the hammer as the nail
Feb 22 12:48:24 <jbe>	do they run firebase at the fire dptment?
Feb 22 12:49:23 <incal>	the phone number to the Ghostbusters is somewhere from 555-0100 to 555-0199 <https://www.dstny.se/en/blog/phone-numbers-in-movies/>
Feb 22 12:50:10 <jbe>	guess it's time to dig out the old war dialler
Feb 22 12:50:45 <EdwardIII>	which also inspired the song 555 by jimmy eat world
Feb 22 12:51:02 <incal>	I did a phile on phone numbers but it is in Swedish, https://dataswamp.org/~incal/phone/swedish-phone-numbers.txt
Feb 22 12:51:55 <jbe>	luckily I know swedish :)
Feb 22 12:52:09 <incal>	äran och hjältarnas språk
Feb 22 12:52:47 <incal>	I should add a note last on calling the Ghostbusters
Feb 22 12:54:21 <incal>	cool, didn't edit that file since 2021-03-21
Feb 22 12:54:25 <incal>	*happy*
Feb 22 12:54:43 <incal>	have you been smoking some weed in Sweeden
Feb 22 12:58:06 <codingquark>	,g yes or no?

Feb 22 12:59:00 <incal>	I was hoping for "yes and no

Feb 22 13:13:01 <incal>	,g I used to be hesitant but now I don't know

Feb 22 13:24:55 <APic>	Moin
Feb 22 13:24:56 <APic>	,BotSnack
Feb 22 13:24:57 <fsbot>	yay!
Feb 22 13:41:47 <_jac>	Morning! I'm trying to connect rcirc to more than one server. I try
Feb 22 13:42:02 <_jac>	(add-to-list 'rcirc-server-alist
Feb 22 13:42:02 <_jac>	             '("irc.libera.chat"
Feb 22 13:42:02 <_jac>	               :channels ("#emacs" "#systemcrafters")
Feb 22 13:42:02 <_jac>	               "irc.debian.org"
Feb 22 13:42:02 <_jac>	               :channels ("#debian")))
Feb 22 13:42:25 <_jac>	But it only connects to libera.chat
Feb 22 13:42:58 <_jac>	I tried to modify the syntax including commas, or extra brackets, but then I get errors.
Feb 22 13:43:38 <_jac>	it looks like only the first item in the list is used
Feb 22 13:44:45 <incal>	_jac, syntax error
Feb 22 13:45:38 <philipp_>	So when using eglot, I can use C-h . with Rust code to bring up documentation, which works nicely. But when I move the cursor now, the documentation window changes. Can I make it persistent?
Feb 22 13:45:55 <cpbotha>	_jac: it needs to be a list for each server. In the help: (SERVER-NAME PARAMETERS)
Feb 22 13:46:00 <philipp_>	Okay the quick fix is just to rename the Buffer
Feb 22 13:46:28 <grym>	philipp_: or M-x eldoc ret
Feb 22 13:46:36 <philipp_>	nvm renaming the buffer does not work
Feb 22 13:47:09 <philipp_>	grym: Also does not work; *eldoc* buffer still keeps changing
Feb 22 13:47:38 <grym>	odd. i .. dont think mine does.
Feb 22 13:48:13 <philipp_>	Why would anyone want that behaviour in the first place? I mean I open the documentation to implement something; of course I move the cursor.
Feb 22 13:49:34 <_jac>	cpbotha: something like (add-to-list 'rcirc_sever_alist '("irc.libera.chat" :channels (etc.)) 'rcirc-server-alist '("irc.debian" etc.))?

Feb 22 14:01:06 <_jac>	quitting to restart...
Feb 22 14:03:20 <incal>	_jac, C-h v rcirc-server-alist RET
Feb 22 14:04:07 <incal>	and instead of adding stuff to the list you can just use `setq' to set it to whatever, maybe that is easier
Feb 22 14:06:10 <_jac>	I see. The value stored in that variable has the same list repeated many times
Feb 22 14:07:03 <_jac>	I'll dig a bit deeper into that approach
Feb 22 14:07:06 <_jac>	much appreciated!
Feb 22 14:07:21 <incal>	np
Feb 22 14:33:02 <rpav>	"sanction" is an annoying verb
Feb 22 14:34:13 <grym>	especially if you've got to scale the north face with climbers  you don't trust
Feb 22 14:34:47 <rpav>	🤔
Feb 22 14:36:34 <grym>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eiger_Sanction_(film)
Feb 22 14:36:50 <grym>	it is, broadly, not a good film.  however, the climbing scenes are impeccably good
Feb 22 14:37:00 <rpav>	hah
Feb 22 14:37:06 <grym>	they're real, for a start
Feb 22 14:37:11 <rpav>	that helps
Feb 22 14:38:12 <grym>	and there are a few quotes that are golden
Feb 22 14:38:21 <grym>	'good weather, bad weather -- any time is good for climbing'
Feb 22 14:41:14 <JohnGalt>	no bad weather bad, Mt Ranier could be a death trap with bad weather
Feb 22 14:41:41 <JohnGalt>	I know because my dad almost died up there
Feb 22 14:41:53 <incal>	for high altitude mountaineering, weather is is decisive
Feb 22 14:42:13 <incal>	get stuck in a snow storm somewhere up on K2 - RIP
Feb 22 14:42:37 <incal>	but there are many types of climbing
Feb 22 14:43:22 <JohnGalt>	I climbed mt st helens, and mt olympus
Feb 22 14:43:33 <JohnGalt>	olympus was pretty dangerous
Feb 22 14:43:52 <JohnGalt>	mt st helens was easier and very cool to see a active volcano
Feb 22 14:44:14 <JohnGalt>	seeing a mountain starting its growth is amazing
Feb 22 14:44:34 <JohnGalt>	plus I was born not long after it blew
Feb 22 14:44:44 <incal>	I've been up some 15 meters in trees with climbing gear in a blizzard at night, while in theory it should be "as safe" as you should always be attached, in practice it gets more slippery and the darkness and cold reduces your confidence, your fingers get more fumbly and so on
Feb 22 14:45:48 <JohnGalt>	we did early morning to get fresh snow, but defintely not at night
Feb 22 14:46:29 <JohnGalt>	the milky way is amazing after a 20 mile hike to the base
Feb 22 14:50:54 <graywolf>	Is there a way to run infinite loop with a sleep and associate it with a buffer (so that is stops when buffer is closed)?  Use case:  I would like to run outline-hide-body every 1s in a indirect buffer.
Feb 22 14:52:25 <incal>	graywolf, you can check from the loop if that buffer is open
Feb 22 14:55:06 <graywolf>	incal: that seems to obvious... sigh, thank you :)
Feb 22 14:55:16 <incal>	np :)
Feb 22 15:09:35 <grym>	JohnGalt: the mountains don't give a shit about you, indeed
Feb 22 15:10:12 <JohnGalt>	yeah, the weather is really dangerous, so is inexperienced climbers
Feb 22 15:10:34 <JohnGalt>	the mountianiers is a good way to get experience
Feb 22 15:11:27 <JohnGalt>	I live in the only state that has three mountain ranges
Feb 22 15:11:40 <JohnGalt>	the olympic, the cascades, and the rockies
Feb 22 15:11:48 <grym>	mostly it's the latter
Feb 22 15:11:59 <incal>	but experienced people also has accidents, failures ... in climbing as well as other areas
Feb 22 15:12:11 <JohnGalt>	thats why you never climb alone
Feb 22 15:12:20 <grym>	soloing is a choice
Feb 22 15:12:38 <grym>	but it's a bit like sticking a knife in the toaster to get stuck bread out -- you gotta know why you shouldn't to be able to
Feb 22 15:12:42 <incal>	a lot of people also has its "downfalls"
Feb 22 15:13:09 <JohnGalt>	this solo thing must be some dumb fad
Feb 22 15:13:21 <JohnGalt>	until recently no climber would do that
Feb 22 15:13:52 <JohnGalt>	I cant imagine dying alone in the woods from a broken leg
Feb 22 15:14:10 <grym>	"recently" being like ... 60+ years, heh
Feb 22 15:14:19 <JohnGalt>	my brother almost died in iceland doing the solo thing
Feb 22 15:14:39 <incal>	indeed ... solo ascents have been forever
Feb 22 15:14:47 <JohnGalt>	he blew out his knee and had to hike many miles to the shelter
Feb 22 15:14:54 <incal>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Messner
Feb 22 15:15:03 <grym>	JohnGalt: that's also not climbing, heh
Feb 22 15:15:13 <JohnGalt>	it had climbing in parts
Feb 22 15:15:28 <grym>	incal: that man's a legend
Feb 22 15:15:38 <JohnGalt>	if you die alone you deserve your fate
Feb 22 15:15:43 <incal>	first solo ascent of Mount Everest
Feb 22 15:15:55 <JohnGalt>	good luck!
Feb 22 15:15:57 <grym>	incal: and like, friggin' everything else
Feb 22 15:16:38 <grym>	JohnGalt: first solo of everest was put up in 1980, no supplemental O2 eithie
Feb 22 15:16:50 <JohnGalt>	good luck!
Feb 22 15:17:05 <grym>	i mean.  he's still alive
Feb 22 15:17:06 <grym>	so... yes
Feb 22 15:17:21 <incal>	in general doing stuff alone makes it more difficult but there are many expedition involving lots of stuff that has been huge tragedies
Feb 22 15:17:40 <incal>	lots of *people
Feb 22 15:17:47 <JohnGalt>	we all have choices and consequences of those choices
Feb 22 15:17:56 <JohnGalt>	Ill choose mine, you choose yours
Feb 22 15:18:04 <grym>	incal: siege vs alpine climbing
Feb 22 15:18:44 <grym>	in fairness, i've never done anything above 12.5k'
Feb 22 15:19:09 <incal>	I have only done rock climbing
Feb 22 15:19:40 <grym>	sport lead 5.10a, follow 5.10b, trad follow 5.9
Feb 22 15:20:01 <grym>	so no great shakes
Feb 22 15:20:26 <grym>	i was projecting 5.11a or so the last time i was climbing multiple times per week
Feb 22 15:20:52 <grym>	but i'm better on slab than overhang, and the indoor place i was grinding at sets more overhang than not
Feb 22 15:20:52 <incal>	it is a very pleasant game
Feb 22 15:20:52 <JohnGalt>	I dont think I have anything to gain by further climbing
Feb 22 15:21:08 <incal>	interesting
Feb 22 15:21:31 <JohnGalt>	I saw amazing things, there is not alot to go from there
Feb 22 15:21:50 <JohnGalt>	crevasse jumping is awesome
Feb 22 15:22:22 <incal>	the sky is the limit
Feb 22 15:23:13 <JohnGalt>	generally with anything once I have peaked I stop doing it
Feb 22 15:23:39 <grym>	sounds boring
Feb 22 15:23:57 <JohnGalt>	not really, just move on to the next experience
Feb 22 15:23:58 <grym>	"i did it once" is far less interesting than "i can reliably do"
Feb 22 15:24:36 <JohnGalt>	Ive been hiking and climbing since I was a child, there is not alot more to do
Feb 22 15:24:54 <JohnGalt>	I think I started at 7 or 8
Feb 22 15:25:13 <JohnGalt>	I hiked ozette before the oil spill
Feb 22 15:25:23 <catern>	aaaaa
Feb 22 15:25:33 <catern>	I wish there was a nicer way to switch windows in core Emacs
Feb 22 15:25:53 <catern>	I just realized that the windmove bindings replacing shift-arrow-keys are kinda annoying
Feb 22 15:26:02 <catern>	maybe I should just enable repeat-mode
Feb 22 15:26:06 <JohnGalt>	I wrote buffer-ring which is a torus of buffers
Feb 22 15:26:16 <JohnGalt>	it was forked and its in melpa
Feb 22 15:26:18 <catern>	yeah yeah probably I should just enable repeat-mode
Feb 22 15:28:41 <incal>	I didn't hike a lot but I do go for a couple of nights every summer to live in a tent in some forest nearby, here is what I bring: https://dataswamp.org/~incal/emacs-init/tent.el
Feb 22 15:28:52 <incal>	it computes to 17 items, 8450 g - haha
Feb 22 15:29:29 <JohnGalt>	what unit is that? what is that in pounds?
Feb 22 15:30:18 <incal>	'units -t '8450 g' pounds' says 18.629061
Feb 22 15:30:20 <grym>	g is fairly unambiguously "grams"
Feb 22 15:30:32 <grym>	that's pretty light!
Feb 22 15:30:43 <JohnGalt>	I only use grams for weighing my bird
Feb 22 15:30:54 <grym>	coffee :)
Feb 22 15:31:07 <JohnGalt>	I was doing about 100 pounds for long hikes or climbs
Feb 22 15:31:45 <JohnGalt>	or weighing weed
Feb 22 15:32:09 <redacted>	incal: also possible to do that in Emacs Calc with `u c`
Feb 22 15:32:22 <incal>	this is excluding food and fuel, "consumables"
Feb 22 15:32:36 <incal>	redacted, is that a spreadsheet?
Feb 22 15:32:49 <incal>	seems like an ideal application for that use case
Feb 22 15:32:59 <incal>	ah, no, you mean units
Feb 22 15:33:00 <grym>	incal: ah.  ok, so you'll be at about the same pack weight as me when it all shakes out then
Feb 22 15:33:09 <grym>	ye olde tubbe of skippy does weigh a bit
Feb 22 15:33:34 <redacted>	incal haha sounds like it. nah, it the Emacs calculator. C-h R calc for the manual
Feb 22 15:33:36 <rpav>	cooking is way easier if you do everything in grams
Feb 22 15:33:55 <grym>	rpav: baking by mass is certainly good
Feb 22 15:34:06 <JohnGalt>	I can see that for coffee, but my only gram scale is the digi
Feb 22 15:34:07 <grym>	not-baking food prep can be a lot more freeform
Feb 22 15:34:09 <rpav>	like vs cups/spoons/other bs, and grams are a relatively useful unit range
Feb 22 15:34:24 <rpav>	grym: nah i do everything in grams.. flour, milk, water, etc
Feb 22 15:34:38 <grym>	baker's percentage is fantastic
Feb 22 15:34:39 <rpav>	spice mixtures too
Feb 22 15:34:40 <grym>	and unit independent
Feb 22 15:35:00 <JohnGalt>	I dondt even know what a gram feels like, Ive heard its about the same as a paper clip
Feb 22 15:35:03 <grym>	in fact, it can be unitless entirely :)
Feb 22 15:35:04 <rpav>	i have a scale that measures down to 100th of a gram (which i assume is like "centigram" but i've never seen it used)
Feb 22 15:35:25 <JohnGalt>	I cant imagine using liters, except for soda bottles
Feb 22 15:35:32 <grym>	rudybot: liter cola
Feb 22 15:35:32 <rudybot>	grym: eh, i pay like 3bucks a liter and never went blind yet
Feb 22 15:36:00 <grym>	rpav: have you encountered baker's percentage yet
Feb 22 15:36:08 <incal>	to make a list of equipment is not only to compute the weight but also to get an overview of what to bring. you have all the stuff neat in your home or garage then just check against the list you have everything. so it is useful but also fun to tinker with using the favorite editor
Feb 22 15:36:13 <rpav>	grym: don't think so, what is it like "about this much"? ;)
Feb 22 15:36:36 <rpav>	ah jsut ratio
Feb 22 15:36:47 <grym>	rpav: your (arbitrary) mass of flour is 100%.  Then i can tell you what percent of that is water, salt, yeast, ...
Feb 22 15:37:02 <rpav>	kinda makes sense but you still have to measure somehow
Feb 22 15:37:08 <grym>	it scales arbitrarily, and you can, if you have to, do it off a balance
Feb 22 15:37:16 <grym>	you don't need to  ever know an absolute measure
Feb 22 15:37:22 <redacted>	incal, separately, Emacs does have a spreadsheet (C-h R ses), because of course it does
Feb 22 15:38:22 <incal>	yeah, while I'm happy with that Elisp and it didn't take me too long to write if I was good with the spreadsheet that would have been even faster and maybe better as well
Feb 22 15:38:27 <rpav>	grym: i can definitely see that being a useful way to preserve/communicate recipes
Feb 22 15:39:15 <grym>	rpav: it's very useful, yeah,  much more useful than my MIL's recipe, which does the classic thing of giving a measure in cups, but the cup the recipe means is "this exact teacup i personally have used for years for baking, i have no idea how much flour it actually holds"
Feb 22 15:39:24 <incal>	redacted, God willing I'll find another use case in life and I'll use that as an excuse to use Emacs even more :)
Feb 22 15:39:41 <grym>	volumetric measurements, bleah :)
Feb 22 15:39:45 <rpav>	grym: D:
Feb 22 15:39:54 <rpav>	yehah
Feb 22 15:40:27 <JohnGalt>	volumetric is good for mixology
Feb 22 15:40:34 <rpav>	i usually just write down a reasonably rough conversion in grams and scale off that
Feb 22 15:40:36 <JohnGalt>	oz/jigger
Feb 22 15:40:45 <grym>	JohnGalt: because all the densities are roughly comparable
Feb 22 15:40:58 <JohnGalt>	exactly, very easy
Feb 22 15:41:10 <rpav>	also you don't need to be very precise and need to get it done fast
Feb 22 15:41:36 <JohnGalt>	I use two oz, and two ice in a shaker, because Im lazy and I just want scotch, or bourbon
Feb 22 15:41:55 <grym>	liquids also don't settle or pack
Feb 22 15:41:59 <grym>	unlike, say, flour
Feb 22 15:42:17 <rpav>	ice with scotch or bourbon?! ;)
Feb 22 15:42:25 <grym>	,heretic
Feb 22 15:42:26 <fsbot>	Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius.
Feb 22 15:42:32 <JohnGalt>	water is key to mixology
Feb 22 15:42:49 <JohnGalt>	you cant taste the whiskey if you anthesitize your tastebuds
Feb 22 15:42:59 <JohnGalt>	read up on mixology
Feb 22 15:43:13 <rpav>	that's why i'm confused as to why you'd use ice
Feb 22 15:43:16 <grym>	^
Feb 22 15:43:17 <JohnGalt>	also never on the rocks, it dilutes over time
Feb 22 15:43:47 <JohnGalt>	shake it and it adds water, strain the remainder of the cubes, perfect whiskey
Feb 22 15:43:58 <JohnGalt>	then put it in a ice bucket
Feb 22 15:44:21 <rpav>	i can never taste it as well if it's chilled, i prefer room temperature neat
Feb 22 15:44:34 <JohnGalt>	then put your nose in it and breathe in the flavors
Feb 22 15:44:41 <JohnGalt>	then sip it
Feb 22 15:45:20 <incal>	you need a PhD to drink alcohol these days
Feb 22 15:45:22 <JohnGalt>	drinking it neat is just for getting trashed
Feb 22 15:45:51 <rpav>	also chilled means less evaporation
Feb 22 15:46:24 <incal>	,g Why do people form rings around underage people at parties and shout "drink, drink, drink"?
Feb 22 15:46:25 <JohnGalt>	I try and drink the highest carbon footprint alchohol possible
Feb 22 15:46:25 <fsbot>	🤖[g] To give them the "circle of trust" experience early on!
Feb 22 15:46:27 <rpav>	(though tbh i'm not sure how much or if you could tell)
Feb 22 15:46:32 <JohnGalt>	I want to taste the planet dying
Feb 22 15:47:19 <rpav>	isn't that why one drinks peaty scotch?
Feb 22 15:47:40 <JohnGalt>	I drink some scotch , but also Jefferson Ocean
Feb 22 15:47:41 <rpav>	also wow snarky bot or something, bravo ;)
Feb 22 15:48:03 <JohnGalt>	the ocean is sailed around the world for a year taking it through different climates
Feb 22 15:48:09 <JohnGalt>	and it rocks the whiskey
Feb 22 15:48:22 <JohnGalt>	incredible flavor
Feb 22 15:48:53 <JohnGalt>	I heard that the barrels sweat whiskey when they go through the panama canal
Feb 22 15:49:16 <hodapp>	I prefer bourbon
Feb 22 15:49:30 <JohnGalt>	it is bourbon, bourbon just means a corn mash
Feb 22 15:49:37 <JohnGalt>	scotch is a kind of whiskey too
Feb 22 15:49:42 <JohnGalt>	rye is grain based
Feb 22 15:49:56 <JohnGalt>	kentucky is filtered through peat
Feb 22 15:50:01 <hodapp>	'it' is bourbon? what is?
Feb 22 15:50:15 <JohnGalt>	bourbon is mostly corn mash
Feb 22 15:50:21 <JohnGalt>	its sweeter
Feb 22 15:50:35 <hodapp>	what is the 'it' you were talking about there?
Feb 22 15:50:48 <JohnGalt>	bourbon
Feb 22 15:51:32 <JohnGalt>	jeffersons is a bourbon blend
Feb 22 15:51:46 <EdwardIII>	i'm sure i remember something about lisp interaction mode auto escaping quotes when pasting a string inside a lisp string
Feb 22 15:51:58 <EdwardIII>	but i tried it, i also tried slurping the " over the existing string but nada. did i imagine it?
Feb 22 15:52:29 <rpav>	EdwardIII: not sure when pasting, but when typing i think
Feb 22 15:52:58 <EdwardIII>	sure there's that, i'm sure there was some other magic though when squirting in an existing string with quotes
Feb 22 16:06:35 <ohnoitsnoah>	Howdy y'alll
Feb 22 16:07:57 <JohnGalt>	ahoy matey!
Feb 22 16:11:08 <ohnoitsnoah>	Hello!!!
Feb 22 16:11:19 <ohnoitsnoah>	How is your morning so far?
Feb 22 16:12:07 <JohnGalt>	not bad, fixed some bugs
Feb 22 16:12:31 <JohnGalt>	unfortunately I woke up at 3:30am
Feb 22 16:12:57 <ohnoitsnoah>	Awww that's a bummer, but congrats with the bugs
Feb 22 16:13:05 <ohnoitsnoah>	I went to sleep around 3am lol
Feb 22 16:13:25 <JohnGalt>	I used to go for 3-5 days at a time\
Feb 22 16:13:33 <JohnGalt>	but luckily I fixed that
Feb 22 16:14:06 <ohnoitsnoah>	Yeahh, I can stay up late but no way I could do days haha
Feb 22 16:14:18 <JohnGalt>	I didnt really have a choice
Feb 22 16:14:29 <ohnoitsnoah>	This morning I decided to learn Tex randomly, so I'm watching videos on it right now
Feb 22 16:14:42 <JohnGalt>	latex is pretty cool
Feb 22 16:14:51 <ohnoitsnoah>	Yeah I'd imagine that wouldn't normally be a choice
Feb 22 16:15:48 <ohnoitsnoah>	I'm kinda cheating though, I'm using GNU Texmacs so I don't have to reallly write plain Tex code
Feb 22 16:15:59 <JohnGalt>	I tried ambien for a while but that is the worst medicine I have ever taken
Feb 22 16:16:04 <JohnGalt>	took a month to stop it
Feb 22 16:16:24 <arch-angel>	does anyone here happen to use consult? All the commands from consult-* gives me 0 matches
Feb 22 16:16:34 <arch-angel>	I have no idea if I'm using it wrong, or if I'm missing some dependency
Feb 22 16:16:38 <ohnoitsnoah>	I don't even know what that does
Feb 22 16:16:41 <ohnoitsnoah>	What is it for?
Feb 22 16:17:39 <arch-angel>	ohnoitsnoah, are you asking me?
Feb 22 16:18:33 <grym>	ttps://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ambien-walrus
Feb 22 16:19:22 <ohnoitsnoah>	arch-angel: yes :)
Feb 22 16:19:35 <arch-angel>	right, https://github.com/minad/consult
Feb 22 16:20:01 <arch-angel>	I mean, I also just installed consult so my understanding of it is very very limited
Feb 22 16:20:30 <arch-angel>	but as far as I know it provides nice looking interfaces for all sorts of stuff like grep, rg, locate, find, etc.
Feb 22 16:22:47 <e1f>	if all goes to plan, today at 5:45PM EST, a probe from a private u.s. company will land on the moon's south pole. near the surface, it will release a camera drone to record itself landing. nasa tv will livestream
Feb 22 16:24:16 <EdwardIII>	arch-angel did you add their recommended setup to your init.el?
Feb 22 16:24:39 <ohnoitsnoah>	elf woahhhh that sounds neat!
Feb 22 16:24:41 <EdwardIII>	https://github.com/minad/consult?tab=readme-ov-file#use-package-example
Feb 22 16:31:34 <arch-angel>	EdwardIII, I omitted the keybinds part but the :init and :config, yeah I copy pasted it into my init.el
Feb 22 16:36:35 <EdwardIII>	arch-angel i may not be much help but could you give a more specific example so i can compare?
Feb 22 16:36:48 <arch-angel>	https://termbin.com/on8n
Feb 22 16:36:50 <arch-angel>	this is my config
Feb 22 16:37:17 <EdwardIII>	i mean a more specific example of 0 matches
Feb 22 16:37:24 <arch-angel>	right
Feb 22 16:37:59 <arch-angel>	so let's just say there's a string of "abcd" in a file, I invoke consult-grep it shows me a line with a # typed in, and I just type in abcd
Feb 22 16:38:19 <arch-angel>	I wait, there's no response, I press enter, it tells me match required
Feb 22 16:38:45 <EdwardIII>	hmm yeah that does seem to just work for me
Feb 22 16:38:54 <EdwardIII>	you don't have any other completion framework installed also?
Feb 22 16:39:02 <arch-angel>	wdym completion framework?
Feb 22 16:39:10 <EdwardIII>	like counsel
Feb 22 16:39:18 <arch-angel>	yes I do have counsel
Feb 22 16:39:45 <EdwardIII>	from memory i vaguely recall having to get rid of counsel before counsult worked
Feb 22 16:39:57 <arch-angel>	oh
Feb 22 16:40:05 <arch-angel>	damn they conflict each other?
Feb 22 16:40:08 <EdwardIII>	maybe TIAS?
Feb 22 16:40:15 <EdwardIII>	could be total nonsense
Feb 22 16:40:26 <corwin>	fsbot: this is my config is <reply>There are many like it, but this one is mine.
Feb 22 16:40:28 <fsbot>	:(   [set tErM] this is aLreaDy someThing elSe.. usE ’is also’..
Feb 22 16:40:28 <fsbot>	 CurrenTly: tO thAt as thE oTher is tO itSelf, Selah.
Feb 22 16:40:40 <arch-angel>	I do like the counsel-fzf function though
Feb 22 16:40:47 <arch-angel>	sadly consult does not have that I believe
Feb 22 16:41:15 <arch-angel>	I'll try disabling counsel
Feb 22 16:41:47 <EdwardIII>	just to rule it out
Feb 22 16:41:55 <NotThatRPG>	Is it possible to use file local variables to control auto-fill-mode and visual-line-mode ?
Feb 22 16:42:18 <NotThatRPG>	I have specific files (not file extensions) for which I would like to differentially enable/disable these
Feb 22 16:43:00 <arch-angel>	EdwardIII, consult-ripgrep works when counsel-mode is disabled
Feb 22 16:43:07 <arch-angel>	that's interesting
Feb 22 16:43:17 <ldb>	NotThatRPG: set variable auto-fill-function
Feb 22 16:43:56 <EdwardIII>	arch-angel well at least you have a starting point. others who know more about this may know why / what to do
Feb 22 16:44:07 <arch-angel>	thanks for the help
Feb 22 16:44:20 <arch-angel>	seems like it's a long day of debugging ahead for me
Feb 22 16:44:20 <ldb>	visual-line-mode is not possible to do by just set a variable
Feb 22 16:44:44 <EdwardIII>	a long day eh
Feb 22 16:45:18 <arch-angel>	yeh
Feb 22 16:45:20 <ldb>	but one can append any lisp code to the file local var to be run
Feb 22 16:46:11 <arch-angel>	hmm, now that it works, the behaviour of consult-ripgrep is very different than the behaviour shown in the screenshots
Feb 22 16:46:58 <arch-angel>	EdwardIII, is the default behaviour supposed to be just showing a gigantic buffer which you have to manually scroll through? the gifs in the github show a much more refined interface
Feb 22 16:47:49 <EdwardIII>	arch-angel i don't use the grep feature, but i imagine the idea is you type a bit more to narrow the choices
Feb 22 16:48:00 <arch-angel>	no I mean in general for consult
Feb 22 16:48:04 <arch-angel>	I don't have vertico installed
Feb 22 16:48:18 <NotThatRPG>	I'd love to use .dir-locals for this, but... can it match specific files?
Feb 22 16:48:19 <arch-angel>	I'm getting the default ugly emacs selection buffer
Feb 22 16:48:36 <arch-angel>	not exactly ugly but well, pretty crude I guess
Feb 22 16:48:41 <NotThatRPG>	I have colleagues that insist on making some text files be one-line-per-paragraph instead of using auto-fill
Feb 22 16:53:04 <ldb>	NotThatRPG: too many ways to do that, either define a derived mode with the minor modes and hook it to the file, or write a expression tests the file name and apply minor modes
Feb 22 16:53:28 <ldb>	or add a function that enables minor modes depends on file name to the mode hook
Feb 22 16:53:34 <corwin>	Maybe check out `visual-fill-column-mode' ?
Feb 22 16:54:03 <NotThatRPG>	ldb: Right, so I could add a latex-mode-hook for this....
Feb 22 16:54:29 <ldb>	or if the file is git version controled, write git post processing
Feb 22 16:55:08 <arch-angel>	ohhhh it's vertico thats the trick
Feb 22 16:55:15 <arch-angel>	damn consult+vertico looks good
Feb 22 16:55:35 <ldb>	not if you are still using emacs 28
Feb 22 17:06:18 <NotThatRPG>	ldb: Are file-local-variables set before or after hooks are run?
Feb 22 17:07:44 <NotThatRPG>	I was thinking of setting a file-local variable (in the local variables block) to indicate whether or not a file should be auto-filled. But I'm not sure those variables are set before the hook is run (looks like not)
Feb 22 17:22:41 <ndegruchy>	vertico is neat, but with marginalia I found that it fails to wrap text well when the entries become too long on one side
Feb 22 17:23:42 <ldb>	NotThatRPG: if they weren't, call (hack-local-variables) manually
Feb 22 17:23:53 <NotThatRPG>	ldb: Thanks!!!!
Feb 22 17:24:40 <NotThatRPG>	ldb: I had no idea that function existed.  Really appreciate all of yourhelp
Feb 22 17:27:15 <ldb>	NotThatRPG: you're welcome
Feb 22 17:34:28 <ndegruchy>	TIL about keep-lines and flush-lines
Feb 22 17:35:14 <grym>	ndegruchy: oh you read yacker yews this morning too huh
Feb 22 17:36:14 <grym>	i learned about fill-prefix
Feb 22 17:36:50 <ndegruchy>	grym: yeah, good article
Feb 22 17:43:11 <grym>	ndegruchy: it's all susam's fault!!
Feb 22 17:46:18 <grym>	https://0x0.st/H5Q7.png
Feb 22 17:46:20 <grym>	heh heh heh
Feb 22 17:46:24 <grym>	ai is going great

Feb 22 18:35:30 <grym>	all my favorite things are fractally deep anyway, not just my editors
Feb 22 18:36:11 <grym>	cf http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail
Feb 22 18:36:41 <cvandusen>	It's embark that might be the most difficult. Currently, when switching buffers I might see some buffer that I think "Oh, I can kill that one" and can do so without leaving the ivy-context. I haven't found the way to do that with embark.
Feb 22 18:36:55 <grym>	i have not yet decided to care about embark
Feb 22 18:37:30 <cvandusen>	It seems to try to be a bit more smarter than it needs to be. idk
Feb 22 18:39:06 <grym>	it's certainly not clicked for me yet
Feb 22 18:39:31 <janneke>	wgreenhouse: thanks
Feb 22 18:40:07 <bpalmer>	"Would you rather be smart or pretty?" "Oh, easy, pretty. You can fake being smart."
Feb 22 18:40:49 <janneke>	yeah, i've also got no incentive or intention to move, but i fear X/exwm support just might not be as amazing as it is today some time (soon?)
Feb 22 18:42:50 <cvandusen>	Nowadays with enough cosmetic surgery, one can fake being pretty.
Feb 22 18:43:32 <bpalmer>	one wonders at the word "fake" in that case
Feb 22 18:43:47 <cvandusen>	shallow fake??
Feb 22 18:43:48 <fsbot>	Don't count on it!
Feb 22 18:44:06 *	cvandusen cancels the botox
Feb 22 18:47:51 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: I have a calculator and I count on it!
Feb 22 18:47:52 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: the calculator on my phone is about 1.4M
Feb 22 18:48:44 <edgar-rft>	probably all results precomputed at compile time
Feb 22 18:49:30 <edrx>	hi all! gmorning!
Feb 22 18:50:25 <edgar-rft>	good mourning
Feb 22 18:51:50 <edrx>	anyone here uses npm? I have some basic questions... I know very little javascript, and I would like to make something like the second screenshot here - http://anggtwu.net/find-yttranscript-links.html - i.e., a function called find-npm-link that displays a temporary buffer with elisp hyperlinks and shell commands for npm...
Feb 22 18:52:34 <edrx>	but man npm-ls mentions "npm help folders", that AFAICT does not exist
Feb 22 18:53:45 <edrx>	what is the npm subcommand for displaying all local files associated to a certain npm package?
Feb 22 18:53:59 <edrx>	edgar-rft: oops, gmourning =)
Feb 22 18:54:39 <Odin-LAP>	edrx: Is there one?
Feb 22 18:55:27 <edrx>	Odin-LAP: no idea
Feb 22 18:57:28 <subopt>	I want to redo the byte compiles of all my installed melpa packages on emacs 28.2 . They were originally installed by emacs 29.1. Is there a way to 'reinstall' or redo them all without uninstalling them first?
Feb 22 18:57:48 <edrx>	tbh/btw all my friends and acquaintaces who do javascript programming here in Brazil only answer questions in two ways... either with "it's easy!" or with "use the package bla"
Feb 22 18:58:16 <technomancy>	lol
Feb 22 18:58:27 <edrx>	that's why I thought that it would be better to ask here
Feb 22 18:58:40 <ndegruchy>	subopt, a high-level solution would be to find all elc/eln files and then find all el files and run them through the emacs byte-compiler
Feb 22 18:59:00 <ndegruchy>	find all the elc/n files and delete them
Feb 22 18:59:08 <technomancy>	rudybot: first step is scoop out the part of your brain that prevents you from making bad decisions, then the rest of npm is a breeze
Feb 22 18:59:10 <rudybot>	technomancy: A scoop of pistashcio in a sugar-cone.
Feb 22 19:00:07 <ndegruchy>	edrx: I know nothing about npm or node, but you should be able to get a path out of NPM for a given package
Feb 22 19:01:15 <edrx>	subopt: I'm 99% sure that this is much more basic than what you need, but I've just learned - half an hour ago - that I can do this: (byte-recompile-directory "~/.emacs.d/elpa/lean4-mode/")
Feb 22 19:01:58 <subopt>	edrx: thanks, i'll try it that way first
Feb 22 19:14:25 <johnjaye>	someone asked a question about motors and I just pasted the output of chatgpt to their question.
Feb 22 19:14:39 <johnjaye>	we need a modern version of "let me ai that for you"
Feb 22 19:14:51 <technomancy>	was it someone you don't like?
Feb 22 19:15:09 <hodapp>	did the person complain that the ChatGPT answer didn't include any white people?
Feb 22 19:15:27 <johnjaye>	technomancy: it was a newcomer to the channel, so... probably.
Feb 22 19:15:33 <technomancy>	I hate it when people do that
Feb 22 19:15:55 <technomancy>	it's like ... I'm asking because I want to know what humans think. if I didn't want to know that, I wouldn't have asked.
Feb 22 19:16:03 <johnjaye>	we have it nice here at #emacs though because we have a channel bot for those types of things.
Feb 22 19:16:16 <technomancy>	we have it nice because it's easy to put those bot replies on ignore
Feb 22 19:16:36 <technomancy>	of course it would be much better if it was a bot dedicated to that so you could use regular /ignore instead of having to write some elisp to ignore the garbage
Feb 22 19:17:01 <technomancy>	but I guess it's not that bad since most people in this channel don't mind writing elisp
Feb 22 19:17:03 <johnjaye>	his exact opening was "I'm looking for a basic primer on motors, specifically.."
Feb 22 19:17:19 <johnjaye>	so rather than give him a youtube video I took the easy path.
Feb 22 19:17:40 <technomancy>	well, now I know never to ask you a question
Feb 22 19:17:46 <thuna`>	You should have asked the bot for a youtube video instead
Feb 22 19:17:51 <johnjaye>	it can't do that
Feb 22 19:18:02 <johnjaye>	it says it doesn't have access to internet sites. at least gpt3.5 doesn't.
Feb 22 19:18:08 <ndegruchy>	pandoc is great
Feb 22 19:18:15 <technomancy>	surely it could hallucinate a URL if you asked nicely enough
Feb 22 19:18:27 <johnjaye>	if it's a yes or no question i'll answer it generally, maybe with some extra context.
Feb 22 19:18:42 <johnjaye>	but if it's something you should be typing into google, that does irritate me a bit.
Feb 22 19:18:56 <ieure>	Nobody should type anything into Google, ever, for any reason.
Feb 22 19:19:03 <technomancy>	it irritated me more back when google actually worked well
Feb 22 19:19:13 <ieure>	Yes, this.
Feb 22 19:19:50 <johnjaye>	that ai answer might be better than google eventually.
Feb 22 19:20:13 <thuna`>	And then it'll cannibalize itself
Feb 22 19:20:14 <grym>	we have it nice because i, at least, will very seriously consider kicking people who copypaste llm output in response to humans asking questions and expecting to get a human response
Feb 22 19:20:20 <grym>	the bots are supposed to be inane; users aren't
Feb 22 19:20:49 <johnjaye>	i think it would qualify as flooding on irc. chatgpt is very verbose if you don't tell it to limit itself.
Feb 22 19:21:47 <grym>	oh i'll kick you for bad taste
Feb 22 19:21:57 *	thuna` .oO(Which is why fsbot shouldn't have that functionality to begin with)
Feb 22 19:21:57 <grym>	.. you can come back, ofc
Feb 22 19:22:30 <johnjaye>	i didn't realize fsbot was being user-friendly by limiting so much of the responses.
Feb 22 19:23:49 <corwin>	deego has put some effort to make it reply tersely where possible, I think.
Feb 22 19:26:40 <gusgr>	folks, i would like your help on something minibuffer related. so far i was using ivy and for switching buffers specifically, ivy-switch-buffer which is acting similarly to built in switch-to-buffer but with ivy completion. this specific command would allow matching against the *mode* of the buffer, and specifically i got used to switch like that, by matching the mode first and then previewing, if needed, the different options
Feb 22 19:28:43 <gusgr>	but yesterday i thought of switching to Vertico/Marginalia/Consult and while i had set them up, the switch-to-buffer command now won't match on the mode specifically, cause it comes from Marginalia. i mean i understand why it doesn't work like i was used to, but i want to figure out if i can make it work like i was used to
Feb 22 19:30:12 <gusgr>	and found out about Embark, which i setup also, but this method creates a whole new buffere where i have to search. so it's not really the same. it would be way faster to run ibuffer actually and search there instead of consult-buffer->embark-export->search
Feb 22 19:31:09 <gusgr>	or i hadn't understood something here, am i supposed to create some content with embark to feed the minibuffer completion somehow so i combine everything into a single command? is that possible?
Feb 22 19:33:49 <ndegruchy>	embark is ... difficult to use
Feb 22 19:34:01 <ndegruchy>	unless you know what you're getting into
Feb 22 19:34:44 <ndegruchy>	,ping
Feb 22 19:34:45 <fsbot>	␕
Feb 22 19:53:22 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: in the distance you hear a dog embark
Feb 22 19:53:22 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: obviously that would only be for backwards compatibility purposes.  (not that i personally plan to embark on this endeavor, just pondering)
Feb 22 20:01:09 <danza>	<3 eww
Feb 22 20:08:35 <bpalmer>	A typographic dog knows when to em-bark and when to en-bark.
Feb 22 20:16:20 <bpalmer>	rudybot: what is in a typographic st. bernard's cask?
Feb 22 20:16:21 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Bernard Wolfe's best-known work is science fiction
Feb 22 20:16:43 <danza>	try again rudybot
Feb 22 20:18:02 <bpalmer>	Hmm. An interesting note on him from https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/wolfe_bernard : 'In his "Afterword" to these stories, Wolfe expressed an extreme hostility to science and also to sf, which he considered its handmaiden. Further details of his career can be found in Memoirs of a Not Altogether Shy Pornographer '
Feb 22 20:19:19 <bpalmer>	I've never heard of his novel _Limbo_ from 1952, but it seems intriguing.
Feb 22 20:21:00 <rpav>	the characters really have to bend over backwards in that one
Feb 22 20:21:17 *	Odin-LAP has generally found that there is an interesting correlation between expressing a strong belief that science is totalitarian and being an active apologist for totalitarianism.
Feb 22 20:21:22 <Odin-LAP>	Don't know if that applies here.
Feb 22 20:22:24 <rpav>	don't people try to use science (among others) to legitimize $thing in general
Feb 22 20:24:51 <bpalmer>	Odin-LAP: He did work for a while as bodyguard and secretary to Trotsky in Mexico.
Feb 22 20:25:27 <bpalmer>	insert some educated discussion here about whether trotsky was totalitarian.
Feb 22 20:26:17 <danza>	well trotskism was attacked in all totalitarian states (right and left) as far as i recall

Feb 22 20:37:58 <Odin-LAP>	Nope.
Feb 22 20:38:00 <Odin-LAP>	Ice axe.
Feb 22 20:38:27 <e1f>	we're just nitpicking now
Feb 22 20:38:55 <bpalmer>	If pickaxe, you'd assume it was done by a minecraft fan.

Feb 22 21:18:07 <e1f>	lunar landing has been moved back by 1 hour to 6:24PM EST; controllers added one more orbit
Feb 22 21:19:40 <thuna`>	Oof, org-sticky-header is also just looping up and collecting individual headings
Feb 22 21:25:30 <thuna`>	Alright, you can use org-element-at-point and repeatedly get the :parent property via org-element-property.  I want all headings in the file, though, so it's more efficient to use org-element-parse-buffer instead.
Feb 22 21:31:04 <mekeor>	thuna`: why the whole buffer? i thought you want only parents of the current heading
Feb 22 21:32:45 <incal>	,g Is it the men who create the women's beauty?

Feb 22 21:33:26 <thuna`>	mekeor: That was an xy situation.  What I needed is a list of all headings, formatted like "parent1/parent2/parent3/heading"
Feb 22 21:33:51 <mekeor>	thuna`: that's what consult-org-heading offers
Feb 22 21:34:09 <thuna`>	mekeor: But I don't want unnecessary dependencies
Feb 22 21:34:17 <thuna`>	(And I don't use consult in general)
Feb 22 21:34:46 <mekeor>	ok, its code might still be of interest in that case
Feb 22 21:35:12 <mekeor>	thuna`: i'm curious, which mini-buffer-completion-framework do you use?
Feb 22 21:35:19 <thuna`>	mekeor: selectrum
Feb 22 21:37:05 <thuna`>	It works decently with everything and I don't need to learn a separate language just to read code written for it (ahem ahem helm)
Feb 22 21:41:54 <mekeor>	"Selectrum has been replaced by Vertico" https://github.com/radian-software/selectrum
Feb 22 21:43:26 <rpav>	at this rate, within 10 years, minibuffer completion frameworks will dominate everything else on the internet!
Feb 22 21:43:36 <Odin-LAP>	The only thing I really need added to the default completion is live updating.
Feb 22 21:43:47 <thuna`>	"There are too many conflicting completion frameworks!"
Feb 22 21:43:57 <rpav>	Odin-LAP: i really like to be able to type "a b c" to complete "a.*b.*c"
Feb 22 21:44:06 <rpav>	but i get that with ivy or whatever so i'm fine with it
Feb 22 21:44:20 <rpav>	what i _want_ is a completion framework that's buffer-backed, not list-backed
Feb 22 21:44:41 <thuna`>	That's controlled by completion-styles
Feb 22 21:44:49 <Odin-LAP>	rpav: I believe it's now possible to get that using the built-in completion thing.
Feb 22 21:45:15 <Odin-LAP>	But I don't think there's a style to do it included by default.
Feb 22 21:45:32 <rpav>	Odin-LAP: i mean for data sourcing rather than display
Feb 22 21:45:39 <mekeor>	orderless is an external package that provides nice completion styles
Feb 22 21:45:42 <rpav>	i.e. all the completion things want you to provide a (list ...)
Feb 22 21:45:53 <rpav>	this is incredibly inefficient because emacs implementation
Feb 22 21:46:12 <Odin-LAP>	rpav: Sorry, I was still talking about turning "a b c" into "a.*b.*c".
Feb 22 21:46:56 <rpav>	ooh
Feb 22 21:47:09 <rpav>	Odin-LAP: ivy does that right now at least with some $config
Feb 22 21:47:26 <Odin-LAP>	Oh, I'm aware. Also one of the main reasons I'm using it. :)
Feb 22 21:54:20 <bpalmer>	every program will evolve until it can send email^W^Whandle automatic completion.

Feb 22 21:56:57 <bpalmer>	 By the way, blue sky is apparently allowing federation now.
Feb 22 21:57:01 <thuna`>	Can you filter out internal symbols from apropos somehow?
Feb 22 21:58:29 <bpalmer>	thuna`: apropos has something to sort its results by match, so at the very least you should be able to move them to the end.
Feb 22 21:58:37 *	bpalmer hasn't explored this very deeply, though
Feb 22 21:59:17 <bpalmer>	ok, looks like some suitable advice on apropos-score-symbol might be the way to do this.
Feb 22 21:59:39 <bpalmer>	(of course, you'd also need to enable apropos-sort-by-scores)
Feb 22 22:00:28 <thuna`>	Hmm, you should advice whatever function's printing the entries at that point, no?
Feb 22 22:00:47 <edrx>	thuna`: I wrote several functions based on apropos a few weeks ago - http://anggtwu.net/eev-current/eev-blinks.el.html#find-eaproposf - so you need help to write something low-level, just tell
Feb 22 22:01:55 <thuna`>	edrx: Thanks, will do
Feb 22 22:03:09 <incal>	thuna`, there is `apropos-symbols-internal' that will "Filter out entries that are marked as apropos-inhibit"
Feb 22 22:03:32 <incal>	but I think it isn't meant to fiddle with from the outside since it doesn't even have a docstring. don't let that stop you tho
Feb 22 22:04:23 <bpalmer>	oh, that's another one that would b egood to advise with a :filter function, since it's given a list of symbols
Feb 22 22:04:28 <thuna`>	Yeah, that seems to be the one
Feb 22 22:04:39 <bpalmer>	:filter-args, rather
Feb 22 22:05:13 <bpalmer>	"Picard programming tip: The first version of any software will be buggy. That's why so many holodeck programs try to kill you."
Feb 22 22:06:01 <thuna`>	Although, you can also advice apropos-print with a :before and filter apropos-accumulator appropriately, which is a gloabal variable apropos uses to keep all the symbols (yuck!)

Feb 22 22:09:14 <technomancy>	the exact wrong message to send

Feb 22 22:11:45 <rpav>	our culture has a "fear the children" complex

Feb 22 22:12:20 <incal>	that everyone had a computer at home and in their pockets, and that those were connected to a network that was distributed (not a central supercomputer) tho, if someone wrote that in sf I'm unaware of it
Feb 22 22:12:27 <rpav>	bpalmer: hehe
Feb 22 22:12:32 <grym>	technomancy: and that's been reality since time immemorial
Feb 22 22:13:17 <incal>	Matrix 4 was good, I liked Bugs a lot

Feb 22 22:14:19 <grym>	i don't, but that's because i've read my neibuhr
Feb 22 22:15:23 <thuna`>	Ok, here's the full patch as far as apropos.el is concerned https://0x0.st/H5e-.txt and here's the full elisp to evaluate if you want it applied https://0x0.st/H5ei.txt

Feb 22 22:19:43 <Odin-LAP>	SF is usually more a commentary on the present than it ever can really be a prediction of the future, in any case.
Feb 22 22:19:46 <wgreenhouse>	Gibson's Sprawl stories/novels were pre-PC (only just) and certainly pre-most-people-having-internet. and the network in those is mostly a series of private fiefdoms (pretty good prediction as his tend to be)

Feb 22 23:02:03 <e1f>	i don't think it has to be qualified with "for now" as people have left and some are deleting their posts before leaving
Feb 22 23:02:47 <grym>	"deleting"
Feb 22 23:02:50 <corwin>	What part of that is supposed to make me think reddit will not be overwhemed with machine generated content?

Feb 22 23:03:06 <thuna`>	Ok, fixed version: https://0x0.st/H5ej.txt  Added a NOCOLOR option, so the previous example is now `M-: (th/org-completing-read-headlines nil t t) RET'

Feb 22 23:10:02 <incal>	maybe one can extend it to the physical world, so that one has a cat robot growing up among cats. will it behave like a cat after this? maybe one would have to simulate the cats so it can be there for several thousand years to perfect cat-ism
Feb 22 23:10:38 <grym>	incal: that's the embodiment criterion for robots, indeed

Feb 22 23:12:12 <alcor>	Speaking of LLMs, I'm looking into whether Emacs can be used as DJ software (or at least to interact with mixing programs), and it refers me to something called "Reuben Thomas's Mixxx.el" – does anyone has an idea where I can find this?
Feb 22 23:12:15 <alcor>	,g Is it possible to use Emacs as DJ software, and if so, what options do exist?
Feb 22 23:12:17 <fsbot>	🤖[g] While Emacs is not typically used as DJ software, there are some creative options like EMMS (Emacs Multimedia System) that can potentially be customized for music play and management within Emacs.
Feb 22 23:12:48 <corwin>	That looks like the right advice to me, fwiw.
Feb 22 23:13:16 <alcor>	Uh, I swear it offered a different advice in a /query session: https://pomf2.lain.la/f/tux77fqz.png
Feb 22 23:14:08 <corwin>	That seems possible.  I wouldn't assume we're having the same session in here as we in PM or #fsbot or whatjoinyou
Feb 22 23:14:38 <alcor>	So I can assume that Reuben Thomas's Mixxx.el doesn't exist? Now I'm sad :(
Feb 22 23:15:25 <corwin>	Let's think of it as waiting opportunity.  A blank canvas, if you will.
Feb 22 23:15:41 <incal>	fGnus, the Emacs Fake News client

Feb 22 23:17:24 <corwin>	look, we're not here to tell you how to live your life but something is either important enough to file a name change because of something GTP told you, or it isn't.
Feb 22 23:17:28 <mwnaylor>	I have used `progn', not really so much to capture the result, but to group expressions for the passing if form, etc. I understand, by reading the documentation, what `prog1' does, but don't have a good mental model for its use. Who has used it, and can you give a use-case?
Feb 22 23:17:30 <bpalmer>	,aumix-emacs
Feb 22 23:17:30 <fsbot>	aumix-emacs is at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/aumix-emacs
Feb 22 23:17:38 <rpav>	probably a bad sign i assumed they were 🤔
Feb 22 23:18:10 <bpalmer>	ah. probably aumix-emacs wasn't good enough to dj with, but it is said to be a mixer/volume adjuster
Feb 22 23:18:15 <rpav>	(though i acutally sortof assumed it was a mix name with country code)
Feb 22 23:18:23 <ram_man>	What prefix do you all usually use for keybindings that you create?
Feb 22 23:18:37 <bpalmer>	mwnaylor: prog1 is useful in the same way as,e.g., i++  if you know C, java, C++, etc.
Feb 22 23:18:44 <bpalmer>	mwnaylor: contrast with ++i
Feb 22 23:18:46 <incal>	mwnaylor, `prog1', after doing all the stuff, evaluate to the first (1) form, not the last (n) with `progn'
Feb 22 23:19:22 <alcor>	There's a somewhat popular DJ program called Mixxx https://mixxx.org/ - I assume "Mixxx" in "Mixx.el" is a reference to that
Feb 22 23:19:45 <incal>	(prog1 1 2 3) is 1, (progn 1 2 3) is 3
Feb 22 23:19:58 <thuna`>	Now, prog2, on the other hand *is* pretty much useless
Feb 22 23:20:01 <incal>	there is a `prog2' as well
Feb 22 23:20:06 <bpalmer>	mwnaylor: so, e.g., you might naturally do something like (while buffers (with-current-buffer (prog1 (car buffer) (setq buffers (cdr buffers)))) ...)
Feb 22 23:20:21 <bpalmer>	(car buffers), that is.
Feb 22 23:20:43 <thuna`>	That's the mechanism pop uses as well
Feb 22 23:21:52 <bpalmer>	thuna`: prog2 is (setup) (body) (cleanup)
Feb 22 23:22:01 <corwin>	When processing a list and trying to return a particular value (maybe not the list, itself) after,  I lean toward `dolist' since it happens to handle that exact case.
Feb 22 23:22:31 <incal>	the absence of "prog3" is an embarrassment to the Emacs community
Feb 22 23:22:37 <corwin>	(dolist (var list retval) &body)
Feb 22 23:22:43 <bpalmer>	much less common, but when you do have that case, quite useful. And how much better to illustrate the pattern than 1, 2, ... n then just 1 ... n
Feb 22 23:23:55 <mwnaylor>	bpalmer: Ok, can follow your (while buffers …) example. 𝗜 wouldn't write that kind of code, because I tend think in terms of immutability.
Feb 22 23:28:29 <e1f>	mission broadcast (or yt channel) https://www.nasa.gov/nasatv/
Feb 22 23:29:53 <bpalmer>	mwnaylor: for a long time, elisp didn't have fancy things like "dolist" , so you had to either use mapcar/mapc or do a while loop that does sets the list to a shorter and shorter value
Feb 22 23:30:22 <bpalmer>	the while loop that sets the list variable to a shorter and shorter value is a very clear recursive pattern, so probably counts as immutable enough.
Feb 22 23:30:40 <Odin-LAP>	CL is leaking quite strongly into elisp now, isn't it?
Feb 22 23:30:48 <incal>	now we have `dolist' and `cl-dolist', even
Feb 22 23:31:20 <incal>	Odin-LAP, yes, if you by CL means the Elisp that is cl-lib
Feb 22 23:31:41 <bpalmer>	Odin-LAP: yes, a lot of cl patterns and idioms have been flowing into elisp.
Feb 22 23:31:56 <bpalmer>	More and more keywords are become part of function patterns; someday defun may even support them.
Feb 22 23:32:09 <Odin-LAP>	incal: Honestly, I'm more concerned about the cultural aspects than the technical side of it, but...
Feb 22 23:32:18 <thuna`>	I hope that day comes soon.
Feb 22 23:32:49 <mwnaylor>	bpalmer: History lesson helps. I would have chosen the mapcar/mapc path.
Feb 22 23:33:11 *	Odin-LAP for some reason decided to learn CL before Emacs Lisp, so is not going to complain about CL influences.
Feb 22 23:33:22 <incal>	I think they are great
Feb 22 23:34:05 <incal>	there is `cl-defun' BTW, keywords are not what I like most about it tho
Feb 22 23:34:48 <incal>	I like simple things like `cl-incf' but also complicated/powerful things like `cl-loop'
Feb 22 23:34:58 <grym>	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Googlepayments.svg hahaha
Feb 22 23:34:59 <thuna`>	Yes, cl-defun is the workaround but I would prefer not having to double-check whether I can use keywords or defaults for optionals and whatnot
Feb 22 23:36:38 <incal>	it is a compromise, a few developers active on gmane.emacs.devel are very anti-CL and keywords are what they often focus on to criticize
Feb 22 23:37:02 <mwnaylor>	I think the loop/cl-loop way would be better than using while to keep shortening the list. And I am not a fan of loop.
Feb 22 23:37:20 <wgreenhouse>	alcor: so mixxx is apparently real and apparently does have some kind of tenuous emacs connection, in that they formally endorse emacs as an IDE for the project
Feb 22 23:37:39 <incal>	for everything simple with a list `dolist'/`cl-dolist' does it
Feb 22 23:37:42 <Odin-LAP>	Odd question: Would I be right to think that TRAMP strongly assumes the server end of an SSH connection is a Unix system?
Feb 22 23:37:51 <wgreenhouse>	(not clear there's actually a way to make music from emacs though)
Feb 22 23:37:56 <Odin-LAP>	And might behave weirdly if it runs into Windows on the far side?
Feb 22 23:37:59 <thuna`>	cl-do is my go-to unless it's literally (loop while ... collect ...)
Feb 22 23:38:32 <thuna`>	s/while/for ... in/
Feb 22 23:38:39 <wgreenhouse>	Odin-LAP: for the ssh-based backends, it assumes that the host has tools like base64 and ls
Feb 22 23:38:48 <wgreenhouse>	Odin-LAP: and /bin/sh
Feb 22 23:38:55 <incal>	just use any loop that works instead of over-theorize :)
Feb 22 23:39:14 <wgreenhouse>	Odin-LAP: SMB is also supported by tramp tho
Feb 22 23:39:21 <Odin-LAP>	wgreenhouse: So, yes, it's liable to misbehave if it runs into Windows.
Feb 22 23:39:44 <alcor>	wgreenhouse: Thanks, but I'm still puzzled as to why it hallucinates a Reuben Thomas into that 😆
Feb 22 23:39:52 <wgreenhouse>	Odin-LAP: for the ssh-based backends, yes
Feb 22 23:40:23 <wgreenhouse>	alcor: maybe he wrote a mode bundled with mixxx idk
Feb 22 23:40:36 <wgreenhouse>	mixxx itself does seem to be some big complex DAW
Feb 22 23:40:58 <Odin-LAP>	wgreenhouse: Hmm. It expects /bin/sh, you say? I wonder if I can tell it to use "wsl.exe" instead.
Feb 22 23:41:25 <Odin-LAP>	wgreenhouse: (I need to deal with a weird setup.)
Feb 22 23:41:26 <incal>	you can make music with Lisp and Emacs, https://www.audacity-forum.de/download/edgar/nyquist/nyquist-doc/examples/emacs/how-to/init-nyquist.html
Feb 22 23:41:35 <wgreenhouse>	Odin-LAP: if you've got a WSL and openssh I don't think this will be weird at all.
Feb 22 23:41:47 <wgreenhouse>	yes, see also ,,overtone,,
Feb 22 23:41:47 <fsbot>	overtone is a music synthesizer library in clojure. make your REPL bleep and blop. https://github.com/overtone/overtone
Feb 22 23:41:52 <mwnaylor>	Lurking on
Feb 22 23:42:01 <Odin-LAP>	wgreenhouse: Can't run the SSHd inside the WSL, for reasons.
Feb 22 23:42:08 <wgreenhouse>	Odin-LAP: ope
Feb 22 23:42:13 <wgreenhouse>	always reasons
Feb 22 23:42:38 <bpalmer>	thuna`: ! You're the first person I know who seems to like do.
Feb 22 23:42:42 *	Odin-LAP expects that one would have been more or less trivial.
Feb 22 23:43:03 <incal>	I think if one is serious about producing music one shouldn't care about the dream to do it with Lisp and/from Emacs, but instead use the industry stuff around, that way one will focus more on the music part
Feb 22 23:43:15 <mwnaylor>	#emacs, I used to think those writing major modes were crazy or masochistic. Now, on the cusp of creating my own, albeit very lightweight, have changed my mind. :-)
Feb 22 23:43:58 <wgreenhouse>	Odin-LAP: (info "(tramp) Predefined connection information") has some hints
Feb 22 23:44:07 <Odin-LAP>	bpalmer: In CL, do is fun but a little mindbending to remember how to use.
Feb 22 23:44:17 <wgreenhouse>	Odin-LAP: looks like you could indeed say call wsl.exe on connect
Feb 22 23:44:19 <thuna`>	bpalmer: It's quite elegant with the appropriate algorithms.  My only gripe with it is that you can't have the INIT form and the STEP form be identical without resorting to `#n=' and `#n#' but aside from that it's pretty neat
Feb 22 23:44:36 <wgreenhouse>	as the "login program" on the remote host
Feb 22 23:44:39 <wgreenhouse>	wild
Feb 22 23:45:08 <wgreenhouse>	or remote-shell rather
Feb 22 23:46:18 <wgreenhouse>	Odin-LAP: `direct-async-process` might also bupass some of the shellery if it's not needed, (info "(tramp) Remote processes")
Feb 22 23:46:22 <wgreenhouse>	*bypass
Feb 22 23:47:22 <Odin-LAP>	wgreenhouse: Thanks. It's evidently worth looking into, so I will. :)
Feb 22 23:52:02 <BigEatie>	The only place I'm messing with truncate-lines in my config is given here https://0x0.st/H5eg.txt however erc-mode still defaults truncate-lines to t. Anyone know what might be going on?
Feb 22 23:55:16 <thuna`>	BigEatie: set-default, as the name suggests, sets the default value of SYMBOL to VALUE, so any new buffers end up with SYMBOL set to VALUE.  You want setq-local instead.
Feb 22 23:56:06 <thuna`>	IIRC there was a function to map across same-level entries in org but I can't find it now, does anyone know it?

Feb 23 00:56:59 <Odin-LAP>	Hm, shr.el doesn't do inline SVG?
Feb 23 00:58:38 <technomancy>	Odin-LAP: it can do some inline SVG
Feb 23 00:58:50 <technomancy>	works on https://fennel-lang.org/survey/2023 for example
Feb 23 01:00:00 <Odin-LAP>	So it does. Interesting.

Feb 23 01:01:09 <incal>	Duration: 17:21:29
Feb 23 01:01:11 <Odin-LAP>	Might be there's too much CSS control over the stuff I'm using.
Feb 23 01:02:04 <technomancy>	Odin-LAP: yeah my SVG there is *very* simple
Feb 23 01:02:27 <Odin-LAP>	Which makes it prove the point quite nicely, though. :)
Feb 23 01:02:30 <technomancy>	https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/fennel-lang.org/tree/main/item/survey/chart.fnl
Feb 23 01:02:36 <technomancy>	SVG is underrated, for sure
Feb 23 01:04:42 *	Odin-LAP had a notion of using SVG as the basis for a GUI system back in 2002 or 2001.
Feb 23 01:04:56 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: well, especially when you get to use a lisp with a sxml-type representation to make it :)
Feb 23 01:05:07 <johnjaye>	it's not that supported is it? even on linux idk how to view them without inkscape
Feb 23 01:05:26 <technomancy>	=D
Feb 23 01:05:34 <wgreenhouse>	johnjaye: it works in the browser which is all that matters really
Feb 23 01:05:43 <johnjaye>	oh... hmm
Feb 23 01:06:44 <wgreenhouse>	maybe better in a browser than anywhere else as it is an xml _document_
Feb 23 01:06:58 <Odin-LAP>	SVG is actually stupid well supported, it's just not a banner feature of anything.
Feb 23 01:07:13 <technomancy>	I really ought to add some color to that page tho
Feb 23 01:07:39 <wgreenhouse>	Odin-LAP: still shocking that not every xmpp client will work with svg avatars :P
Feb 23 01:07:56 <wgreenhouse>	letting the xml side down
Feb 23 01:08:31 *	Odin-LAP managed to get the municipality to change the logo on their website from PNG to SVG by pointing out they already _had_ an SVG version that was smaller than the PNG, and it rendered better.
Feb 23 01:08:51 <wgreenhouse>	hah
Feb 23 01:09:14 <technomancy>	democracy works!!
Feb 23 01:09:43 <technomancy>	my favorite stupid fact about PNG is that the official logo for PNG actually renders terribly as a PNG and is much better as a JPG
Feb 23 01:09:52 <technomancy>	youhadonejob.gif
Feb 23 01:10:22 <bremner>	Let's send our CV to recruiters as animated gifs
Feb 23 01:10:40 <Odin-LAP>	technomancy: Dunno, it also helps that I a.) work for them and b.) shared classes in secondary school with the press officer, to whom I mentioned this personally. :p
Feb 23 01:12:03 <johnjaye>	but png is so portable! it's in the name!
Feb 23 01:12:24 <technomancy>	well, nepotism works too =)
Feb 23 01:12:28 <johnjaye>	is tiff lossless? hmmm
Feb 23 01:13:00 <Odin-LAP>	johnjaye: TIFF allows multiple compression formats, most of which are lossless.
Feb 23 01:13:30 <Odin-LAP>	johnjaye: However, JPEG is not, and it's fairly common in TIFF.
Feb 23 01:15:06 <bpalmer>	twb: one doesn't question how well a dog plays chess.
Feb 23 01:15:28 <johnjaye>	right. i mean it's nice to have one format for lossy and one for lossless
Feb 23 01:16:43 <e1f>	there was probably a good reason why they chose png over svg-- it's possible that at one time, one or more of the browsers they tested the site against couldn't render svg images. i speak from experience having received well-meaning suggestions from random people about how to improve things
Feb 23 01:18:44 <Odin-LAP>	e1f: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's actually the reason they had. That reason had just gone away by the point I brought it up, and I think I was careful to mention that I didn't think anyone had made a mistake.
Feb 23 01:19:43 <Odin-LAP>	(IIRC browser support tables suggested Safari as the likely culprit.)

Feb 23 01:40:02 <johnjaye>	btc-mode is all that comes to mind
Feb 23 01:40:52 <grym>	cuda.el

Feb 23 01:52:03 <grym>	ew, clowns
Feb 23 01:53:05 <incal>	jokers to the right
Feb 23 01:55:43 <grym>	apparently apple sports is eddie cue scratching an itch
Feb 23 01:55:50 <grym>	i can respect that
Feb 23 01:57:10 <johnjaye>	cudalisp
Feb 23 01:57:15 <bpalmer>	huh, a pretty bad Register op-ed, imo. And with obligatory Snowden weighing in on things for no apparent reason.
Feb 23 01:57:27 <johnjaye>	sounds like something that might exist
Feb 23 01:58:10 <bpalmer>	It sounds confused on both section 230 and content moderation.
Feb 23 01:59:09 <grym>	techdirt usually knows what's up in that regard
Feb 23 01:59:54 <grym>	i didn't actdually read through to the end, just noting that they yanked access after everyone's had their fun making gemini do stupid things
Feb 23 02:01:19 <bpalmer>	Yeah. But it's quoting from Paul Graham, Snowden, and various of the techno-"libertarian" sorts (just distinguishing from any True Libertarians)
Feb 23 02:03:06 <technomancy>	there's been a lot of shit takes about section 230 going around lately
Feb 23 02:03:09 <bpalmer>	No comments from, say, serious commenters on search engines or deep learning; or ethicists, law, or historians
Feb 23 02:03:12 <grym>	are they talking to themselves like elon was, apparently?
Feb 23 02:03:29 <incal>	but it was ages ago when you googled stuff and got all kinds of webpages, now you get 10 of the most posh mainstream magazines with articles all saying the same thing
Feb 23 02:04:29 <grym>	i see google search results increasingly rarely these days
Feb 23 02:04:39 <grym>	enough to notice how shit they've gotten
Feb 23 02:05:20 <incal>	you don't even have to google subversive stuff to see this, just google a Hollywood movie, you don't get the official homepage of that move but Wikipedia, IMDB and a bunch of review sites
Feb 23 02:05:39 <grym>	... movies still have homepages?
Feb 23 02:05:44 <bpalmer>	incal: to a certain extent, I'm fine with mainstream magazines over random domains that sound suspiciously ChatGPTy with no sign of their result provenance.
Feb 23 02:06:16 <bpalmer>	I *always* want an IMDB page when I search for a movie title
Feb 23 02:06:26 <bpalmer>	And when I don't, I want wikipedia, or rotten tomatoes.
Feb 23 02:07:06 <incal>	yeah, just saying Google hasn't led anyone to any exotic places for ages
Feb 23 02:07:15 <technomancy>	wired with it's completely pants-on-head section 230 take here https://www.wired.com/story/the-one-internet-hack-that-could-save-everything-section-230/
Feb 23 02:10:54 <incal>	when I was a kid I made a bunch of web pages about stuff that I liked, mainstream stuff like computer games and such stuff, those pages were horrible but I still got mails every day from people who had visited them. good luck getting anyone at all to ever visit such a page today
Feb 23 02:11:15 <bpalmer>	Oh, wow, Odysseus is on the moon. No telling how long the trip to Ithaca will take, but I'm sure Cornell will be filled with lazy layabouts wooing loves when it concludes.
Feb 23 02:11:20 <johnjaye>	we already know what the internet would be like pre-230. because 230 was created to address a specific problem
Feb 23 02:12:12 <grym>	bpalmer: let's shoot arrows through the gorges until the weather improves
Feb 23 02:12:56 <incal>	,g You can fire your arrows from the tower of Babel, but you can *never* strike god!
Feb 23 02:12:57 <fsbot>	🤖[g]  That's quite the lofty target!
Feb 23 02:13:14 <grym>	hanging the TAs even though they couldn't say no is strictly optional, though
Feb 23 02:28:02 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: it's like they're talking about taking away section 230 and replacing it with...marque and reprisal?
Feb 23 02:28:28 <wgreenhouse>	rudybot: yarr, we will extract the damages, even from without our own jurisdictionnnn
Feb 23 02:28:29 <rudybot>	wgreenhouse: yarr is also used in firefox
Feb 23 02:30:37 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: oh, they're explicit about the piracy, yuck.
Feb 23 02:31:12 <wgreenhouse>	> When the jurisprudential dust has cleared, the United States would be *exporting the democracy-promoting First Amendment to other countries rather than Section 230’s authoritarian-friendly liability shield* and the sewer of least-common-denominator content that holds human attention but does not bring out the best in us.
Feb 23 02:31:12 <wgreenhouse>	wtaf did I just read
Feb 23 02:32:56 <wgreenhouse>	also whatever this is: "A society must seek quality as a whole, as a shared cultural value, in order to maximize the benefits of AI."
Feb 23 02:33:57 <Inline>	the benefits of AI for the AI, the benefits of AI for some group, the benefits of AI for all
Feb 23 02:34:20 <wgreenhouse>	unknown
Feb 23 02:34:40 <wgreenhouse>	the benefits of AI to "a society," I think
Feb 23 02:35:34 <technomancy>	wgreenhouse: if I could CW a link in IRC I would have
Feb 23 02:35:42 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: that as a take was, yes, the pants are on their head, but also on fire (perhaps lit during too close proximity to a torch march)
Feb 23 02:35:56 <wgreenhouse>	the social engineering vibes are overwhelming
Feb 23 02:37:13 <technomancy>	wgreenhouse: one wonders who it was written for
Feb 23 02:37:37 <grym>	psyop to get people to read 'seeing like a state'
Feb 23 02:37:46 <grym>	reverse reverse psychology!
Feb 23 02:38:55 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: definitely someone's policy whitepaper, not even sure whose. could be sold to many with slight tweaks in emphasis
Feb 23 02:39:31 <technomancy>	remember when wired used to employ copy editors?
Feb 23 02:39:37 <wgreenhouse>	the new Cambridge Analytica, selling your country psychic security against the old edition
Feb 23 02:39:42 <technomancy>	or do like basic proofreading?
Feb 23 02:40:02 <grym>	technomancy: to the former; obviously not, they were printing neal stephenson in the 90s :)
Feb 23 02:40:12 <technomancy>	fair enough
Feb 23 02:40:12 <grym>	at his usual length!
Feb 23 02:40:25 <grym>	(the essay on fiber optic cables is still really good though)
Feb 23 02:41:18 <grym>	"Everything that has occurred in Silicon Valley in the last couple of decades also occurred in the 1850s. Anyone who thinks that wild-ass high tech venture capitalism is a late-20th-century California phenomenon needs to read about the maniacs who built the first transatlantic cable projects (I recommend Arthur C. Clarke's book How the World Was One). The only things that have changed since then are that the
Feb 23 02:41:25 <grym>	stakes have gotten smaller, the process more bureaucratized, and the personalities less interesting."
Feb 23 03:14:31 <wgreenhouse>	I wonder if emacs calendar/calc time calculation features support Martian sols
Feb 23 03:14:37 <wgreenhouse>	or lunar days
Feb 23 03:21:06 <grym>	(emacs) Other Calendars
Feb 23 03:21:36 <grym>	looks like no
Feb 23 03:27:43 <bpalmer>	rudybot: the most valuable calendar systems use money
Feb 23 03:27:44 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Valuable work, of course, but it's not a massive project that can solve some of our more vexing problems.
Feb 23 03:27:57 <bpalmer>	after all, time is money...
Feb 23 04:13:51 <bpalmer>	I can't believe I only discovered the g binding in grep and compilation buffers yesterday (it's bound to recompile aka "re-run the thing")
Feb 23 04:40:52 <technomancy>	it's a good one innit
Feb 23 05:23:56 <bpalmer>	rudybot: name your favorite key binding of the day.
Feb 23 05:23:56 <rudybot>	bpalmer: there could be text objects for those things. the text-object commands are grouped into "secondary-modals", and implemented as command overrides. when you hit 'd' in modal-cmd-mode, it puts you into modal-1off-kill-mode, which overrides commands like "next-line" to alternatives which find a text object corresponding to that movement. i went with this design because it automatically uses your favorite binding for "next-line"
Feb 23 06:04:49 <codingquark>	Good morning!

Feb 23 06:16:57 <codingquark>	:)
Feb 23 06:35:02 <kendell>	completely new to emacs itself. Impressed by all it can do. Trying to instal l emacspeak, a speech framework on top of emacs. Latest version, 53, refuses to bite compile. Emacs 29, ubuntu24.04. I can try again and paste the log if needed to troubleshoot
Feb 23 06:57:49 <bpalmer>	kendell: what's the first error shown?
Feb 23 07:37:32 <johnjaye>	24.04... like from the future?
Feb 23 07:39:13 <arch-angel>	anyone here using eglot + clangd? The error messages indicate (fix available) yet when I invoke the eglot-code-actions command I get no code actions available
Feb 23 07:39:48 <johnjaye>	clangd is all it lets you use though right?
Feb 23 07:41:20 <arch-angel>	johnjaye, when I was using lsp-mode I could access the code actions
Feb 23 07:41:31 <arch-angel>	but not with eglot
Feb 23 07:44:04 <johnjaye>	well. i should actually try it out so i can use it
Feb 23 07:52:57 <arch-angel>	johnjaye, hmm it's weird, there's a few errors that has code actions though
Feb 23 07:53:21 <arch-angel>	which means it's either eglot can only receive certain types of code actions
Feb 23 07:53:35 <johnjaye>	i mean that wouldn't surprise me. i've heard bugs in it before
Feb 23 07:53:53 <arch-angel>	is there any links to the discussion?
Feb 23 07:54:09 <arch-angel>	are*
Feb 23 07:54:50 <arch-angel>	this problem annoys me quite a lot cause I have clang-tidy enabled and I really cant be bothered to fix my 100 warnings manually
Feb 23 07:56:40 <johnjaye>	other than the github page for eglot if it exists idk. i just meant from people coming in here with complaints about it
Feb 23 07:57:34 <johnjaye>	can you make up a short minimal example to show the misbehavior?
Feb 23 08:02:19 <arch-angel>	right, just activate the modernize-* checks for clang-tidy and declare int main(){}
Feb 23 08:03:47 <arch-angel>	you should be getting a warning from the modernize-use-trailing-return-type check that int main() has some problem with it, and there's a (fix available) behind the error message
Feb 23 08:04:04 <arch-angel>	yet eglot-code-actions does not show anything
Feb 23 08:13:27 <yates_home>	i'm trying to install this: https://github.com/typst/svg2pdf/tree/main
Feb 23 08:13:47 <yates_home>	but it requires "cargo". what is that? i can't find a clear package for it under f39
Feb 23 08:14:08 <yates_home>	is it a rust thing?
Feb 23 08:15:19 <bpalmer>	cargo is a rust thing, yes.
Feb 23 08:16:56 <yates_home>	right. and i lied - f39 clearly has a cargo package.
Feb 23 08:17:12 <yates_home>	it was just hidden in about 300 false positives..
Feb 23 08:21:05 <yates_home>	thnk you, bpalmer
Feb 23 09:05:25 <danse-nr3>	,channel-wisdom
Feb 23 09:05:26 <fsbot>	it just uses more, which is usually less
Feb 23 09:13:51 <bpalmer>	it's all about the same , more or less
Feb 23 09:18:25 <roadie>	whats up with https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs ? loads without css and its animation.js ... or is it just my bleeding edge browser?
Feb 23 09:19:17 <roadie>	there is nothing there to make it so slow I thought
Feb 23 09:20:14 <roadie>	same on firefox - the internet is broken, who did this?
Feb 23 09:36:12 <needle>	yes, who did this on purposely intentionally broke this \o/ man.
Feb 23 09:36:22 <needle>	Now stand up WHO DID THIS?! >.>
Feb 23 09:36:26 <needle>	:) morn
Feb 23 09:37:02 <needle>	Obviously on technical problems, it is most important to find out who is to blame.
Feb 23 09:38:20 <edgar-rft>	currently https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs doiesn't loasd at all here, looks as if someone is working on it right now
Feb 23 09:40:17 <edgar-rft>	after some time I get ... network timeout - please try again later ...
Feb 23 09:46:21 <bpalmer>	Let's book a cabin by a lake for our timeout.
Feb 23 09:47:05 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: we're sorry to tell that emacs no longer exists
Feb 23 09:47:05 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: I was born in a country which no longer exists, I live in Germany and I use the US layout :p
Feb 23 09:52:43 <jbe>	I think rudybot may actually be german
Feb 23 09:53:52 <needle>	Zee german rudyboot
Feb 23 09:58:52 <bpalmer>	rudybot: tell us about the blinkenlichten
Feb 23 09:58:52 <rudybot>	bpalmer: A dark theme is useful, I guess, but I would never consider that a significant issue (or vice-versa), assuming basic readability. But I also don't get why people care about the multicolored blinkenlichten on their gaming PCs
Feb 23 09:59:08 <edgar-rft>	in germany you might need to pay speculation tax for using foreign property
Feb 23 10:05:16 <needle>	rudybot: Tell us about the most "geheim german plan"
Feb 23 10:05:16 <rudybot>	needle: if you were going for a german-language joke, it would have been "plan nein"
Feb 23 10:06:08 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: that was even worse than my own jokes
Feb 23 10:06:08 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: it's even worse, rudybot already told me my own lame jokes :-)
Feb 23 10:06:49 <needle>	rudybot: How does "Sauerkraut, Wurst und Bier" taste like?
Feb 23 10:06:50 <rudybot>	needle: Bier und Wurst
Feb 23 10:13:40 <roadie>	ok somebody fixed it. the internet is back.
Feb 23 10:14:25 <roadie>	rudybot is from yugoslavia?

Feb 23 11:36:32 <Bounga>	Hello, I just upgraded to Emacs 29.1 from 28 and now LSP doesn't work anymore. If I try to M-x any LSP command I got `cl-generic-ensure-function: lsp-execute-command is already defined as something else than a generic function`. I really don't understand what that means. Any clue?
Feb 23 11:47:37 <supercode>	What's a good way to learn more about Emacs like learn stuff that might not even know exists?
Feb 23 11:48:06 <johnjaye>	i'm not sure, but that sounds like other function definition errors people got going to 29
Feb 23 11:49:00 <alcor>	does 29 change anything in that regard?
Feb 23 11:49:07 <supercode>	like articles or tutorials that tell me something like -- Here are some things in Emacs everyone uses but it is possible you might not be aware of them.
Feb 23 11:56:51 <ski>	supercode : hang around in this channel ?
Feb 23 12:00:12 <supercode>	ski: thanks. I visit this channel many times every week.

Feb 23 12:05:57 <bremner>	there is, iirc
Feb 23 12:06:21 <johnjaye>	well i mispoke, i meant 28
Feb 23 12:06:32 <johnjaye>	not sure what major changes to 29 would be relevant other than eglot being introduced

Feb 23 15:19:39 <grym>	hah!  i was trying to figure out what blogging backend https://two-wrongs.com/  uses -- aaand it's org-publish.
Feb 23 15:21:55 <graywolf>	Hello :)  How can I get a source code of a function as a string (preferably, but sexp would also work)?
Feb 23 15:22:17 <supercode>	grym: how did you figure it is org-publish?
Feb 23 15:22:24 <grym>	supercode: emailed the author
Feb 23 15:22:34 <supercode>	oh I also see this in view source: <meta name="generator" content="Org Mode" />
Feb 23 15:22:41 <grym>	supercode: .. but also, if you look at the page source, you'll see <meta name="generator" content="Org Mode" />
Feb 23 15:22:46 <grym>	yep
Feb 23 15:23:04 <supercode>	do you check the blogging backend of every blog you come across? any other interesting ones you found?
Feb 23 15:23:09 <grym>	i don't, usually
Feb 23 15:23:18 <grym>	but i like the tufte-like sidenotes he's got going on
Feb 23 15:23:34 <supercode>	interesting.
Feb 23 15:23:35 <grym>	and i'm looking for a way to write up some reenactment work i'm doing that fits my workflow
Feb 23 15:23:45 <supercode>	found this blog yesterday for useless use of cats article
Feb 23 15:23:51 <grym>	yeah, it was on HN
Feb 23 16:16:38 <kiliro>	saluton
Feb 23 16:17:24 <kiliro>	,ping
Feb 23 16:17:24 <fsbot>	␕
Feb 23 16:21:03 <restoration>	ls
Feb 23 16:21:05 <restoration>	hello
Feb 23 16:21:10 <restoration>	anyone here
Feb 23 16:24:04 <grym>	no
Feb 23 16:24:09 <kiliro>	LOL
Feb 23 16:32:04 <grym>	,crickets
Feb 23 16:32:05 <fsbot>	*chirp*, *chirp*, *chirp*
Feb 23 16:34:43 <kiliro>	which is the correct way for erc to login to a bouncer such as znc when it is connected to several networks?  I could achieve it by login in to the znc server and jumping to another network...then joining again and jumping to yet another network....when the last network is the default...I do not jump
Feb 23 16:34:44 <jbe>	it's just the one guy in here talking via hundreds of accounts
Feb 23 16:35:18 <kiliro>	that is the usual traffic near weekend
Feb 23 16:35:25 <kiliro>	and during weekend
Feb 23 16:35:50 <grym>	jbe: oh just like elon
Feb 23 16:36:23 <jbe>	yes, but more imaginative
Feb 23 16:37:53 <jbe>	I don't actually know how irc bouncers work since I've basically only ever done screen+irssi, but don't those support just the one connection from you to them and then the bouncer manages multiple servers somehow?
Feb 23 16:38:59 <grym>	no idea, i do the same as you
Feb 23 16:39:01 <jbe>	would at least be a lot less of a hassle than having you on your actual client reconnecting to n>1 bouncer-connections whenever
Feb 23 16:42:10 <hodapp>	I know weechat can act as an IRC bouncer but I've yet to try to set it up
Feb 23 16:42:13 <hodapp>	have only used its relay
Feb 23 16:43:29 <corwin>	i use znc for a bouncer; basically I'm able to connect to that bouncer (from several clients at the same time, if I wish) as my znc user.  that user has zome IRC connections attached to it.  I can connect to znc to hit a specific one of these connections, or without and then switch between them using special commands ZNC intercepts.
Feb 23 16:43:43 <hodapp>	dumb question: I just installed embark, but I see embark-act opens a new buffer... how do I interact with this buffer, e.g. to scroll it?
Feb 23 16:43:48 <hodapp>	it disappears if I click on it.
Feb 23 16:46:19 <kiliro>	corwin: how do you connect to serveral networks of the same znc server at the same time with erc?
Feb 23 16:46:30 <jbe>	oh, that reminds me I put in my calendar to renew the auth cert I use for libera and that date is coming up. so I guess I'll have to refresh my memory on how I did that last time (and maybe do a longer expiry so I can completely forget)
Feb 23 16:46:52 <kiliro>	write a guide, jbe
Feb 23 16:46:53 <jbe>	well, ok, it's in may
Feb 23 16:47:00 <pkal>	hodapp: I think you can use M-v or C-M-v?
Feb 23 16:47:08 <kiliro>	and link it to the notification in the calendar
Feb 23 16:47:10 <jbe>	kiliro: guide is at https://libera.chat/guides/certfp
Feb 23 16:47:23 <kiliro>	good
Feb 23 16:47:49 <hodapp>	pkal: no luck, just tries to move the buffer I hit embark-act from
Feb 23 16:47:58 <corwin>	kiliro: I have a sep interactive function to connect to each given network.  https://git.sr.ht/~mplscorwin/dotfiles/tree/master/item/elisp/init-erc-30.el#L324
Feb 23 16:48:44 <pkal>	(the buffer is one of the reasons I dislike embark)
Feb 23 16:48:50 <kiliro>	mojose (marvelous), corwin
Feb 23 16:49:00 <hodapp>	pkal: I just figured I'd try it out. Do you have something else you prefer instead, or just nothing?
Feb 23 16:49:02 <corwin>	I run ERC in a dedicated Emacs (vs the main one I use for most things), so I can then connect when launching Emacs with a shortcut like this (Window, alas): H:\install\emacs-30-4a8d3c\bin\runemacs.exe -fs -l init-erc-30 -eval "(condition-case err (libera-irc) (efnet-irc) (perl-irc) )"
Feb 23 16:49:03 <jbe>	in *theory* it should be just generating a new cert, adding the fingerprint to nickserv, and replacing the old file. but I guess we'll see when I get around to it
Feb 23 16:49:55 <pkal>	hodapp: C-M-v appears to work for me.
Feb 23 16:50:06 <hodapp>	pkal: in embark?
Feb 23 16:50:29 <pkal>	hodapp: Yes, I do M-x embark-act and can scroll the pop-up buffer using C-M-v
Feb 23 16:51:01 <pkal>	I use my own package, do-at-point, which just implements what I need ^^
Feb 23 16:51:06 <kiliro>	I did not find auth-for function in the documentation, corwin
Feb 23 16:52:01 <kiliro>	otherwise, everything else is very clear, corwin
Feb 23 16:52:07 <hodapp>	pkal: hm, definitely not working for me
Feb 23 16:52:34 <pkal>	hodapp: do you have some special window-placment configuration?
Feb 23 16:52:44 <corwin>	kiliro: it's up a few lines in the same file
Feb 23 16:53:37 <hodapp>	pkal: I have various other windows open... if I make my frame tiny (so I have to scroll)' and open nothing else, *then* C-M-v works
Feb 23 16:54:17 <pkal>	hodapp: that sounds like you don't have to scroll in the first place, or am I misunderstanding you?
Feb 23 16:55:27 <hodapp>	pkal: well, I ran into this yesterday on a smaller monitor and more windows and so forth, and jotted the problem down to look at later
Feb 23 16:55:48 <hodapp>	when trying to reproduce it now it'd often open the buffer to where I don't need to scroll at all
Feb 23 17:04:13 <corwin>	kiliro: ftr, I probably stole that auth-for approach, if not quite the function, from bandali hwvr I'm not finding where I stashed the link to his conf that I cribbed from.
Feb 23 17:11:57 <jvml>	hello again!
Feb 23 17:12:19 <hodapp>	O HAI!
Feb 23 17:12:38 <jvml>	how goes it?
Feb 23 17:13:10 <hodapp>	kicking ass and reading research papers, and I'm all outta ass
Feb 23 17:13:36 <jvml>	what kind of research papers? i was going to read some linguistics-related ones soon
Feb 23 17:13:49 <jvml>	(and some classical philology for that matter)
Feb 23 17:13:59 <hodapp>	machine learning - specifically OWLv2, OWL-ViT, and CLIP
Feb 23 17:14:17 <jvml>	i'm a bit out of the loop on ML but i'm sure it's fun to read about
Feb 23 17:14:38 <hodapp>	the approach in CLIP is from 2021 but it's a very neat one
Feb 23 17:14:38 <corwin>	My band is playing a couple songs tonight at the memorial for our bassist who died last Monday.  livestream 18:00 America/Chicago https://firstunitarian.org/live/
Feb 23 17:14:48 <hodapp>	:[
Feb 23 17:15:12 <corwin>	ya; thx
Feb 23 17:15:14 <jvml>	sincerest condolences.
Feb 23 17:15:22 <corwin>	Thanks jvml.
Feb 23 17:15:24 <jvml>	will keep this in mind later tonight
Feb 23 17:15:54 <grym>	hodapp: we were thinking about using clip to augment some classification analysis
Feb 23 17:16:30 <jvml>	reading about CLIP now, albeit probably not in nearly as much depth as you hodapp
Feb 23 17:16:54 <jvml>	seems very useful
Feb 23 17:16:54 <hodapp>	grym: I tried OWLv2 and the stock models are doing a great job of finding everything but the target
Feb 23 17:17:26 <grym>	"find me the ones with telephone poles in 'em"
Feb 23 17:17:31 <grym>	... maybe doable?
Feb 23 17:17:32 <hodapp>	we're again stuck in 'customer is giving us a tiny amount of data and telling us that even in this we're not allowed to use the labels for classes D and E'
Feb 23 17:17:50 <grym>	i'm stuck in "lidar is noisy"
Feb 23 17:17:59 <hodapp>	this is potato-quality MWIR data
Feb 23 17:18:29 <grym>	we have really high quality lidar... it's just that sometimes the GPS lies, so photogrammetry is harder than it should be
Feb 23 17:18:32 <hodapp>	video data from 3-4 distinct scenes, and their great idea was 'don't even pull train, val, and test from the same ones'
Feb 23 17:18:43 <grym>	that's a _great_ idea!
Feb 23 17:19:18 <jvml>	i love potato-quality digital things just in general
Feb 23 17:19:26 <jvml>	from an artistic perspective thouggh
Feb 23 17:19:29 <jvml>	though*
Feb 23 17:19:29 <hodapp>	one of our competitors may or may not be L3 who has all their own sensors and infinity billion examples of both synthetic and real data
Feb 23 17:19:36 <jvml>	definitely not as an analyst
Feb 23 17:19:39 <hodapp>	jvml: if doing potato quality, why not go for film?
Feb 23 17:20:01 <grym>	hodapp: well if  it all goes tits up you know where to find me
Feb 23 17:20:07 <jvml>	funny story, i actually really like the quality imparted by old and cheap digital cameras onto video
Feb 23 17:20:07 <grym>	we have new and different pain!
Feb 23 17:20:27 <hodapp>	grym: hah, appreciated, but stuff's going fine here for now. the company has a whole lot of projects funding things right now
Feb 23 17:20:32 <jvml>	i'm very fond of film but digital video is cosmopolitan and just as easy to mess with creatively
Feb 23 17:20:50 <hodapp>	jvml: digital to me just always had way less interesting ways of fux0ring up the image
Feb 23 17:21:02 <grym>	hodapp: i have a wandb s a l e s  c a l l  shortly
Feb 23 17:21:21 <jvml>	still digital collage can get really messy when you intentionally glitch it out
Feb 23 17:21:37 <jvml>	basically all of my visual art is digital collage
Feb 23 17:22:09 <hodapp>	grym: do you remember offhand what those networks were where you give it input images *and* some kind of engineered attributes about inputs, and get it to automagically hallucinate new inputs at anywhere you pick in those attributes?
Feb 23 17:22:26 <hodapp>	not exactly GANs and not exactly diffusion models, but also not exactly *not* those
Feb 23 17:23:26 <hodapp>	'engineered attributes' might be the wrong term, but just attributes like 'image 1 has foo=10 bar=5. image 2 has foo=-10 bar=5. image 3 has foo=0 bar=3', repeat ad infinitum, now ask it what it thinks an image is with foo=-5 bar=0
Feb 23 17:23:27 <jvml>	me and my friends would work with the distinctive shortcomings found in GANs a few years back to create visuals
Feb 23 17:23:49 <jvml>	like back in 2021 they all created delicious nonsense
Feb 23 17:23:59 <jvml>	crazy how far things have come since then
Feb 23 17:24:04 <hodapp>	I didn't do much with GANs but back around 2016 I messed with style transfer
Feb 23 17:24:13 <hodapp>	which I think is not *that* far off from current diffusion techniques
Feb 23 17:24:23 <jvml>	we actually named one of our bands after StyleGAN
Feb 23 17:24:38 <grym>	hodapp: i don't recall, no
Feb 23 17:24:41 <hodapp>	dang
Feb 23 17:26:28 <thuna`>	graywolf: Try symbol-function
Feb 23 17:26:59 <thuna`>	Byte-compile can mess it up though
Feb 23 17:32:40 <johnjaye>	is there a way to make neural networks useful on a small scale, like for analyzing a document?
Feb 23 17:33:09 <hodapp>	johnjaye: analyzing it for what in particular?
Feb 23 17:33:13 <johnjaye>	like say you wanted to rank some parts of the emacs manual as more useful than others and have a search function that prioritized those sections first for keywords
Feb 23 17:33:19 <hodapp>	hmmm
Feb 23 17:33:29 <johnjaye>	or would that just be like a linked list and you wouldn't bother with a nn
Feb 23 17:33:56 <hodapp>	that depends a lotf on how 'useful' is defined. for some kinds, older 'classical' ML and non-ML can get you very good metrics without needing an NN at all
Feb 23 17:34:06 <hodapp>	for others, might need a newfangled LLM
Feb 23 17:34:22 <graywolf>	thuna`: Ah, that does seem to work.  When I tried it before, I think I got back #<symr ...>, so I must have been doing something wrong.  Now it works :)
Feb 23 17:34:55 <thuna`>	graywolf: No, you probably weren't doing something wrong, symbol-function is just not very reliable
Feb 23 17:35:40 <graywolf>	That is... comforting? :D  Well, I will try to figure out solution without it
Feb 23 17:35:56 <grym>	certainly the newfangled hotness is running a local model against small data
Feb 23 17:36:18 <grym>	llms "are good at this" because their pretraining is across a very large corpus
Feb 23 17:36:44 <johnjaye>	i thought ML and NN were synonymous
Feb 23 17:36:53 <grym>	no
Feb 23 17:36:56 <johnjaye>	hodapp: i mean purely subjectively based on user feedback
Feb 23 17:37:09 <johnjaye>	as in i searched term x and found the most useful result on page 52
Feb 23 17:37:26 <grym>	ML is vaguely defined; NN refers to a particular architectural family of statistical analysis tools
Feb 23 17:38:17 <thuna`>	graywolf: Although it is weird that you got #<...>.  To my knowledge that's invalid syntax.
Feb 23 17:39:32 <hodapp>	johnjaye: so, for about the past decade, "AI" and more so "ML" overwhelmingly refer to deep neural networks, but both terms have a history of many other architectures/methods
Feb 23 17:40:28 <kiliro>	sorry for your bassist, corwin
Feb 23 17:40:52 <kiliro>	what did [s]he die of?
Feb 23 17:40:53 <hodapp>	johnjaye: you'll see 'shallow' ML referring to older methods - things like SVMs, xgboost, decision trees, and older neural network styles
Feb 23 17:41:06 <thuna`>	graywolf: Hmm, it seems #<...> is the syntax used for non-lisp objects, so I guess whatever function you were checking for was an external function?
Feb 23 17:41:30 <graywolf>	thuna`: It was #<subr ...> I think (now when I try to google it)
Feb 23 17:41:33 <grym>	let's insist that MCMCs are DL of indeterminate depth
Feb 23 17:41:44 *	hodapp insists on smacking grym
Feb 23 17:42:03 <grym>	ah ah ah, you can only smack me based on where i am, not where i've beeeeeennnnnn
Feb 23 17:42:20 <thuna`>	Ah, ok, subr's are non-lisp functions as well
Feb 23 17:42:45 <thuna`>	(Or maybe they are *the* non-lisp functions?)
Feb 23 17:44:43 <johnjaye>	so which method would be most applicable for a fuzzy search/index type thing?
Feb 23 17:44:44 <graywolf>	Sadly I cannot really recall what symbol I used to test it...  But it works now, so ... :)
Feb 23 17:44:54 <johnjaye>	i.e. something you would train by telling it which terms had higher rank?
Feb 23 17:45:50 <thuna`>	graywolf: ,,(symbol-function 'car)
Feb 23 17:45:50 <fsbot>	Output error: Output was not in {symbol, string, number, nil, list}. You might want to try (format "%S" (whatever you were doing))
Feb 23 17:46:18 <thuna`>	,(prin1-to-string (symbol-function 'car))
Feb 23 17:46:19 <fsbot>	ERROR: Symbol’s function definition is void: fs-prin1-to-string
Feb 23 17:46:35 <thuna`>	You get the point.
Feb 23 17:46:36 <hodapp>	grym: hm, I see YOLOv9 dropped too
Feb 23 17:46:47 <graywolf>	#<subr car> I see
Feb 23 17:47:01 <graywolf>	Yeah, so I just picked wrong function for the test I did
Feb 23 17:47:11 <grym>	hodapp: orly
Feb 23 17:47:30 <thuna`>	graywolf: You can check it with `subrp' before passing it to `symbol-function'
Feb 23 17:47:52 *	grym pip install --upgrade ultralytics
Feb 23 17:48:25 <hodapp>	haven't kept up on the new YOLOs, though. still using YOLOX here...
Feb 23 17:48:26 <graywolf>	Interesting, (subrp 'car) returns nil
Feb 23 17:48:34 <grym>	ultralytics v8 is p good
Feb 23 17:48:46 <grym>	but we're slamming on lidar right now so i've let it drop a bit
Feb 23 17:48:53 <grym>	.. until our photogrammetry guys can stop sucking
Feb 23 17:49:26 <grym>	it's nice to be blocked and have it be 100% not my fault and not my job to fix :P
Feb 23 17:51:36 <hodapp>	we've not dealt much with LIDAR here - at least on the ML side. our performance modeling group deals with that stuff maybe - and the other division of the company sometimes
Feb 23 17:51:49 <thuna`>	It is weird that (special-form-p 'car) is also nil
Feb 23 17:52:15 <thuna`>	...and (special-form-p 'if) too.  Is that a bug?
Feb 23 17:53:20 <grym>	hodapp: it's an interesting world, so far
Feb 23 17:53:29 <grym>	very much learning as i go
Feb 23 17:54:34 <thuna`>	Not `car', but `if' is explicitly a special form according to (info "(elisp) Special Forms") and its ,,df if
Feb 23 17:54:35 <fsbot>	if is a special form in ‘C source code’.
Feb 23 17:54:35 <fsbot>	(if COND THEN ELSE...)
Feb 23 17:54:35 <fsbot>	If COND yields non-nil, do THEN, else do ELSE...
Feb 23 17:54:35 <fsbot>	Returns the value of THEN or the value of the last of the ELSE’s. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Feb 23 17:55:03 <thuna`>	,(or (special-form-p 'if) (special-form-p #'if))
Feb 23 17:55:04 <fsbot>	:(   Symbol’s function definition is void: fs-special-form-p
Feb 23 17:55:21 <graywolf>	thuna`: (special-form-p 'if) gives t on 29.1
Feb 23 17:55:55 <thuna`>	It was nil for me just a second ago, I thought, but it's t now.  I guess I was evaluating the wrong thing?
Feb 23 17:56:23 <thuna`>	Yeah, I was looking at subr-primitive-p.  My bad!
Feb 23 18:08:36 <hab25>	Hi, I'm trying to get rid of this `eval` here so that the byte compiler can lint the form given to the `eval`. I don't want to turn `my/setq-with-boundp-and-type-check` is a macro. `my/activate-mark-and-arrange-for-handling-by-shift-selection-if-enabled` into a macro. What options do I have?
Feb 23 18:08:42 <hab25>	(defun my/activate-mark-and-arrange-for-handling-by-shift-selection-if-enabled ()   (activate-mark)   (when shift-select-mode     (eval      ;; see source of `#'handle-shift-selection`      `(my/setq-with-boundp-and-type-check        ,(make-local-variable 'transient-mark-mode) `(only . t)))))
Feb 23 18:09:11 <hab25>	Uh, looks like the code came out badly formatted. Sorry about that
Feb 23 18:11:08 <hab25>	important: there should be a newline after `#'handle-shift-selection` comment
Feb 23 18:11:55 <hab25>	that is, right after "`#'handle-shift-selection`"
Feb 23 18:12:21 <corwin>	You look to be calling `make-local-variable' at compile time, rather than returning code from your macro to do that when the form created by using the macro is evaluated.  Why ,(make-local-variable ...)   or really... why defmacro, at all?
Feb 23 18:13:02 <corwin>	erm.  wait.  You have here a defun.  But you return a form from it?  Maybe just get rid of all the `   and  ,   and see if that is any closer?
Feb 23 18:13:09 <hab25>	AFAIU all of the code there is at runtime, it is inside a `defun`
Feb 23 18:14:35 <corwin>	FWIW, it's not very helpful (at least for me) to wrap your code in markdown.  It's just more to parse.  There's a pastebin in /topic if you want to show the formatting.
Feb 23 18:15:15 <hab25>	It doesn't return a form, it return whatever the result of (eval `(my/setq-with-boundp-and-type-check ...)) is
Feb 23 18:15:26 <hab25>	Thanks. I'll use the pastebin

Feb 23 18:16:59 <thuna`>	hab25: If the only thing you are doing is ensuring transient-mark-mode is local before doing whatever the macro is doing (putting aside whether it needs to be a macro to begin with) then you can do (make-local-variable 'transient-mark-mode) and then do (my/setq-with-boundp-and-type-check transient-mark-mode '(only . t))
Feb 23 18:17:02 <corwin>	I think you want let.
Feb 23 18:18:32 <corwin>	Maybe I misunderstand why you are trying to make-local-variable here but did you consider something like:   (when shift-select-mode (let ((transient-mark-mode (only . t))) (do-more-stuff)))
Feb 23 18:20:26 <thuna`>	corwin's suggestion is probably what you are looking for but it would be nice if you could explain the context behind this snippet.
Feb 23 18:21:26 <hab25>	thuna`: thanks, your solution is an improvement. I'd love it if I could avoid writing "transient-mark-mode" twice though since that is more error prone. In this case my `my/setq-with-boundp-and-type-check` does a `boundp` check practically eliminates the chance of a mistyping error (you'd have to mistype to another bound symbol)
Feb 23 18:22:31 <hab25>	thuna: but nonetheless it would be cool if there was a solution for this typing twice problem that worked in the general case where there is not a `boundp` check afterwords
Feb 23 18:23:01 <corwin>	Isn't transient-mark-mode the mode var for transient mark, a global minor mode, thus always buffer local?
Feb 23 18:24:05 <hab25>	thuna`: The reason `my/setq-with-boundp-and-type-check` is a macro is to mirror the interface of `setq`. This is only possible through a macro since `setq` is a special form
Feb 23 18:24:20 <corwin>	Hmm.  Disabling it gives me "disabled" not "disabled in current buffer", so perhaps not.
Feb 23 18:24:58 <thuna`>	corwin: transient-mark-mode doesn't seem to be buffer-local, since it's dv doesn't have a "this variable automatically becomes buffer-local when set"
Feb 23 18:25:48 <corwin>	hab25: So, it's to avoid having to quote the symbol given as the first arg? (FTR, I think I asked "why a macro" first ;)
Feb 23 18:26:25 <thuna`>	hab25: That "mistype-protection" is very much not a good idea.  As for `-and-type-check', it's not obvious to me how you would specify how to type-check with how you are calling the macro, so it seems overall redundant
Feb 23 18:27:36 <hab25>	corwin: regarding local transient mark mode, see https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/c0d7f7fc54f6c67f409e75f20ebb4420d96c71a6/lisp/simple.el#L7435
Feb 23 18:28:53 <hab25>	thuna`: why is it not a good idea?
Feb 23 18:30:21 <thuna`>	If you can't trust the developer to not mistype variable names, how can you trust them to write working code?
Feb 23 18:31:18 <hab25>	Trust is not absolute, humans make mistakes. That is part of the motivation for writing tests.
Feb 23 18:31:29 <thuna`>	Or are you accepting arbitrary variable names from the user and setting those?  If so, the check for that should be the first thing you do.
Feb 23 18:31:35 <hab25>	Trust shouldn't be absolute*
Feb 23 18:32:59 <corwin>	hab25: the emacs sources you link make sense: they depend on set-local to ensure transient-mark-mode is buffer local.
Feb 23 18:36:34 <corwin>	btw, here is the same link pointing to the authoritative repo: https://git.sv.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/simple.el#n7435
Feb 23 18:38:44 <corwin>	(if you needed that particular rev you could tack on id=c0d7f7 or smth)
Feb 23 18:38:53 <hab25>	I think I made a mistake in not providing a minimal question and providing too much distracting tangential code. Here's a better one: is there a way I can `setq` a dynamically named variable without using `eval`? I.e. not e.g. (eval `(setq ,my-var my-val))?
Feb 23 18:39:13 <e1f>	wow, is that the longest named function evar?
Feb 23 18:39:22 <corwin>	We use set instead of setq when the name isn't a symbol known at design time, I think.
Feb 23 18:39:30 <hab25>	I usually go to github first so I can use its search, e.g. https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aemacs-mirror%2Femacs+foobar&type=code
Feb 23 18:40:13 <corwin>	fair enough. i tend to use grep and so forth on the full sources so i can do all the for emacs.

Feb 23 18:40:34 <grym>	,rgel <3
Feb 23 18:40:35 <fsbot>	grym, rgel: rg.el is an Emacs search package based on the ripgrep command line tool. It allows you to interactively create searches, doing automatic searches based on the editing context, refining and modifying search results and much more. It is also highly configurable to be able to fit different users’ needs. (https://rgel.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.3/)
Feb 23 18:40:41 <thuna`>	(And `set' only sets the value globally AFAIK)
Feb 23 18:40:44 <hab25>	corwin: right, me too, but then I don't get a shareable link
Feb 23 18:41:30 <corwin>	For me links like this are clickable (I'm using ERC 5.6-git for Emacs 30.0.50):  (info "(elisp)")
Feb 23 18:41:55 <thuna`>	Actually, no, set works for buffer-locals if I'm reading set_internal right
Feb 23 18:43:19 <hab25>	corwin: I mean, comparing to github search, simply grepping does not as-easily lead you to a shareable http link that you can paste here
Feb 23 18:43:33 <grym>	you could kind of munge something by introspecting your remote url
Feb 23 18:44:36 <hab25>	thuna`: that is my understanding as well. It skips lexically-bound vars though, which is why I avoid it (and answers your previous "why a macro?" questions: because I must use `setq`).
Feb 23 18:45:15 <thuna`>	hab25: Binding arbitrary symbols does not land itself well to lexical-binding
Feb 23 18:45:22 <corwin>	Perhaps it just doesn't come up for me much that I want to link to a emacs source file vs a command/function, binding, or info section.  We have fsbot (,,botsnack,,) that gives us ,df <fun> ,dk <key seq> and I've already shown how I like to link info.
Feb 23 18:45:23 <fsbot>	yum! ...I mean, apt!
Feb 23 18:46:26 <hab25>	grym: you could, but I haven't. If there's a package that does that out-of-the-box I'd love to hear about it
Feb 23 18:47:25 <grym>	hab25: me too!
Feb 23 18:47:35 <grym>	i swear i saw something like it once but .. whoosh
Feb 23 18:47:57 <hab25>	corwin: that runs into the problem that e.g. fsbot's  version of the code might not be the one you want to refer to. Most of the time that's fine though
Feb 23 18:48:29 <corwin>	absolutely true!  we do run into that quite a bit.
Feb 23 18:48:44 <corwin>	Not as often as botch color codes.  But it happens.
Feb 23 18:49:22 <thuna`>	hab25: In general I would answer your question with "Don't do it" but if you really really must then the only options I can think of are `set' if you can disregard lexical bindings and `eval' if you cannot.

Feb 23 18:51:13 <hab25>	grym: is your usage of "whoosh" meant to represent sound of the memory leaving your head? Usually I see that instead used to indicate that somebody failed to understand something

Feb 23 18:51:32 <grym>	hab25: in this case, it means i lost the reference not that a joke went over my head
Feb 23 18:51:55 <incal>	I'm not getting it
Feb 23 18:52:38 <hab25>	thuna`: thanks, I was afraid that might be the case. These's a third option which will likely be my path forward as it's the least undesirable: turning #'my/activate-mark-and-arrange-for-handling-by-shift-selection-if-enabled into a macro
Feb 23 18:52:49 <hab25>	grym: I see, thanks
Feb 23 18:52:59 <corwin>	thuna`, hab25: I wonder if one could git rid of the eval by making the defun also a macro, thus deferring execution.
Feb 23 18:53:50 <hab25>	corwin: yep, we just said the same thing in close time-proximity
Feb 23 18:54:38 <corwin>	oh, yup, yup.  good idea :P
Feb 23 18:57:01 <thuna`>	You can define a setq-local version of my/setq-with-lots-of-stuff and use that instead
Feb 23 18:57:30 <thuna`>	You'd just need to replace the setq in its definition with setq-local

Feb 23 19:07:30 <hab25>	thuna`: thanks, that's a great idea which satisfies this case.  I'd love it if there were something like a syntax "`!" where I can write `!(setq ,my-var my-val) and it behaves like (eval `(setq ,my-var my-val)) and but without turning off the byte compiler linting like plain ` does
Feb 23 19:09:06 <hab25>	I'd use it to replace all my (eval `...) usages

Feb 23 19:16:19 <weary-traveler>	though that's debian free and not fsf free
Feb 23 19:21:53 <corwin>	I realize this is probably of interest only to me, but.. it's fascinating! Since I've been running the push and Windows build notices experiment it's the first time it has helped me notice something pretty unusual looking.

Feb 23 20:09:21 <horribleprogram>	can u guys spoonfeed me
Feb 23 20:09:28 <horribleprogram>	so
Feb 23 20:09:37 <horribleprogram>	paradigms of AI programming, it's Common Lisp
Feb 23 20:09:52 <horribleprogram>	but this particular code segment is compatible with ELisp
Feb 23 20:10:43 <horribleprogram>	(defvar *names* '((Robert E. Lee) ...))
Feb 23 20:10:44 <Odin-LAP>	bpalmer: Sounds simple enough.
Feb 23 20:10:57 <horribleprogram>	so the ... here seems to indicate there's more to this list of names
Feb 23 20:11:26 <horribleprogram>	taking that into account, to get "Lee" here, it says (caddar *names*)
Feb 23 20:12:25 <horribleprogram>	now, I have a basic grasp on CAR and CDR of cons cells
Feb 23 20:12:45 <horribleprogram>	first of all, how do I read this?
Feb 23 20:13:03 <horribleprogram>	C-h f says "returns the car of the cdr of the cdr of the car of X"
Feb 23 20:13:40 <Odin-LAP>	It's equivalent to (car (cdr (cdr (car *names*))))
Feb 23 20:13:51 <horribleprogram>	so i'm reading the 'caddar' from RTL?
Feb 23 20:14:01 <horribleprogram>	and when I see an a, it's CAR, when i see a d, it's CDR?
Feb 23 20:14:23 <Odin-LAP>	There is a #commonlisp on here, by the way. :)
Feb 23 20:14:26 <bpalmer>	yes. (let ((l '(1 2 3 4))) (caddr l)) => 3
Feb 23 20:14:31 <horribleprogram>	cddar would be the "cdr of the cdr of the car of X"
Feb 23 20:14:43 <horribleprogram>	kk perfect
Feb 23 20:14:57 <bkhl>	So you read it whichever way you want but you do both versions in the same direction. :-)
Feb 23 20:15:12 <technomancy>	horribleprogram: don't actually write programs this way tho, it's very silly
Feb 23 20:15:15 <horribleprogram>	ik
Feb 23 20:15:20 <horribleprogram>	the book even says "don't do this"
Feb 23 20:15:25 <Odin-LAP>	horribleprogram: https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_car_c.htm
Feb 23 20:15:26 <technomancy>	ah, that's good =)
Feb 23 20:15:34 <technomancy>	it's mostly for showing off or playing around
Feb 23 20:15:40 <horribleprogram>	Odin-LAP: perfect, this is nice
Feb 23 20:15:52 <horribleprogram>	but i don't understand how we got Lee there
Feb 23 20:16:15 <Inline>	no idea
Feb 23 20:16:17 <Odin-LAP>	These functions are mostly there because Common Lisp was trying to be compatible with existing implementations, some of which had a ton of these.
Feb 23 20:16:37 <horribleprogram>	working backwards, car of '((Robert E. Lee) (foo)) is '(Robert E. Lee)
Feb 23 20:16:41 <Odin-LAP>	horribleprogram: car gets you the first thing of  list, cdr moves you a step back.
Feb 23 20:16:56 <horribleprogram>	correct
Feb 23 20:17:09 <horribleprogram>	so the cdr of '(Robert E. Lee) would be the last 2 cons cells of that, the last 2 list elements
Feb 23 20:17:22 <Odin-LAP>	horribleprogram: So first you get the list that's the first element of the whole thing. Next you throw away the two elements on the front of that, then car gets you the first remaining thing.
Feb 23 20:17:25 <bkhl>	You can also think of them as head and tail.
Feb 23 20:17:35 <technomancy>	or first/rest
Feb 23 20:17:37 <horribleprogram>	OH
Feb 23 20:17:48 <Odin-LAP>	Or first and rest.
Feb 23 20:17:53 <technomancy>	"proper" vs "improper" complicates that tho
Feb 23 20:17:55 <horribleprogram>	the extra CAR is to actually extract it from the list
Feb 23 20:18:04 <Odin-LAP>	Bah, typed that, alt-tabbed out, and then back in to hit enter. :)
Feb 23 20:18:05 <horribleprogram>	yeah let's consider only proper lists right now
Feb 23 20:18:23 <horribleprogram>	This doesn't come intuitive to me lol
Feb 23 20:18:34 <horribleprogram>	like I can't visualize something like cdaaar
Feb 23 20:18:40 <Odin-LAP>	horribleprogram: Don't worry, it just plain isn't intuitive.
Feb 23 20:19:03 <Odin-LAP>	That's _why_ the abbreviations aren't really recommended for use.
Feb 23 20:19:38 <technomancy>	also not recommended: naming core functions after the implementation details of which registers you store your cells in
Feb 23 20:19:42 <bkhl>	If only there was some pattern matching to make it more visual. :-)
Feb 23 20:19:53 <thuna`>	cXd is write-only
Feb 23 20:20:05 <thuna`>	s/cXd/cXr/
Feb 23 20:20:15 <horribleprogram>	OMFG
Feb 23 20:20:17 <horribleprogram>	I'm doing that
Feb 23 20:20:59 <horribleprogram>	as you type the a's and d's, it highlights a more specific result
Feb 23 20:21:25 <Odin-LAP>	technomancy: Especially not recommended is writing a functioning temporary syntax for your programming language's syntax tree because you can't quite work out what you want the final syntax to look like.
Feb 23 20:22:03 <technomancy>	Odin-LAP: nah that ones fine =D
Feb 23 20:22:26 <horribleprogram>	do all thee accessors work for a simple nil?
Feb 23 20:22:33 <Odin-LAP>	technomancy: Well, it's how you end up with core functions mnemonically named for implementation details. :)
Feb 23 20:22:34 <horribleprogram>	as in, the car of nil is nil, and the cdr of nil is nil?
Feb 23 20:22:58 <horribleprogram>	so (cdadr nil) will be nil
Feb 23 20:23:15 <bkhl>	Yes.

Feb 23 20:23:29 <catern>	hmmm
Feb 23 20:23:33 <horribleprogram>	sweet ty
Feb 23 20:23:34 <technomancy>	some lisps will err out taking the car of an empty list IIRC
Feb 23 20:23:55 <catern>	is there a version of let which wraps the expression in a progn? so like you could do (let ((foo (forward-char) (point))) ....)
Feb 23 20:23:55 <bpalmer>	I do admire the citations.
Feb 23 20:23:58 <Odin-LAP>	horribleprogram: According to the CL standard, they should behave the same as the equivalent sequences of car and cdr, so yes.
Feb 23 20:24:06 <catern>	that would be so helpful
Feb 23 20:24:10 <horribleprogram>	sweet
Feb 23 20:24:22 <catern>	also, even more helpful would be if it just returned point at the end, actually
Feb 23 20:24:50 <technomancy>	I guess that might just be schemes; they're a lot more careful about not letting nonsense data leak
Feb 23 20:25:01 <bpalmer>	mwnaylor: use obarray-make , not make-vector
Feb 23 20:25:38 <bpalmer>	mwnaylor: but seems reasonable.
Feb 23 20:25:42 <mwnaylor>	bpalmer: I'll keep that in mind.
Feb 23 20:26:45 <Odin-LAP>	technomancy: I suspect there may be some older lisps as well, depending on what was easier to implement.
Feb 23 20:27:00 <technomancy>	ah true
Feb 23 20:27:06 <technomancy>	iirc it was pretty contentious when CL was standardized
Feb 23 20:27:09 <bpalmer>	catern: you'd need to macro that out, but I think the false positives will outweigh any advantage over just typing progn
Feb 23 20:27:56 *	Odin-LAP looks at the ISLISP spec.
Feb 23 20:27:56 <catern>	bpalmer: fair
Feb 23 20:28:03 <bpalmer>	Elisp decided to live in an almost car-safe society.
Feb 23 20:28:50 <mwnaylor>	Appears to be a technique I've been looking for. I want to be able to have elisp functions that will be used in org-mode spreadsheets. I don't need them lingering in global space once the buffer has been killed.
Feb 23 20:31:47 <Odin-LAP>	Hm, looks like ISLISP says both car and cdr error out on nil.
Feb 23 20:32:48 <mwnaylor>	I prefer car, cdr, and similar functions returning nil on the empty list rather than throwing an error.
Feb 23 20:34:26 <Odin-LAP>	It's pretty easy to create infinite loops that way, though.
Feb 23 20:34:30 <rpav>	mwnaylor: yeah it's an incredibly useful property
Feb 23 20:34:43 <rpav>	Odin-LAP: it's really not
Feb 23 20:34:48 <bpalmer>	I find the current elisp behavior very convenient. But I could just as easily use car-safe and cdr-safe for that; special casing nil is just that, a special case.
Feb 23 20:34:55 <rpav>	you loop until you get nil, then you're done
Feb 23 20:35:02 <Inline>	endp ?
Feb 23 20:35:48 <rpav>	the fact that nil is the _only_ false value also helps
Feb 23 20:36:48 <Odin-LAP>	rpav: Which means you're checking, at which point there's really no difference between checking for error or checking for nil.
Feb 23 20:36:58 <rpav>	Odin-LAP: not at all
Feb 23 20:37:20 <rpav>	it's always just `(when obj continue)`
Feb 23 20:37:44 <rpav>	there's no "well did i compare with the right thing, or did i forget and only check for one value"
Feb 23 20:38:55 <rpav>	if you use some ENDP, presumably you'd _also_ need a non-nil CDR, so then it's like.. well, CDR is nil but not ENDP? or what
Feb 23 20:39:57 <Odin-LAP>	We're not talking about cdr returning some sentinel value.
Feb 23 20:40:02 <rpav>	really a lot of programming would be a lot nicer with "default but valid values" but most programming languages don't make doing that very nice
Feb 23 20:40:18 <rpav>	Odin-LAP: i'm talking about how you _implement_ it
Feb 23 20:41:48 <rpav>	if you want to `(defun endp (cons) (null (cdr cons)))` you can already.. but it's also not going to make code nicer
Feb 23 20:42:00 <Odin-LAP>	rpav: Yes, in two implementation functions, not an endless variety of places in user code, so why would you forget to do the check?
Feb 23 20:42:40 <rpav>	(defun thing (list) (when list (do-part (car list)) (thing (cdr list))))
Feb 23 20:44:27 <Odin-LAP>	Surprisingly, tail-call optimisation is not a given in all Lisps...
Feb 23 20:44:52 <Inline>	scheme does it
Feb 23 20:44:55 <Inline>	cl not
Feb 23 20:45:04 <Inline>	no idea about elisp
Feb 23 20:45:04 <bpalmer>	CL does not mandate it.
Feb 23 20:45:08 <rpav>	mapcar (at least a very simple version) is even like what, (defun mapcar (f list) (when list (list* (f (car list)) (cdr list))))
Feb 23 20:46:22 <bpalmer>	rpav: also, (defun endp (obj) (cond ((consp obj) nil) ((null obj) t) (t (error "Neither fish nor fowl."))))
Feb 23 20:47:02 <Inline>	nor necessarily
Feb 23 20:47:05 <Inline>	lol
Feb 23 20:47:49 <bpalmer>	rpav: also, you're doing a fold operation
Feb 23 20:48:14 <rpav>	oh yeah need another mapcar at the end there
Feb 23 20:49:07 <rpav>	bpalmer: if you want to be sequence-agnostic, that's a bit different, but you could
Feb 23 20:49:42 <C0MMIE>	anyone experienced with the biboumi xmpp-orc gateway?
Feb 23 20:49:56 <C0MMIE>	anyone experienced with the biboumi xmpp-irc gateway?
Feb 23 20:50:21 <rpav>	oh, i was wondering what xmpp-orc was, and if it was fundamentally opposed by xmpp-elf
Feb 23 20:50:49 <Inline>	orcs and elfs
Feb 23 20:50:50 <Inline>	lol
Feb 23 20:51:00 <C0MMIE>	...
Feb 23 20:51:50 <rpav>	also disappointed it wasn't actually xmpp-org, which would probably have a higher chance of someone experienced here
Feb 23 20:52:16 <Inline>	is xmpp jabber ?
Feb 23 20:52:28 <rpav>	yeah
Feb 23 20:52:44 <Inline>	hmm, ok i have no idea about jabber, didn't even try to use it
Feb 23 20:53:26 <Inline>	i have never, not even once, used a jabber client
Feb 23 20:53:51 <Inline>	does it have something superior to the rest ?
Feb 23 20:54:21 <C0MMIE>	it has presence. it's like it's big selling point
Feb 23 20:54:34 <Inline>	what is that ?
Feb 23 20:54:35 <bkhl>	It's a distributed chat protocol which adds some features over IRC like a bit of hypertext, persistent logs, and what not.
Feb 23 20:54:47 <Inline>	ah
Feb 23 20:54:48 <rpav>	i can say that after seting up an ejabberd server and client and getting everything working ... i never used it, so i couldn't tell you ;)
Feb 23 20:54:50 <C0MMIE>	it's also stupidly simple messaging. it looks like XML, like rss
Feb 23 20:55:17 <bkhl>	It got a bit embraced and extinguished by Google.
Feb 23 20:55:19 <Inline>	encrypted ?
Feb 23 20:55:40 <C0MMIE>	most clients implement omemo on top of it
Feb 23 20:55:49 <Odin-LAP>	Not by default, it predates the end-to-end encryption craze, but there are protocols on top.
Feb 23 20:55:57 <bkhl>	Don't know if Facebook still use ejabberd for messenger.
Feb 23 20:56:11 <bkhl>	At some point at least, it was based on it.
Feb 23 20:56:16 <C0MMIE>	they might, but the don't federate
Feb 23 20:56:21 <Odin-LAP>	Jabber is MSN, AIM type of thing, rather than similar to IRC.
Feb 23 20:56:26 <Odin-LAP>	... any more. They used to.
Feb 23 20:56:31 <Odin-LAP>	Same as Google.
Feb 23 20:56:52 <lispmacs[work]>	Hi, in elisp, what is the most sensible way to temporarily override a global variable before calling a function?
Feb 23 20:57:02 <johnw>	`let` bind it
Feb 23 20:57:10 <Odin-LAP>	Or, well, no, sorry. No federation from either, but they allowed other clients to connect.
Feb 23 20:57:23 <mwnaylor>	I'm trying the code from the wiki in elpl. So far, the local defun is causing a void variable error.
Feb 23 20:57:32 <Inline>	right, and make sure you don't declare it special in that scope
Feb 23 20:57:44 <bkhl>	HCoop.net provides Jabber accounts if you're a member.
Feb 23 20:58:16 <lispmacs[work]>	johnw: the function (not defined by me) will internally use the let-bound version?
Feb 23 20:58:33 <lispmacs[work]>	we are dynamically bound by default?
Feb 23 20:58:35 <bpalmer>	lispmacs[work]: if the variable is defined with defvar, yes.
Feb 23 20:58:47 <johnw>	we are dynamically bound by default, unless the model explicit uses lexical binding
Feb 23 20:59:00 <bpalmer>	defvar variables are always dynamically bound by let.
Feb 23 20:59:02 <johnw>	does defvar always introduce a special variable?
Feb 23 20:59:06 <bpalmer>	yes.
Feb 23 20:59:07 <johnw>	ah, great
Feb 23 20:59:11 <mwnaylor>	Time to research interning and object-arrays to see if I can implement it as plain functions and not macros.
Feb 23 20:59:57 <Inline>	can you enforce lexical binding only for a certain scope and then leave it ?
Feb 23 21:00:05 <bpalmer>	I suppose there is an issue if (let ((x 3)) (defun foo () x))   is evaluated before (defvar x nil). Hmm.
Feb 23 21:00:32 <bpalmer>	Inline: nope. If you want that, you may want to use the lexical-let macro.
Feb 23 21:00:38 <Inline>	ah ok
Feb 23 21:01:19 <bpalmer>	From the elisp manual: "Every variable that has been defined with ‘defvar’, ‘defcustom’ or ‘defconst’ is a special variable (*note Defining Variables::).  All other variables are subject to lexical binding."
Feb 23 21:01:26 <johnw>	nice
Feb 23 21:04:31 <lispmacs[work]>	The let approach doesn't seem to be working in my case
Feb 23 21:04:37 <lispmacs[work]>	the variable in question is defined by defcustom
Feb 23 21:04:50 <lispmacs[work]>	I'm trying to temporarily overroad org-roam-graph-viewer
Feb 23 21:04:55 <lispmacs[work]>	override
Feb 23 21:05:01 <johnw>	defcustom should be a special variable
Feb 23 21:05:08 <lispmacs[work]>	before calling org-roam-graph
Feb 23 21:05:34 <lispmacs[work]>	I guess the question is does let really override special variables?
Feb 23 21:05:40 <lispmacs[work]>	or create a lexical context?
Feb 23 21:06:02 <johnw>	well, you can try the old-school way of setq into an old-var local variable, setq the global, and then restore it in the fallthrough of a condition-case
Feb 23 21:06:24 <rpav>	lispmacs[work]: there are things that can preclude dynamic bindings from being in effect when you want
Feb 23 21:06:32 <bpalmer>	lispmacs[work]: you'll have to show some code, I suspect.
Feb 23 21:06:35 <rpav>	^^
Feb 23 21:06:35 <Odin-LAP>	It should establish a dynamic binding, shouldn't it?
Feb 23 21:06:41 <lispmacs[work]>	johnw: is there some convenient push function for that?
Feb 23 21:06:50 <johnw>	not that I'm aware of, since `let` is usually the right answer
Feb 23 21:07:19 <bpalmer>	the biggest issue that does *not* work with simple lets is any non-synchronous function.
Feb 23 21:07:20 <rpav>	e.g. if you do something like (let ((dynamic-binding ..)) (set-process-handler #'function ..)) or whatever, it won't be in effect when the process handler is called
Feb 23 21:07:30 <lispmacs[work]>	https://bpa.st/YGN2K
Feb 23 21:07:31 <rpav>	yeah exactly
Feb 23 21:07:35 <bpalmer>	for example, anything using url-retrieve is a real pain
Feb 23 21:07:55 <rpav>	i guess the question is wtf does org-graph-roam do
Feb 23 21:08:32 <lispmacs[work]>	rpav: it opens an SVG file in the viewer specified by org-roam-graph-viewer
Feb 23 21:09:22 <lispmacs[work]>	org-roam-graph, to be precise
Feb 23 21:09:41 <lispmacs[work]>	correcting your typo
Feb 23 21:09:42 <rpav>	it would, yes, help a lot if i got the symbol right heh
Feb 23 21:09:53 <bpalmer>	what file is org-roam-graph defined in?
Feb 23 21:09:55 <rpav>	i'm like "why is nothing finding this?!"
Feb 23 21:10:02 *	bpalmer bemoans github's lack of logged out search
Feb 23 21:10:13 <lispmacs[work]>	org-roam-graph.el
Feb 23 21:10:21 <bpalmer>	oh, not part of org-roam itself
Feb 23 21:10:40 <lispmacs[work]>	it is a file in the same package
Feb 23 21:10:59 <lispmacs[work]>	line 137 in my version
Feb 23 21:11:05 <rpav>	finding the source is annoyingly difficult
Feb 23 21:11:18 <bpalmer>	ah, in a subdir: https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/blob/main/extensions/org-roam-graph.el
Feb 23 21:11:45 <lispmacs[work]>	C-h f org-roam-graph brings it up quickly for me
Feb 23 21:12:10 <rpav>	lispmacs[work]: well without installing it
Feb 23 21:12:25 <lispmacs[work]>	ah
Feb 23 21:12:30 <bpalmer>	lispmacs[work]: yes, this is an asynchronous function.
Feb 23 21:12:50 <bpalmer>	lispmacs[work]: it calls a process to build the graph and then calls the browser via a callback in the process sentinel
Feb 23 21:13:05 <lispmacs[work]>	dasterdly evil
Feb 23 21:14:34 <bpalmer>	lispmacs[work]: one way to deal with this is to advise org-roam-graph--build to wrap its callback function in a new function that has the dynamic binding at work
Feb 23 21:14:49 <bpalmer>	this is, of course, mildly intrusive on an internal function.
Feb 23 21:15:11 <lispmacs[work]>	um, it sounds easier to just save and restore the old value
Feb 23 21:15:27 <bpalmer>	yes, but you still have to figure out when to restore the old value. Because, synchronicity
Feb 23 21:15:34 <lispmacs[work]>	ah
Feb 23 21:15:47 <lispmacs[work]>	crickeys
Feb 23 21:16:08 <bpalmer>	oh, I guess you can put the restoration in the hook org-roam-graph-generation-hook, which runs after the callback
Feb 23 21:16:12 <bpalmer>	see line 176
Feb 23 21:16:29 <bpalmer>	put a function on the hook which restores the browser variable and removes itself from the hook
Feb 23 21:17:08 <bpalmer>	you'll just have to be careful in the case that you call org-roam-graph multiple times while the graph is being built.
Feb 23 21:17:12 <lispmacs[work]>	so, erm, how exactly do I save the value of a variable in a local variable without making the old variable a reference to the new variable
Feb 23 21:17:23 <lispmacs[work]>	or, the new variable a reference to the old variable, I meant
Feb 23 21:17:57 <bpalmer>	(let ((x y)) <-- x is a local/lexical variable that has the same value as y. But changing y will not change x
Feb 23 21:18:08 <lispmacs[work]>	okay, thanks
Feb 23 21:18:15 <bpalmer>	(mutating y might. fun of mutability)

Feb 23 21:29:49 *	Topic for #emacs set by e1f!~user@user/e1f (Wed Feb 14 17:01:13 2024)
Feb 23 21:30:24 <mwnaylor>	Under the hood, `obarray-make' calls `make-vector'.
Feb 23 21:31:26 <JohnGalt>	it stores bindings
Feb 23 21:31:38 <JohnGalt>	I mean data
Feb 23 21:32:06 <JohnGalt>	its pretty much a dictionary
Feb 23 21:32:30 <thuna`>	Does anyone know/remember the name of a/the alternate diff program that interfaced nicely with magit?
Feb 23 21:33:38 <JohnGalt>	emacs has a great diff mode
Feb 23 21:33:51 <JohnGalt>	you can cherry pick and delete hunks
Feb 23 21:34:26 <kendell>	I'm a very new person to emacs and emacspeak and I'm having trouble getting emacspeak 53 to bite compile on my laptop. My wife's laptop bite compiles it with no issues, same version and everything. Is there any way I can troubleshoot the problem so I can use emacspeak? I really am impressed with both it and emacs
Feb 23 21:34:28 <thuna`>	I just need a bit smarter highlighting.  Indenting the block in elisp doesn't really count as a "change"
Feb 23 21:35:49 <kendell>	ubuntu 24.04 noble numbat, system fully upgraded, emacs 29
Feb 23 21:36:14 <JohnGalt>	thuna`: if the file changes its a change, no diff program is going to act differently or weed out whitespace changes for you
Feb 23 21:36:18 <JohnGalt>	none that I know of
Feb 23 21:37:16 <thuna`>	JohnGalt: The one I saw didn't get rid of the changes but highlighted "important" changes differently
Feb 23 21:37:26 <kendell>	I'm looking for help from an emacs expert who can help me troubleshoot why emacspeak, which runs on top of emacs, won't bite compile on my laptop, a vizio, but will on mellisa's, which is a toshiba. Hers is running ubuntu 22.04 rather than 24.04
Feb 23 21:38:17 <malc>	i'm witnessing significant screen corruption issues with emacs/gtk on asahi linux. the wm is kwin, the ws is wayland. was wondering if there was some kind of compatibility option somewhere
Feb 23 21:38:32 <thuna`>	kendell: What do you mean by "it doesn't compile"?  Do you have warnings/errors?
Feb 23 21:38:45 <younder>	elisp doesn't use (Language Server Protocol) LSP. It doesn't need it. Lisp has always had this level of introspection. Thus the highlighting should be plenty smart. It is not merely based on regeps but on the the lisp syntax of the document.
Feb 23 21:39:19 <kendell>	no errors displayed, just a temporary log file I can't seem to get to to copy and paste. Just says bite compiling, 0.6 min before saying that the emacspeak install process exited with code 1, standard apt something went wrong message
Feb 23 21:40:36 <kendell>	if I could find that log file I could probably pastebin it and someone could pinpoint the problem. It's not in /var/log though
Feb 23 21:40:45 <thuna`>	kendell: It's a bit difficult to help without the log file, especially since I'm not on ubuntu.  Maybe someone here can try install it as well?
Feb 23 21:40:59 <thuna`>	s/someone here/someone here with ubuntu/
Feb 23 21:41:22 <kendell>	that would be great, thanks. Just out of curiosity, where is that log file stored? I'll find it and pastebin it
Feb 23 21:42:09 <jvml>	hello once again #emacs denizens
Feb 23 21:43:15 <younder>	thuna' You should look in the CUSTOMIZE section to change the highlighting.
Feb 23 21:43:25 <jvml>	just had a bunch of caffeine which was pretty nice
Feb 23 21:43:49 <kendell>	caffeine is always really nice. About to indulge in some myself while I troubleshoot emacspeak
Feb 23 21:44:10 <jvml>	what's your ideal delivery mechanism?
Feb 23 21:44:34 <kendell>	soda, coffee, tea, anything will work. And of course lets not forget energy drinks
Feb 23 21:44:36 <jvml>	i alternate between tea (usually either sencha or lapsang souchong depending on how much caffeine i'd like) and energy drinks
Feb 23 21:44:51 <jvml>	i don't really use soda as a delivery mechanism but i am partial to the taste of mountain dew baja blast...
Feb 23 21:45:15 <jvml>	which is more or less an energy drink for people who are scared of energy drinks LOL
Feb 23 21:45:40 <kendell>	we need an open source energy drink. Or rather, an open recipe energy drink.
Feb 23 21:45:47 <kendell>	and an open recipe coke, etc
Feb 23 21:46:25 <jvml>	would love to have an open source energy drink based on tea...or maybe i'm just thinking of tea
Feb 23 21:46:45 <grym>	i think that's just tea
Feb 23 21:46:50 <Odin-LAP>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCola_(drink)
Feb 23 21:46:58 <kendell>	I hate proprietary licenses, can't stand them. It's ours, you can't touch it. Though you can use it, with these conditions. No thanks
Feb 23 21:47:02 <jvml>	and i've heard of OpenCola before because i used to be really autistic about making soda
Feb 23 21:47:08 <jvml>	i never made OpenCola in particular tho
Feb 23 21:47:40 <JohnGalt>	I like going to the coffee shop, it gets me out of the house for a while
Feb 23 21:47:41 <jvml>	cola is delicious in general
Feb 23 21:47:54 <jvml>	citrus colas in particular (european Pepsi Lemon is amazing)
Feb 23 21:47:54 <JohnGalt>	yeah, I OD'd on diet coke
Feb 23 21:47:55 <younder>	autistic about making SODA? How did you manage that?
Feb 23 21:48:04 <JohnGalt>	had to quit Diet Coke
Feb 23 21:48:05 <kendell>	amen to both the last couple of posts. Coffee shops for the win, and I love cola
Feb 23 21:48:27 <jvml>	younder: i would generally make simple syrups on the stovetop and add club soda to taste, it was a very simple process but i tried lots of different recipes with it
Feb 23 21:48:36 <thuna`>	kendell: You don't actually need to byte-compile the package.  If you can't disable it when installing the shipped emacspeak maybe you can try to install it from the source?
Feb 23 21:49:16 <jvml>	sometimes i still make simple syrups, one time i prepared a cinnamon-orange drink for a date and it was a hit
Feb 23 21:49:25 <kendell>	building emacspeak from source, now there's an idea
Feb 23 21:49:34 <jvml>	just water, orange juice, orange zest, and a bit of cinnamon
Feb 23 21:49:36 <jvml>	and sugar.
Feb 23 21:50:13 <jvml>	lotta sugar
Feb 23 21:50:22 <grym>	jvml: sub bourbon for water and sure
Feb 23 21:50:31 <jvml>	LOL
Feb 23 21:50:51 <jvml>	i'm sure it would've been fantastic as a cocktail
Feb 23 21:51:16 <kendell>	I looked at the windows license the other day. I couldn't believe my wife agreed to that garbage.
Feb 23 21:51:38 <kendell>	not windows itself, the license. Full of you can't do this, you can't do that
Feb 23 21:52:05 <jvml>	only thing keeping me on windows is all my multimedia work. ableton and photoshop mostly
Feb 23 21:52:13 <jvml>	if ableton had a linux port i would get right outta here
Feb 23 21:52:34 <rpav>	yeah unfortunately windows still dominates for promedia ;/
Feb 23 21:53:07 <jvml>	really hope that ableton will have an official linux port at some point because i won't lie i hate using wine
Feb 23 21:53:18 <rpav>	and games, though that's weakening _slightly_
Feb 23 21:53:38 <jvml>	wine (drink) is great, but wine (software) requires so much configuration for multimedia that i simply don't have the time or will for
Feb 23 21:53:39 <kendell>	I use wine, or try to. Can't seem to get sound to work, though it's supposed to
Feb 23 21:54:08 <JohnGalt>	I use photoshop without a problem
Feb 23 21:54:28 <rpav>	photoshop is a collection of problems
Feb 23 21:54:32 <JohnGalt>	I just updated it today
Feb 23 21:54:39 <jvml>	i'm still on photoshop 2020
Feb 23 21:54:40 <JohnGalt>	rpav: clearly you havent seen gimp
Feb 23 21:54:50 <kendell>	oh I love love gimp
Feb 23 21:54:52 <JohnGalt>	its the shitiest program almost ever
Feb 23 21:54:57 <rpav>	JohnGalt: gimp is not the only or the primary alternative
Feb 23 21:55:00 <jvml>	i have this one friend who keeps telling me to switch to gimp or hinting at it but i have so many niche photoshop features that i rely on
Feb 23 21:55:13 <grym>	rpav: inkscape, obvi
Feb 23 21:55:15 <JohnGalt>	yeah, like object selection that works
Feb 23 21:55:17 <jvml>	impossible to imagine editing any other way
Feb 23 21:55:17 <corwin>	photoshop and friends are a key reason I am running Windows although I seem to update these tools two three times for each time I run one of them.
Feb 23 21:55:28 <jvml>	although i AM actually good at editing in scribus, but that's all vector
Feb 23 21:55:31 <rpav>	it does like 1 thing pretty well which is box selection and moving, and i actually find that useful, but there are a number of other things that are PS alternativees
Feb 23 21:55:34 <rpav>	grym: ;)
Feb 23 21:55:42 <rpav>	grym: they actually had a big update recently didn't they?
Feb 23 21:55:44 <JohnGalt>	illustrator is nice, acrobat is nice
Feb 23 21:55:48 <grym>	rpav: i think so, yes
Feb 23 21:55:57 <jvml>	illustrator is peak vector design software imo
Feb 23 21:56:13 <rpav>	bah illustrator is crap
Feb 23 21:56:22 <rpav>	unless you invest tons into addons
Feb 23 21:56:42 <grym>	all of it makes my head hurt
Feb 23 21:56:46 <rpav>	but vanilla, sheesh
Feb 23 21:56:54 <jvml>	even though it's great illustrator still made my head hurt when i used it frequently
Feb 23 21:56:57 <kendell>	free software only for me thanks. I will use windows, but only as a last resort and usually find myself wishing I didn't have to
Feb 23 21:57:17 <rpav>	adobe UI is like decades of agglomerated features
Feb 23 21:57:46 <JohnGalt>	windows is not free
Feb 23 21:57:51 <JohnGalt>	I know , I paid for it
Feb 23 21:57:57 <rpav>	same ;/
Feb 23 21:58:04 <jvml>	the thing about vector editing in adobe software is that it's really hard to predict what behavior is going to come out of whatever you're doing. like you have to click a very certain way to get consistent results, or you have to have something or another enabled to make the thing you want to do happen
Feb 23 21:58:24 <jvml>	that annoys me
Feb 23 21:58:28 <rpav>	jvml: i despise how its alignment works (if it could be considered such)
Feb 23 21:58:44 <rpav>	it doesn't have procedural brushes etc
Feb 23 21:58:51 <rpav>	again vanilla, but
Feb 23 21:58:53 <jvml>	i think alignment in ps is perfectly fine, i love everything about photoshop, but it confuses me to no end in illustrator
Feb 23 21:59:18 <jvml>	which is why i haven't used illustrator in about three years.
Feb 23 22:00:28 <rpav>	i have a pretty good experience with clip studio for the creation kind of stuff and affinity for photo stuff, though i don't do it a ton
Feb 23 22:00:41 <jvml>	clip studio is lovely i've heard
Feb 23 22:00:48 <rpav>	though some pros i've heard of seem to like affinity as well
Feb 23 22:01:09 <jvml>	but my work is in avant-digital collage or whatever so csp never really had any "draw" for me
Feb 23 22:01:09 <rpav>	heard from that is
Feb 23 22:01:21 <jvml>	really glad that CSP's maintainers have hitherto kept it single-purchase
Feb 23 22:01:23 <rpav>	yeah clip isn't super general
Feb 23 22:01:35 <corwin>	rpav: at least as bad CreativeStudio in the "tons on add-ons to get work done" respect is Avid ProTools.  Hundreds every year or two to re-up support, meaning "keep working with latest hardware and OS" on my "perpetually licensed" edition, and then you start buying plugins (of which one ends up with several hundred)
Feb 23 22:01:49 <jvml>	oh god pro tools is horrible
Feb 23 22:01:56 <rpav>	corwin: yeah i don't really understand the draw there either .. or autodesk stuff
Feb 23 22:02:33 <jvml>	their AAX plugin format that only works in licensed versions of pro tools and requires loads of activation/verification sucks
Feb 23 22:02:47 <mwnaylor>	technomancy: Are you the one who was commenting on the clojure `do' form and comparing it to lisp `progn'?
Feb 23 22:03:12 <rpav>	maya LT which costs roughly the same as Houdini Indie and is shit; maya full has some more stuff but is the same kind of "layers of crap"
Feb 23 22:03:16 <corwin>	I have at least two differen iLoks that I need to make it work with different hardware.  I need to transfer plugins between them sometimes.
Feb 23 22:03:30 <mwnaylor>	The discussion had to do with side effects within the form.
Feb 23 22:03:35 <rpav>	houdini is f'n amazing, but i'm a bit biased as it's sortof "3d modeler for programmers"
Feb 23 22:03:40 <jvml>	ilok is the devil
Feb 23 22:04:19 <JohnGalt>	to do the kind of 3d modelling they do for a AAA title takes to much work
Feb 23 22:05:30 <JohnGalt>	wow, my m1 is far slower than this m3
Feb 23 22:05:36 <JohnGalt>	and 39 gig isnt bad
Feb 23 22:05:50 <JohnGalt>	the m3 is a huge leap forward
Feb 23 22:05:51 <jvml>	ram?
Feb 23 22:05:52 <fsbot>	RAM is short for Random Access Memory
Feb 23 22:05:56 <jvml>	LOL
Feb 23 22:06:01 <JohnGalt>	yeah RAM
Feb 23 22:06:01 <jvml>	didn't know that was a bot here
Feb 23 22:06:07 <jvml>	i know what RAM is silly :/
Feb 23 22:06:23 <JohnGalt>	I only got 1tb for storage since I wont have large archives
Feb 23 22:06:36 <jvml>	i have 2tb on this laptop and then two external drives with the same capacity
Feb 23 22:06:38 <rpav>	JohnGalt: eh kinda .. a lot of stuff is like megascan style assets now and with like nanite etc there's a lot less post work that needs done
Feb 23 22:06:44 <jvml>	lotta audio stuff i have to keep backed up...
Feb 23 22:07:13 <rpav>	and if you have the $$ you can do a lot of character outfit work in Marvelous
Feb 23 22:07:19 <JohnGalt>	I have other servers for that
Feb 23 22:07:24 <JohnGalt>	I have a 16 gig NAS
Feb 23 22:07:30 <jvml>	very nice!
Feb 23 22:07:33 <JohnGalt>	16 tb NAS
Feb 23 22:07:35 <rpav>	16 gig or T?
Feb 23 22:07:38 <rpav>	ok hehe
Feb 23 22:07:50 <gig>	nice
Feb 23 22:07:54 <jvml>	i want to get something more permanent than the drives i have now eventually
Feb 23 22:07:59 <JohnGalt>	RAID5
Feb 23 22:08:03 <rpav>	JohnGalt: did you build it or just use off the shelf hw?
Feb 23 22:08:08 <JohnGalt>	have spare drives ready to go
Feb 23 22:08:14 <JohnGalt>	rpav: bought it
Feb 23 22:08:19 <JohnGalt>	it was only 1k or so
Feb 23 22:08:19 <rpav>	ah
Feb 23 22:08:31 <komikat>	what setup do you guys use for irc
Feb 23 22:08:33 <JohnGalt>	it was already setup for time machine
Feb 23 22:08:41 <rpav>	i kinda want a low-powered pi-driven NAS if that's viable, then a more power-sucking threadripper server for like big compute/compile stuff
Feb 23 22:08:49 <komikat>	i've been trying to setup znc with erc
Feb 23 22:08:56 <rpav>	znc -> erc
Feb 23 22:09:02 <JohnGalt>	rpav: pi corrupt easy
Feb 23 22:09:05 <komikat>	jinx
Feb 23 22:09:13 <rpav>	JohnGalt: corrupt?
Feb 23 22:09:33 <JohnGalt>	they just bit flip
Feb 23 22:09:34 <komikat>	rpav: do you use znc.el?
Feb 23 22:09:41 <jvml>	komikat: just erc
Feb 23 22:09:43 <rpav>	komikat: it's not hard, hell i actually use erc -> domain socket <- ssh tunnel -> znc
Feb 23 22:09:44 <JohnGalt>	I used to have six of them
Feb 23 22:09:53 <rpav>	komikat: yeah i think so, i just M-x znc-all
Feb 23 22:09:57 <JohnGalt>	I was going to build a cluster with ansible but they are shit
Feb 23 22:10:18 <rpav>	znc i don't even bother to do over SSL, and only have it attach locally on the virt
Feb 23 22:10:30 <rpav>	then i only ever talk to it over ssh tunnel
Feb 23 22:10:54 <komikat>	rpav: when I use znc.el, it asks me to put my pass again even though it already is in my init.el
Feb 23 22:10:56 <rpav>	JohnGalt: lame.. gotta find smething lower powered though
Feb 23 22:10:57 <komikat>	not sure whats up
Feb 23 22:11:14 <komikat>	does the pass have to be in the username/server:pass format?
Feb 23 22:11:19 <JohnGalt>	I need to get a dedicated 15 amp curcuit foro the office
Feb 23 22:11:24 <rpav>	komikat: i just have M-x customize-group znc and a server filled out
Feb 23 22:11:34 <JohnGalt>	im on a 15 amp shared by three roooms
Feb 23 22:12:01 <rpav>	username is `login/server`, network slug is 'server', and pw is pw
Feb 23 22:12:07 <JohnGalt>	luckily the wife doesnt use much power in her tv room
Feb 23 22:12:26 <rpav>	15 isn't bad, shouldn't have to worry with just a bit of computer gear
Feb 23 22:12:35 <technomancy>	mwnaylor: probably. as far as I can tell they're exactly the same thing
Feb 23 22:12:38 <technomancy>	also scheme `begin'
Feb 23 22:12:38 <rpav>	er i think
Feb 23 22:12:55 <JohnGalt>	4 servers , 3 mac laptops, and a framework, plus audio, network gear
Feb 23 22:13:00 <rpav>	maybe i'm thinking of 40.. i dunno, it's late on friday x.x
Feb 23 22:13:04 <rpav>	nice
Feb 23 22:13:20 <rpav>	we just have 2 game PCs/monitors/TV
Feb 23 22:13:22 <JohnGalt>	if I dont sequence it when the power comes back on it trips the breaker
Feb 23 22:13:36 <JohnGalt>	plus I was running a AC unit for a while
Feb 23 22:14:14 <technomancy>	mwnaylor: and `prog1' is a little bit like `doto' but without the threadiness
Feb 23 22:16:26 <mwnaylor>	technomancy: I can appreciate the side effect bit more in elisp. When operating on values/structures, I tend to write in a functional & immutable mode. BUT, the side effects and proper sequencing makes sense when dealing w/ mutable structures like buffers.
Feb 23 22:16:56 <JohnGalt>	also when doing databases and other storage stuff
Feb 23 22:18:00 <technomancy>	it's difficult to keep things immutable in elisp, especially when interacting with 3rd-party code, but yeah
Feb 23 22:19:01 <mwnaylor>	I guess that in the land of emacs, a file is simply a snapshot of a buffer in a given instant of time.
Feb 23 22:19:50 <mwnaylor>	The only database thing I do from emacs is poke around in an sqlite file.
Feb 23 22:20:35 <JohnGalt>	I use mostly python
Feb 23 22:20:51 <JohnGalt>	for analytic queries I use TablePlus
Feb 23 22:21:15 <mwnaylor>	Pyhon in general or python for database?
Feb 23 22:21:21 <JohnGalt>	both
Feb 23 22:21:29 <JohnGalt>	mostly shell and python
Feb 23 22:21:43 <JohnGalt>	sometimes other stuff if its a better fit
Feb 23 22:22:37 <JohnGalt>	If I really need performance I can do java
Feb 23 22:22:52 <mwnaylor>	It's been a long time since I used python to interact with a database. I do remember that the batteries included libraries made it easier.
Feb 23 22:23:09 <JohnGalt>	sqlalchemy is really good
Feb 23 22:23:26 <JohnGalt>	I heard the django library is supposed to be good
Feb 23 22:24:18 <bkhl>	I did some a bit more low level stuff with Python DB-API recently, and it's pretty nice too.
Feb 23 22:24:53 <mwnaylor>	django mainly intended for web development, iirc. Guess one could just use the database related components for any purpose.
Feb 23 22:25:35 <JohnGalt>	SqlAlchemy has a good ORM now, not just a sql wrapper
Feb 23 22:26:11 <komikat>	ended up just using erc
Feb 23 22:26:20 <JohnGalt>	I like erc
Feb 23 22:26:24 <JohnGalt>	I tried a few
Feb 23 22:26:30 <technomancy>	it's quite good
Feb 23 22:26:33 <komikat>	yeah
Feb 23 22:26:39 <kickingvegas>	mwnaylor, JohnGalt : what kind of DB stuff are you trying to do (arguably from Emacs?)
Feb 23 22:26:43 <komikat>	i'm trying to set up a znc <> erc thing
Feb 23 22:26:58 <JohnGalt>	just a database right now with technical data
Feb 23 22:27:10 <komikat>	need to figure out how to query nickserv
Feb 23 22:27:31 <JohnGalt>	Im doing sqlite right now, but I can switch to pg quickly since Im using sqlalchemy
Feb 23 22:27:40 <JohnGalt>	if I scale up to teams that will be nice
Feb 23 22:27:42 <Inline>	 /msg nickserv help
Feb 23 22:28:04 <Inline>	or the equivalent command in erc
Feb 23 22:28:18 <technomancy>	you can /query nickserv
Feb 23 22:28:25 <JohnGalt>	plus I have a metaclass library that does JSON in conjunction with sqlalchemy so with little effort I can insert/query/and export to JSON
Feb 23 22:28:33 <mwnaylor>	kickingvegas: occasionally I'll poke around in the sqlite3 files maintained by browsers. Maybe work with a personal sqlite3 file.
Feb 23 22:28:39 <komikat>	Inline: gotcha
Feb 23 22:28:48 <komikat>	i wonder if i can just set this up in my init.el
Feb 23 22:29:03 <Inline>	yes you can
Feb 23 22:29:04 <komikat>	to connect to the znc server and log into nickserv at init
Feb 23 22:29:16 <komikat>	hmm
Feb 23 22:29:17 <Inline>	i had once a config, giant one with it's own erc section.....
Feb 23 22:29:44 <komikat>	nice
Feb 23 22:29:45 <Inline>	from connecting the server to autojoining channels etc... you can do lots
Feb 23 22:29:53 <kickingvegas>	mwnaylor: fwiw you can query sqlite3 files from Org
Feb 23 22:30:54 <mwnaylor>	kickingvegas: did not know that. Do you have links on how to do that?
Feb 23 22:31:30 <kickingvegas>	also, if you have a small dataset, you can put that in an Org table and run sql queries on it http://yummymelon.com/devnull/running-sql-queries-on-org-tables.html
Feb 23 22:31:58 <random-jellyfish>	how do I start slime in a bottom window instead of a right side window?

Feb 23 22:35:46 <mwnaylor>	kickingvegas: bookmarked in emacs and my gui browser.
Feb 23 22:38:57 <bremner>	all names are foreign names where I live
Feb 23 22:39:15 <bremner>	(to a first approximation)
Feb 23 22:40:41 <JohnGalt>	my mispronunciation of names was legendary in the offices I worked in

Feb 23 22:45:25 <kickingvegas>	mwnaylor: all good - hope you find them useful!
Feb 23 22:45:39 <komikat>	apologies
Feb 23 22:49:18 <mwnaylor>	kickingvegas: I'm getting into org-mode spreadsheets and using code-blocks to create custom elisp functions for those spreadsheets. Too often, spreadsheets have been used as a poor man's database, so who knows?
Feb 23 22:51:45 <kickingvegas>	mwnaylor: exactly my motivation to figure out how to do SQL queries on org tables. Who needs pivot tables when you have group by?
Feb 23 22:56:10 <mwnaylor>	kickingvegas: many of the built in capabilities of lisp dialects can be used to mimic sql. For example, `-filter' or `cl-remove-if-not' are much like a where clause.
Feb 23 22:57:21 <mwnaylor>	`-filter' is part of the dash package.
Feb 23 23:03:30 <mwnaylor>	group-by is sure a powerful concept that it is one of the core functions in clojure.
Feb 23 23:10:34 <kickingvegas>	mwnaylor: TIL/good to know. That said, my SQL is better than my Lisp 😏
Feb 23 23:17:42 <mwnaylor>	Is there a package that provides a group-by function to elisp? In clojure, the signature is (group-by f coll). It walks through the collection, applying the predicate to each member. It creates a dictionary/hash-map. The function uses the function results as keys and matching items as the values.
Feb 23 23:17:49 <wasamasa>	have you checked seq?
Feb 23 23:18:05 <mwnaylor>	(group-by odd? [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]) => {true [1 3 5 7 9], false [2 4 6 8 10]}
Feb 23 23:19:53 <thuna`>	What's the least redundant way to write this? https://0x0.st/H5wv.txt  I basically have two (or more) "paths" to compute a fixed set of variables and a single body that will use the result of those variables without caring how they were obtained.
Feb 23 23:20:06 <mwnaylor>	wasamasa wins the prize. (seq-group-by FUNCTION SEQUENCE) And I have that package installed!!
Feb 23 23:20:40 <thuna`>	seq.el's builtin
Feb 23 23:22:53 <thuna`>	I should note about my question: all "paths" are each a single when-let.  The code I pasted is the real code I am asking this for, so any specific suggestions that apply only to that would work as well.
Feb 23 23:24:15 <thuna`>	(Bonus points if you can make it a single-ish if-let :P)
Feb 23 23:25:44 <thuna`>	I wrote it as a pcase-let but it was just not readable at all.
Feb 23 23:25:46 <technomancy>	if-let is just anemic pattern matching
Feb 23 23:28:07 <thuna`>	Alright, I can get to if-let by wrapping (if update...) with (or (if update...) (prog1 nil else...))
Feb 23 23:28:18 <mwnaylor>	I've installed so many packages that I don't recognize which ones are built-in and which have been installed.
Feb 23 23:28:42 <bpalmer>	given the choice between if-let and pcase-let, I know the readable one I'm going for.
Feb 23 23:28:50 <thuna`>	If it's installed it's been built in
Feb 23 23:28:55 <bpalmer>	oops, did I give my choice away?
Feb 23 23:29:15 <JohnGalt>	man irish coffee is so good for coding!
Feb 23 23:29:16 <bpalmer>	but I still will probably use let/if , because why use one word when two words do?
Feb 23 23:29:48 <thuna`>	if/when/while-let is very convenient
Feb 23 23:29:48 <technomancy>	wait what's pcase-let?
Feb 23 23:30:04 <technomancy>	doesn't pcase already do binding? why would you need to add moar let
Feb 23 23:30:24 <technomancy>	wait
Feb 23 23:30:25 <technomancy>	lol
Feb 23 23:30:37 <technomancy>	pcase-let doesn't actually do any case at all?
Feb 23 23:30:57 <thuna`>	technomancy: pcase-like destructuring for bindings.  You can have multiple EXPs, which I guess is what it offers over pcase
Feb 23 23:31:06 <mwnaylor>	OH!!! Got to add (require 'seq) to my .emacs.
Feb 23 23:31:22 <bpalmer>	well, it also unconditionally evaluates the body, unlike using pcase
Feb 23 23:31:30 <technomancy>	please please please think thru things before picking names ಠ_ಠ
Feb 23 23:31:49 <bpalmer>	you're more likely to use pcase-let when you would otherwise do destructuring-bind, except, again, readability
Feb 23 23:31:51 <thuna`>	When the package name is pcase there's not much you can do
Feb 23 23:32:06 <technomancy>	it's a great idea but what a terrible name =(
Feb 23 23:32:26 <technomancy>	thuna`: pcase isn't a package
Feb 23 23:32:40 <thuna`>	I consider it one
Feb 23 23:33:13 <bpalmer>	(destructuring-bind (a b) '(1 2) ( + a b)) =>   3  ; (pcase-let ((`(,a ,b) '(1 2))) (+ a b)) => 3
Feb 23 23:34:04 <mwnaylor>	Wow. Now that I know about seq, maybe I can do w/o dash.
Feb 23 23:34:19 <technomancy>	yeah I thought seq.el was supposed to be a dash replacement
Feb 23 23:35:17 <thuna`>	seq.el is cl-seq replacement AFAIK
Feb 23 23:35:34 <technomancy>	bpalmer: it's really weird to see backtick and commas used together like that
Feb 23 23:35:47 <technomancy>	it makes it look like it should be a no-op; like the backtick and the comma should cancel each other out
Feb 23 23:38:12 <mwnaylor>	Great. Tired of seeing dash warnings. Hopefully package maintainers are weeding those out.
Feb 23 23:42:11 <mwnaylor>	Not for today, but will have to comment out my (require 'dash) expression and see what breaks. Can't control the third party packages, but at least I can fix my own extensions.

Hence there must be no arbitrariness in what is said. This matters above everything.

Feb 23 23:47:59 <bpalmer>	mwnaylor: see, the people who named the character that got their point across, I think.
Feb 23 23:48:15 <bpalmer>	Thus, the name was suitably rectified.
Feb 23 23:51:42 <mwnaylor>	bpalmer: A friend of my wife and me met a college aged guy who gave his cat that name. BTW, I read most of the Ian Fleming novels that were the basis for the movies. PG was in the original work.
Feb 23 23:52:04 <bpalmer>	I have only read bits of one of the early Bond novels

Feb 23 23:53:49 <JohnGalt>	they are definitely collector quality
Feb 23 23:55:11 <JohnGalt>	they dont have whacky names as much in the books
Feb 23 23:55:31 <JohnGalt>	Austin powers was pretty good for names too
Feb 23 23:56:01 <bpalmer>	lispmacs[work]: it sounds like there might be an error occuring before thos eare evaluated. Could you insert a message like (message "made it after the key binding things") and check to see if you can see that when the keys don't work?
Feb 23 23:56:16 <mwnaylor>	More realistic. Bond would have required about 6 months rehab after each mission.
Feb 23 23:56:54 <bpalmer>	that's what comes of mixing alcoholism and spycraft.
Feb 23 23:57:47 <JohnGalt>	archer does that better
Feb 23 23:57:56 <JohnGalt>	archer is a role model for me
Feb 23 23:57:57 <lispmacs[work]>	bpalmer: okay
Feb 23 23:58:02 <JohnGalt>	except the baby part
Feb 24 00:01:05 <lispmacs[work]>	bpalmer: the message is showing up - init.el execution is making it past the bindings without any errors reported
Feb 24 00:01:21 <thuna`>	lispmacs[work]: It could also be that a minor mode is overriding them
Feb 24 00:01:49 <lispmacs[work]>	that seems plausible, I've got plenty of them
Feb 24 00:02:07 <lispmacs[work]>	but I don't understand why I cannot override the override
Feb 24 00:02:13 <thuna`>	What does C-h m report?
Feb 24 00:02:20 <bpalmer>	lispmacs[work]: global key map is consulted *after* minor modes
Feb 24 00:02:35 <bpalmer>	first it looks at overlays/extents. Then minor modes. Then major mode. Then the global keymap.
Feb 24 00:03:12 <lispmacs[work]>	https://bpa.st/5XOT4
Feb 24 00:04:25 <thuna`>	Hmm, what about `C-h k C-M-@' and `C-h k C-x r'?
Feb 24 00:05:04 <lispmacs[work]>	C-h k C-M-@ does nothing, as though it does not see the keys pressed at all... just continues to wait for any key to be pressed
Feb 24 00:05:37 <lispmacs[work]>	currently (after I rebooted) the C-x r command is working as it is supposed to
Feb 24 00:05:46 <lispmacs[work]>	calling the function I set
Feb 24 00:06:05 <thuna`>	Your WM is probably grabbing it then
Feb 24 00:08:18 <lispmacs[work]>	hmm, okay, maybe something changed in a recent gnome-shell update
Feb 24 00:20:59 <daviid>	hello! not sure if it is an emacs or gnome problem, but since my last debian testing update, a few hours ago, now this (partially reduced for the prupose of this quiz) "emacs --font "-Bits-Bitstream Vera Sans Mono-normal-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-m-0-iso10646-1"  => Warning: Missing charsets in String to FontSet conversion   and  buffers are not using the font or the rendering is 'incorrect', nor the menu nor the title bar font, see what
Feb 24 00:20:59 <daviid>	i get - https://imgur.com/a/B7aqXA0 - the fisrt image is how things are 'now' (after this update', and the second is how the font was rendered before ... does any onw know what i could do to 'track' and solve this problem? thanks!
Feb 24 00:25:24 <e3d3>	Does the font name really start with a hyphen ?
Feb 24 00:26:22 <daviid>	e3d3: i've used this argument 'as is' for the last few years,
Feb 24 00:29:35 <e3d3>	daviid: I only noticed it and don't know enough about it to help you
Feb 24 00:31:15 <daviid>	fwiw, i had to change a few years ago, because every 'now and then' the way font must be passed changes ... till a few years ago, i could launch emacs like this: emacs --font "-*-mono-*-*-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"    and it would be perfect
Feb 24 00:31:37 <e3d3>	but I tried it and it worked, without errors, here: AntiX23 (Debian variant)
Feb 24 00:32:19 <thuna`>	Hmm... on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad of an idea is it to update the string display text property by modifying string?  I'm leaning towards a 7.
Feb 24 00:36:52 <daviid>	anyway, how can i 'identifiy' the exact --font argument value i need to pass to emacs is the 'real' question - in my gnome terminals, i use "DejaVu Sans Mono", but selecting the font using the gnome interface ... i have no idea how to obtain the 'identical' font but so i can pass it to emacs --font ... anyone knows?
Feb 24 00:37:49 <cvandusen>	Maybe the same format as it's shown in M-x set-frame-font
Feb 24 00:37:51 <daviid>	e3d3: 'it works' doesn't mean anythig, i don't have errors here either, but clearly the font, as shown on my screenshots, are diff before and after my last debian update
Feb 24 00:39:32 <e3d3>	daviid: I agree, I formulated it bad, don't use Debian testing, and also have a bad eye for fonts. Sorry.
Feb 24 00:42:10 <daviid>	cvandusen: but, how do i 'transform' what i can see/set here - https://imgur.com/a/2Dvtai9 - which as you can see lands in the terminal setting user options as 'DejaVu Sans Mono 9" to what ever emacs accepts ?
Feb 24 00:45:39 <daviid>	as i don't know, i am asking for someone here who knows either to do that and paste the result, or tell me what algorithm i must use to do that, if i have 'to do it myself' - (gnome-font-viewer->emacs-font-optiona-name'DejaVu Sans Mono 9"
Feb 24 00:45:40 <cvandusen>	Supposedly, emacs -fn "DejaVu Sans Mono-9" should work.
Feb 24 00:45:44 <daviid>	sorry, error
Feb 24 00:46:17 <daviid>	but let me try that
Feb 24 00:46:28 <daviid>	with the hiphen?
Feb 24 00:48:11 <cvandusen>	Yes, though my test used Hack since I don't have DejaVu Sans Mono installed.
Feb 24 00:52:14 <daviid>	it seems to work - tx - misteriously though, the menubar and title bar font are totally 'bad', in terms of rendering, which i don't understand why either - yesterday, or before the last update, it was perfect, now here is what i get, using your suggestion emacs -fn "DejaVu Sans Mono-9" => Warning: Missing charsets in String to FontSet conversion   https://imgur.com/a/2Dvtai9   the second image of this paste, i just added it now ...
Feb 24 00:55:02 <cvandusen>	I have no idea about the warning. Lots of search results hits seem to indicate an OS level issue.
Feb 24 00:57:00 <daviid>	you see, the menubar and window title font are 'wrongly' rendered - it used to always work, here is an old screenshot, while i was using "-*-mono-*-*-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"  https://imgur.com/a/2Dvtai9   last image on this page ...
Feb 24 00:57:48 <daviid>	cvandusen: but ok, thanks, i'll survive, i actually hide both emacs menubar and window title bar in my real sessionsa anyway .. so ok
Feb 24 00:59:47 <cvandusen>	yw
Feb 24 01:09:37 <wgreenhouse>	daviid: the syntax cvandusen provided (family name as a string followed by hyphen followed by point size) is described in fontconfig documentation as the way to specify TTF/OTF fonts
Feb 24 01:09:43 <wgreenhouse>	a "TTF font name"
Feb 24 01:09:59 <wgreenhouse>	as opposed to that thing with the many hyphens which is an X11 font name
Feb 24 01:10:31 <wgreenhouse>	so that other style may have been one you adopted initially with old bitmap fonts
Feb 24 01:11:49 <daviid>	wgreenhouse: ok thanks
Feb 24 01:13:51 <daviid>	i still think something is wrong wrt the font rendering 'in emacs' - lokk at what i get 'here', if i launch gnome-font-viewer, and select "Mono", then  Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, and compare how the gnome font viewer renders the font on the screen (wayland backend here) and emacs - https://imgur.com/a/JIKeVEk - the emacs rendering is 'terrible', i wonder why, it used to be fine ...
Feb 24 01:15:32 <wgreenhouse>	daviid: it looks like there is no antialiasing, in the last shot
Feb 24 01:15:39 <wgreenhouse>	I wonder why that is
Feb 24 01:16:03 <wgreenhouse>	,,pgtk,, may be better. or worse.
Feb 24 01:16:04 <fsbot>	pgtk: [0] https://git.sr.ht/~oldosfan/emacs-pgtk
Feb 24 01:16:04 <fsbot>	[1] An Emacs fork with a pure GTK display feature that runs natively on Wayland
Feb 24 01:16:04 <fsbot>	[2] Fixes the infamous GTK crash: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2021-05/msg00340.html
Feb 24 01:16:22 <wgreenhouse>	it's no longer a fork, just a build option
Feb 24 01:16:34 <wgreenhouse>	but it removes XWayland from what might be going wrong, here
Feb 24 01:17:04 <wgreenhouse>	in principle it should be better but is also new
Feb 24 01:17:56 <daviid>	wgreenhouse: i switched to emacs-lucid a while ago, a few years ago, because i had a problem using emacs-gtk ... but i could try 'again' and see indeed
Feb 24 01:18:50 <daviid>	here is what i use  emacs-lucid  1:29.1+1-5  which deliberatly does not use gtk
Feb 24 01:18:59 <daviid>	and i wish i can stiull not depend on gtk
Feb 24 01:19:40 <daviid>	but i could try
Feb 24 01:22:40 <wgreenhouse>	daviid: and it's being displayed over XWayland?
Feb 24 01:23:04 <wgreenhouse>	my diagnosis is that antialiasing is not happening, which makes that particular font look really bad
Feb 24 01:23:21 <wgreenhouse>	when I used lucid builds it was always with bitmap fonts
Feb 24 01:23:41 <daviid>	wgreenhouse: i just installed emacs-gtk, let's see
Feb 24 01:24:38 <daviid>	how do i ask to launch an 'indenpendent' new emacs, so i can keep my 'opened' sessions?
Feb 24 01:25:23 <kickingvegas>	daviid: are you using emacsclient ?
Feb 24 01:25:23 <daviid>	wgreenhouse: same problem
Feb 24 01:26:21 <wgreenhouse>	daviid: ok, so maybe a fontconfig vs xwayland issue
Feb 24 01:27:11 <daviid>	wgreenhouse: here - https://imgur.com/a/qNffeZw
Feb 24 01:27:50 <daviid>	wgreenhouse: not sure i understand, do you happen to know how i can solve the problem?
Feb 24 01:28:15 <wgreenhouse>	daviid: yep same issue -- antialiasing is not happening, so the font appears granulated, instead of having clean strokes
Feb 24 01:29:18 <wgreenhouse>	daviid: a part of the font is essentially being ignored by your system
Feb 24 01:29:31 <wgreenhouse>	so it is appearing in a degraded ugly mode
Feb 24 01:30:03 <wgreenhouse>	this is a system-level issue almost always, with fontconfig, which is the lib that emacs relies on for font rendering
Feb 24 01:30:57 <daviid>	ok, many thanks
Feb 24 01:31:02 <wgreenhouse>	the fact that it looks fine in the gnome font preview tells me the issue is restricted to X clients, not Wayland ones
Feb 24 01:31:15 <wgreenhouse>	more than that is hard to say from here
Feb 24 01:33:14 <daviid>	i'll report in #debian-next (oftc), where i did ask already earlier today, they suggested i talk to the emacs 'guru' ... now i'll let them know what i tried and that it is likely a fontconfig lib problem, it was just updated today, now i run 2.15.0-1
Feb 24 01:33:23 <crook1389>	Hello. I was wondering if it's possible to run elisp in the compile buffer? I'm writing a tex file and I can do C-c C-a to compile and open the pdf.  However, I'm really used to using the compile buffer for most things and I have recompile bound to C-c r for convenience. So I'd ideally like to use that shortcut to do the equivalent of C-c C-a in tex files. Thanks.
Feb 24 01:34:24 <daviid>	wgreenhouse: many thanks, if i have some usefull news, i'll post here .. it's gona take a littke while, as i have to go afk now, bbl
Feb 24 01:35:02 <daviid>	i'll reinstall emacs-lucid, as this has nothing to do with the emacs 'flavor'
Feb 24 01:36:37 <dodoyada>	I'm using erc with erc-autojoin-timing 'ident and erc-autojoin-channels-alist '(("irc.libera.chat" "some" "channels")) but it doesn't autojoin.  Any idea what I might be doing wrong?
Feb 24 01:42:16 <VG234>	Good evening.. In Emacs chess is it possible to change the mouse point to be more visible when moving chess pieces?
Feb 24 01:43:33 <mns>	its in emacs, there must be a way to change it :-)
Feb 24 01:43:55 <VG234>	I agree.
Feb 24 02:00:44 <e3d3>	dodoyada: I don't use erc and I'm bad in elisp but because nobody reacts dare to ask: do you get an error for something like (setq erc-autojoin-channels-alist '(("irc.libera.chat" "#emacs" "#python")))
Feb 24 02:04:24 <VG234>	I use: ((".*\\.libera.chat" "#emacs"))
Feb 24 02:04:58 <VG234>	I'm note sure if irc will work.
Feb 24 02:05:18 <e3d3>	works for me
Feb 24 02:06:51 <e3d3>	sorry, I'm using rcirc, not erc :)
Feb 24 02:08:14 <bpalmer>	why are you setting erc-autojoin-channels-alist?
Feb 24 02:09:13 <bpalmer>	crook1389: it's possible to set up a new keybinding, sure.
Feb 24 02:09:34 <bpalmer>	crook1389: I discovered recently that just g will also recompile in compilation buffers
Feb 24 02:10:08 <bpalmer>	that said, I don't know what C-c C-a does in tex files; I just opened one and it isn't bound for me
Feb 24 02:24:19 <grym>	https://tildegit.org/grym/rofi-pinboard  well that was fun
Feb 24 02:33:27 <VG234>	I don't think I can change the mouse pointer for chess unless it has an xpm file that controls it.
Feb 24 02:36:00 <VG234>	It seems emacs chess graphical mode sets the mouse point to text more or at least text symbol.

Feb 24 17:29:03 <heistema>	I am using a self-compiled Emacs 29.2 btw.
Feb 24 17:29:13 <wgreenhouse>	heistema: eglot is built in
Feb 24 17:32:23 <heistema>	@wgreenhouse: Yes, that's why I am wondering as well. I am just assuming that he is downloading the eglot package again because of the elpaca-use-package in my elpaca-setup.el ... However, jsonrpc seems to be a component eglot uses but I cannot download or upgrade through emacs as it seems to be no package ?!
Feb 24 17:37:36 <johnjaye>	json is also built-in to emacs isn't it?
Feb 24 17:38:13 <johnjaye>	libjansson-dev
Feb 24 17:39:09 <wgreenhouse>	heistema: yes, emacs builds in json support
Feb 24 17:39:09 <thuna`>	There's json and jsonrpc, both are built-in
Feb 24 17:39:11 <heistema>	@johnjaye: Yes, and the use-package clause in my config.el shouldn't download packages, normally, right?
Feb 24 17:39:30 <wgreenhouse>	heistema: normally use-package would only do so with :ensure
Feb 24 17:39:39 <wgreenhouse>	no idea if elpaca changes that
Feb 24 17:40:10 <wgreenhouse>	I suspect your emacs either was built without json support, or has downloaded some old eglot
Feb 24 17:41:59 <heistema>	@wgreenhouse: The error in my config (https://bpa.st/5OIGA) is also reproducable with the default arch emacs package (NOT aur)...
Feb 24 17:44:47 <wgreenhouse>	heistema: is it reproducible with -q?
Feb 24 17:46:43 <johnjaye>	what feature or mechanism does emacs use to get jsonrpc?
Feb 24 17:46:57 <johnjaye>	i don't see it in configure.ac or in my emacs configure options list
Feb 24 17:47:47 <heistema>	@johnjaye: I am looking for days now for this error and there is nothing I found on your excellent question as well
Feb 24 17:47:50 <wgreenhouse>	johnjaye: --with-json
Feb 24 17:48:04 <wgreenhouse>	as ./configure option
Feb 24 17:48:14 <wgreenhouse>	only since 28 iirc
Feb 24 17:48:51 <wgreenhouse>	heistema: does your ~/.emacs.d/elpa contain an eglot?
Feb 24 17:48:56 <wgreenhouse>	if it does, it shouldn't
Feb 24 17:49:29 <famubu>	tazjin: Thanks for the answer about using `(interactive)`! Sorry had dropped off.
Feb 24 17:49:42 <famubu>	I was able to make it work.
Feb 24 17:50:01 <heistema>	~/.config/emacs/elpaca/repos does indeed contain an eglot!?
Feb 24 17:50:47 <johnjaye>	oh so it's part of jansson then?
Feb 24 17:51:49 <johnjaye>	the only reference to rpc in configure.ac is powerpc.
Feb 24 17:51:55 <wgreenhouse>	heistema: it shouldn't
Feb 24 17:52:08 <wgreenhouse>	blow it up!
Feb 24 17:52:45 <wgreenhouse>	heistema: better yet fogure out how it got there
Feb 24 17:52:48 <wgreenhouse>	*figure
Feb 24 17:57:02 <heistema>	This is nearly all there is to reproduce: https://bpa.st/5OIGA

Feb 24 17:57:18 <shrysr>	YO ! howz everybody doing
Feb 24 17:57:41 <wgreenhouse>	heistema: well idk anything about elpaca itself
Feb 24 17:58:05 <wgreenhouse>	so the config doesn't really help me
Feb 24 17:58:17 <wgreenhouse>	clearly it's decided based on that config to download eglot
Feb 24 17:58:58 <wgreenhouse>	hopefully someone else here has used it before
Feb 24 17:59:10 <johnjaye>	first i've heard of it. even doom uses use-package
Feb 24 17:59:49 <wgreenhouse>	heistema: but yes, you've found few references to this issue because emacs29 itself doesn't have an issue
Feb 24 18:00:06 <wgreenhouse>	eglot is built in and just works in an emacs compiled with json support
Feb 24 18:00:21 <wgreenhouse>	the issue is your config
Feb 24 18:01:22 <johnjaye>	would it be possible to just start a shell, export HOME=$HOME/foo, then start emacs manually setup elpaca or what not and build up his config to work properly?
Feb 24 18:01:59 <wgreenhouse>	definitely, that'd be an approach
Feb 24 18:02:03 <corwin>	morning shrysr!  doing okay; how's with you?
Feb 24 18:02:33 <wgreenhouse>	emacs29 even has an --init-dir arg to aid that kind of testing
Feb 24 18:02:43 <johnjaye>	ok. i'll try that instead next time i want to test something
Feb 24 18:02:51 <shrysr>	hiya corwin glad you are okay. I am good! Setting up furniture today :)
Feb 24 18:02:59 <johnjaye>	warning: do NOT use /tmp for this. emacs changes its behavior if it sees your current-directory is in /tmp
Feb 24 18:03:10 <shrysr>	eh elpaca != use-package afaik
Feb 24 18:03:14 <johnjaye>	i went through a mess with auto backup over it
Feb 24 18:03:24 <grym>	elpaca is "the new straight"
Feb 24 18:03:39 <grym>	both of which can _use_ use-package, but use-package itself stands alone
Feb 24 18:03:57 <johnjaye>	why is the default emacs packaging not good enough
Feb 24 18:05:03 <heistema>	@shrysr yes, but in my config files (https://bpa.st/5OIGA) I am using elpaca-use-package and elpaca-use-package-mode... I guess that's the reason why I have a copy of eglot as @wgreenhouse suggested
Feb 24 18:05:31 <corwin>	It might be heading toward good enough, at this point (notwithstanding actual bugs of which there are def several).  Recent additions include the ability to install from a git repo vs just from an ELPA, which was straight.el's central/killer feature once upon a time.
Feb 24 18:05:33 <grym>	heistema: i think just don't use elpaca-use-packge for eglot
Feb 24 18:05:38 <grym>	heistema: use use-package instead
Feb 24 18:05:51 <johnjaye>	that's... interesting.
Feb 24 18:05:52 <grym>	corwin: that's certainly why i use straight
Feb 24 18:06:23 <johnjaye>	is it git specifically or will it take hg or sv repos potentially?
Feb 24 18:06:34 <corwin>	grym: very well; I'll consider that guess more or less confirmed ;)
Feb 24 18:06:46 <shrysr>	I think there is a elpaca-use-package-mode in that config which means that any use-package will be... overridden by whatever elpaca does?
Feb 24 18:06:52 <corwin>	johnjaye: that's an excellent question; I don't know.
Feb 24 18:06:55 <johnjaye>	you could define src-retrieval-function as insurance against when git isn't around
Feb 24 18:07:17 <heistema>	@johnjaye You are absolutely right, I shouldn't have gone with Elpaca in the first place... I started using Emacs about one year ago. I "wrote" my config watching a tutorial and evolved it a bit... Now after having to reinstall my laptop I ran in those issues and cannot use my config any more
Feb 24 18:07:17 <grym>	johnjaye: it's not just git
Feb 24 18:07:25 <grym>	johnjaye: https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el?tab=readme-ov-file#where-do-repositories-come-from
Feb 24 18:07:52 <shrysr>	iirc straight had an option for using built-in.
Feb 24 18:07:55 <grym>	heistema: using elpaca is potentially fine! maybe don't use the thing that aliases use-packge to elpaca-use-package
Feb 24 18:08:00 <grym>	shrysr: it does that too
Feb 24 18:08:01 <johnjaye>	heistema: i'm not the best person to ask because i keep my config "minimal", as in < 1000 lines and most of it is setting up font sizes or OS-specific things and I use it on all my machines. Anything else I load explicitly.
Feb 24 18:08:04 <shrysr>	https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el?tab=readme-ov-file#how-can-i-use-the-built-in-version-of-a-package
Feb 24 18:08:05 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/47gtgDtCrC
Feb 24 18:09:19 <grym>	i think elpaca would be interesting if i was more regularly rebuilding all my packages or whatever
Feb 24 18:09:22 <grym>	... but i'm not
Feb 24 18:09:35 <corwin>	Probably more attractive to guix/arch users.
Feb 24 18:10:13 <corwin>	If I have my whole system rebuilding regularly to follow upstreams, why not my Emacs packages?
Feb 24 18:10:31 <corwin>	(In fact, I have an answer to that, but then I'm not using guix either)
Feb 24 18:10:57 <grym>	i mean, i use arch too
Feb 24 18:11:17 <johnjaye>	in freebsd you in theory rebuild everything using ports if you want to
Feb 24 18:11:19 <grym>	but my time with ubuntu, and also my current life in python, has taught me some lessons that serve me well in emacs
Feb 24 18:11:22 <grym>	which is
Feb 24 18:11:35 <grym>	"the distro is not to be trusted with things that actually matter for development"
Feb 24 18:11:40 <grym>	(and all emacs users are developers!)
Feb 24 18:11:48 <johnjaye>	grym:  such as?
Feb 24 18:11:58 <grym>	johnjaye: such as what
Feb 24 18:12:18 <johnjaye>	like libraries, your autoconf, your compiler, your ....
Feb 24 18:12:34 <johnjaye>	pretty much anything you have to use for development is provided by the distro
Feb 24 18:12:52 <johnjaye>	you have to explicitly go out of your way to set it all up yourself
Feb 24 18:12:57 <grym>	i mean my entire python dev setup (and emacs config setup) doesn't involve my distro package manager
Feb 24 18:13:16 <johnjaye>	i see
Feb 24 18:13:35 <grym>	there's some blurry lines there (namely, cuda for python, and where emacs itself comes from, for emacs), but there's a pretty bright line as well
Feb 24 18:13:40 <johnjaye>	i just say this because gcc is not fun to compile
Feb 24 18:13:44 <grym>	sure
Feb 24 18:13:57 <grym>	what i mean is "i'm not going to apt-install magit, or numpy"
Feb 24 18:14:19 <johnjaye>	ah ok
Feb 24 18:14:29 <ym>	I want emacs with built-in graphics.
Feb 24 18:14:30 <grym>	... or use system python for development at all, really
Feb 24 18:14:34 <grym>	ym: it.. has them?
Feb 24 18:14:56 <ym>	Does it?
Feb 24 18:15:09 <grym>	i seem to be able to view images in emacs, yes
Feb 24 18:15:43 <ym>	No, I mean immanent graphics, from first principles.
Feb 24 18:15:50 <corwin>	Emacs will build using most of the required graphics libraries (e.g. rsvg) given they are found when running ./configure
Feb 24 18:16:04 <ym>	So that emac's core rendered it's appearance.
Feb 24 18:16:14 <grym>	that sounds more like word salad, sory
Feb 24 18:16:15 <ym>	Via DRM/KMS maybe.
Feb 24 18:16:39 <shrysr>	grym does apt install numpy respect virtual env or requirements.txt? I am guessing it doesnot.
Feb 24 18:16:49 <grym>	shrysr: absolutely not
Feb 24 18:16:50 <wgreenhouse>	grym: I think they mean writing emacs like a game engine
Feb 24 18:16:53 <heistema>	@ym: Do you mean you want Emacs to render itself directly using the graphics device?
Feb 24 18:16:55 <grym>	shrysr: which is, in fact, the whole problem.
Feb 24 18:17:01 <shrysr>	ah
Feb 24 18:17:09 <wgreenhouse>	using sdl or some other immediate mode framebuffer lib
Feb 24 18:17:12 <grym>	shrysr: just like ghostbusters: don't cross the streams!
Feb 24 18:17:18 <shrysr>	:)
Feb 24 18:17:19 <ym>	heistema, yes, and it should have basic graphics functions.
Feb 24 18:17:40 <corwin>	Emacs is built with cario; I suppose one could do something with dynamic modules and try taking over some stuff from the display engine.  I'd guess significant patching of the Emacs c code would be needed but I don't really know.
Feb 24 18:17:41 <ym>	But not SDL, of course.
Feb 24 18:17:52 <ym>	libdrm would be perfect.
Feb 24 18:17:58 <wgreenhouse>	ym: patches welcome :) a framebuffer port is something I would try
Feb 24 18:18:25 <corwin>	probably a replacment for xdisp.c or smth?
Feb 24 18:19:27 <ym>	wgreenhouse, rather new emacs-like editor written from scratch.
Feb 24 18:20:25 <corwin>	gl;hf
Feb 24 18:20:33 <johnjaye>	emacs on the framebuffer? wat
Feb 24 18:20:34 <Odin-LAP>	ym: You might be interested in looking at the history of lisp machines.
Feb 24 18:20:47 <ym>	Odin-LAP, I did.
Feb 24 18:21:18 <ym>	corwin, xdisp rely on xlib?
Feb 24 18:21:35 <wgreenhouse>	ym: yes and Xft
Feb 24 18:22:17 <e1f>	iirc from examining the emacs redisplay code many years afo, emacs still believes it's writing to a text display; the graphical output is "faked" for lack of a better term
Feb 24 18:22:58 <e1f>	it's like emacs is living in the matrix
Feb 24 18:24:24 <grym>	yep! https://web.archive.org/web/20161030212109/https://www.facebook.com/notes/daniel-colascione/buttery-smooth-emacs/10155313440066102/
Feb 24 18:24:25 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/lG0ozIGDfV
Feb 24 18:24:45 <grym>	"One day, a fool wanted to run Emacs in a GUI as a native GUI program. The rest is ChangeLog."
Feb 24 18:26:14 <e1f>	that was morpheus, who wanted to free everyone's mind
Feb 24 18:26:18 <heistema>	The elpaca-use-package mode does not have an option to make an exception for an internal package? Like straight.el does support?
Feb 24 18:27:36 <ym>	grym, nice article!
Feb 24 18:27:47 <shrysr>	i thought morpheus just wanted to find neo
Feb 24 18:27:55 <wgreenhouse>	rudybot: seen quotemstr
Feb 24 18:27:55 <rudybot>	wgreenhouse: quotemstr was seen joining in #emacs twelve weeks ago, and then quotemstr was seen quitting seven weeks ago, saying "Remote host closed the connection"
Feb 24 18:28:08 <wgreenhouse>	ym: ^ author of said article
Feb 24 18:28:25 <e1f>	yes, in his search for neo he was freeing others from the matrix
Feb 24 18:33:17 <johnjaye>	>Redisplay essentially diffs the last-known display configuration and what it’s supposed to be displaying right now, then emits a minimal set of terminal control codes needed to change the last-known state to the current-good state.
Feb 24 18:37:28 <wgreenhouse>	johnjaye: ncurses does this too
Feb 24 18:37:38 <wgreenhouse>	emacs has been doing it since before ncurses existed
Feb 24 18:37:59 <wgreenhouse>	it was a needed algorithm for being a screen editor on a terminal over a phone line
Feb 24 18:49:28 <shrysr>	wgreenhouse: is ncurses a requisite to run recent (v 28) emacs on the terminal?
Feb 24 18:51:36 <shrysr>	i seem to recall that i needed to compile ncurses to be able to use terminal emacs on a remote $work server. old post.. but seems to suggest something similar> https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/34588/does-emacs-use-ncurses-to-render-in-the-terminal
Feb 24 18:57:19 <johnjaye>	i wonder which is better, event driven or concurrent gui design
Feb 24 18:57:57 <wgreenhouse>	shrysr: yes, ldd {which emacs} shows emacs29 does link against libncursesw.so.6
Feb 24 18:58:33 <wgreenhouse>	shrysr: no idea how much of that damage algorithm mentioned earlier has moved from emacs to ncurses, or if there are large bits of it emacs still does itself
Feb 24 18:59:06 <wgreenhouse>	ncurses might be used just for terminfo/termcap stuff, idk
Feb 24 18:59:40 <wgreenhouse>	johnjaye: both can be good, both can suck
Feb 24 19:03:09 <garrett>	is it possible to create a new repository on github using magit/forge?
Feb 24 19:11:48 <shrysr>	idk about github, but with sr.ht  it was possible create a repo with just a git push (magit) as long you added proper remote including username
Feb 24 19:12:58 <shrysr>	hm reading https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps doesnt seem to explicitly mention creating repos.
Feb 24 19:14:19 <shrysr>	ty wgreenhouse
Feb 24 19:14:44 <wgreenhouse>	yw
Feb 24 19:15:01 <Odin-LAP>	wgreenhouse: Does ncurses support DOS?

Feb 25 02:09:50 *	Topic for #emacs set by e1f!~user@user/e1f (Wed Feb 14 17:01:13 2024)
Feb 25 02:10:43 <lavendar>	e1f: but you would agree that there needs to be some mistake in the .emacs file?
Feb 25 02:11:28 <lavendar>	because then I would like to find it rather soon...
Feb 25 02:23:16 <lavendar>	tbh, it doesn't seem like my .emacs file contains errors, I am confused
Feb 25 02:56:50 <ellis>	sup yall
Feb 25 03:43:09 <notzmv>	chatgpt just hit us with a new motto for emacs: anything less is simply unacceptable
Feb 25 04:16:39 <grym>	hodapp: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00152  hee hee.  old, but HN just remembered it
Feb 25 04:32:10 <johnjaye>	is that just a fancy way of saying LLMs make an average of all the facts they know?
Feb 25 04:34:08 <grym>	johnjaye: and nothing else
Feb 25 04:34:33 <grym>	johnjaye: i am very dubious about the use of the words "fact" and "know" in your framing, though
Feb 25 04:35:01 <johnjaye>	chatgpt. it knows!
Feb 25 04:42:23 <grym>	turns out, it don't
Feb 25 04:42:46 <grym>	every time i hear "kernel method" though, the only thing i think of is fourier transforms
Feb 25 04:54:17 <hodapp>	grym: I have had that paper around but not yet comprehended it well enough to do anything with it
Feb 25 04:54:21 <hodapp>	I read it around when it came out
Feb 25 05:46:12 <twb>	Did you know Linux includes a TLS library and you can "offload" TLS from nginx to the kernel, to avoid kernelspace-to-userspace copy costs?
Feb 25 05:47:51 <twb>	Did you know OpenZFS's Linux driver includes a copy of Lua 5.2 that runs lua scripts in-kernel
Feb 25 05:48:36 <twb>	If you run this as a ZFS channel program, it'll break your kernel:  local function f(s) s:gsub(".", f) return "x" end f("foo"); return tostring(setmetatable({},{__tostring=function(t) string.format("%s",t) end}))
Feb 25 06:29:47 <C0MMIE>	hey have you folks ever heard about public libraries?
Feb 25 06:31:00 <C0MMIE>	they have a ton of free content, and you can take it home or even log on to their databases from your own device. you just need to talk them into issuing a "library card"
Feb 25 06:32:14 <wgreenhouse>	C0MMIE: yes, they're great
Feb 25 06:33:05 <wgreenhouse>	librarians are also total badasses, when it comes to protecting freedom of information and patrons' confidentiality
Feb 25 06:33:06 <C0MMIE>	I got the new York public library to issue me a temporary card and I don't even live in New york
Feb 25 06:34:15 <C0MMIE>	Washington DC won't do that though. or Chicago. or sandiego. or la. or San Francisco.
Feb 25 06:34:37 <C0MMIE>	Carnegie did, tho. and the Philadelphia free library.
Feb 25 06:34:50 <technomancy>	usually you don't lose access by moving away either
Feb 25 06:35:38 <bpalmer>	every library I've had a card at will eventually expire the card and require renewal
Feb 25 06:36:30 <C0MMIE>	hard to believe Chicago and San Fran are hardasses about residency but whatever. between the three that did give me cards, I have a ton of content. why do people pay to stream literally anything? or tolerate ads?!
Feb 25 06:36:42 <bpalmer>	private university libraries have been the closest to user hostile that I've seen (great towards members of their community, fairly gated towards "outsiders", particularly non-academic outsiders)
Feb 25 06:39:06 <technomancy>	why people tolerate ads has always been a mystery to me
Feb 25 06:39:20 <technomancy>	ublock origin is so good and so easy
Feb 25 06:40:05 <bpalmer>	Because ad-supported services have a lower entrance requirement than fee-supported services.
Feb 25 07:00:35 <bpalmer>	rudybot: remember to close your eyes while driving whenever a billboard appears through the window.
Feb 25 07:00:36 <rudybot>	bpalmer: that's the only real sense that a person is a "product" in advertising, but it's no different than seeing a billboard when driving down the street. The owner got paid to put that ad in front of all those drivers.
Feb 25 07:54:10 <SincereFox>	is thre a way to do mind maps in emacs?
Feb 25 07:56:08 <corwin>	Mainly I think of https://kungsgeten.github.io/org-brain.html but there is also a somewhat stale https://github.com/the-ted/org-mind-map
Feb 25 07:56:41 <SincereFox>	corwin: Hey nice to see you around here too, thanks! I'll check those
Feb 25 08:03:30 <SincereFox>	I saw a teacher using that "brain" (not the emacs software) once, it sounded like a glorified wiki to me, I am watching the emacs one demo and that one does looks awesome ( totally not emacs biased message :P )
Feb 25 08:10:41 <Viking667>	whoa. Hadn't realised I was on the server. Back soon, stupid Chrome can't find a running password manager.
Feb 25 08:54:30 <sandra>	Just had a weird interaction with Emacs when I had used replace-string on some RTL isolates, and then when I went to do replace-string again, the modeline had those isolates in the "default" expression, so when I was writing the new replacement strings it thought I was writing RTL.
Feb 25 08:54:30 <sandra>	Nothing I couldn't fix easily (just search for a not-in-this-particular-buffer plain text word like zebra and replace it with blank or whatever) but maybe something that could trip up someone else.
Feb 25 08:54:30 <sandra>	I'm talking about the text that says "Replace string (default foo → bar): "; if that string as a whole contains unterminated bidi isolates, perhaps they should get popped. I dunno.
Feb 25 09:31:53 <ahilariousr>	what is a symbol? '( some code here)
Feb 25 09:56:23 <thuna`>	Morning!
Feb 25 09:56:40 <sham1>	Morning
Feb 25 11:33:25 <bodiccea_>	in makefile mode, indent-tabs-mode is obviously true. But would it be possible to use tabs only at start of rules actions ? For example, inserting comments at comment-column would have only spaces before the comment start
Feb 25 11:35:56 <APic>	Moin
Feb 25 11:35:57 <APic>	,BotSnack
Feb 25 11:35:58 <fsbot>	my favourite snack!

Feb 28 00:05:56 <mekeor>	what's a nice way to make compose-mail (C-x m) ask me which e-mail-address i want to use? i use 'gnus as mail-user-agent. when replying to mail, the address is already chosen well, thanks to my personal value of gnus-posting-styles variable.
Feb 28 00:05:59 <mwnaylor>	mekeor: Not published, officially. I have a github repo for emacs hacking. https://github.com/mark-naylor-1701/elisp-hacking
Feb 28 00:07:27 <mwnaylor>	Look for text-decoration.el. Everything here is rough and not ready for prime-time, in my opinion. It works for me; if someone finds it interesting, great.
Feb 28 00:12:14 <mekeor>	thanks for sharing!
Feb 28 00:12:38 *	mekeor wonders what's the share of licenses in the set of emacs packages
Feb 28 00:14:26 <mekeor>	pretty surprising that package.el does not know about licenses
Feb 28 00:18:33 <technomancy>	I think the assumption was that no one would be weird enough to use a non-GPL license for elisp
Feb 28 00:19:08 <technomancy>	normally I'd say that's not a bad assumption, but on the other hand, have you met elisp developers?
Feb 28 00:19:54 <mfisher>	haha
Feb 28 00:21:42 <lispmacs[work]>	Tεstιng, 1, 2, 3
Feb 28 00:21:42 <lispmacs[work]>	𝘏𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘰 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘭𝘥!
Feb 28 00:21:42 <lispmacs[work]>	𝗜𝘁'𝘀 𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲!
Feb 28 00:21:53 <johnjaye>	what is. a mac?
Feb 28 00:22:32 <mwnaylor>	lispmacs[work]: How did you post the Unicode?
Feb 28 00:22:56 <lispmacs[work]>	post it?
Feb 28 00:23:24 <mwnaylor>	How did you create the Unicode characters?
Feb 28 00:23:50 <lispmacs[work]>	I just used these nifty -region functions from your library
Feb 28 00:24:21 <lispmacs[work]>	sεεms to be 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁
Feb 28 00:24:34 <bpalmer>	I don't publish elisp, but when I do, it's BSD.
Feb 28 00:25:02 <bpalmer>	RMS has in the past asserted that stuff written in elisp must be GPL because it is a derived work of emacs.
Feb 28 00:25:57 <mwnaylor>	Wow! Thanks for that. Total impostor syndrome here. It works for me, but I wrote it for me. Not sure anyone else would find it useful.
Feb 28 00:26:22 <lispmacs[work]>	I downloaded the repo and then load that file from my init.el
Feb 28 00:26:28 <sham1>	Well, of course RMS is not a lawyer so that at least checks out that he'd have weird thoughts about that
Feb 28 00:26:41 <lispmacs[work]>	had to install a few packages from guix first
Feb 28 00:27:29 <mekeor>	bpalmer: c'mon, why bsd? why not gpl?
Feb 28 00:27:49 <mwnaylor>	bpalmer: I've played w/ FreeBSD in the past. I've got about 20 years Slackware experience, which I can't justify going back on. If forced to choose a new OS, it would be FreeBSD.
Feb 28 00:28:16 <JohnGalt>	RMS is neurotic
Feb 28 00:28:18 <mekeor>	mwnaylor: i think bpalmer was talking about the bsd license, not bsd OS
Feb 28 00:28:34 <bpalmer>	or maybe MIT. I forget which one is better about patents.
Feb 28 00:28:54 <sham1>	Well MIT doesn't make any claims about patents, that's for sure
Feb 28 00:28:56 <JohnGalt>	BSD 2 clause is the most minimal other than public domain IIRC
Feb 28 00:29:11 <technomancy>	I thought Apache was roughly the only non-copyleft license that has patent protection
Feb 28 00:29:15 <bpalmer>	I do really like BSD 3 clause
Feb 28 00:29:17 <JohnGalt>	communism != freedom
Feb 28 00:29:30 <mekeor>	copyleft != communism
Feb 28 00:29:38 <mekeor>	communism == freedom
Feb 28 00:29:45 <mekeor>	ask technomancy
Feb 28 00:29:53 <technomancy>	I guess apache's goofy "you have to put the license on every single file" bit is less annoying in elisp than it would be in other languages
Feb 28 00:29:57 <bpalmer>	mekeor: because any elisp I write is probably only worthwhile broken up into snippets to glue stuff together.
Feb 28 00:30:04 <JohnGalt>	no copyleft is forced sharing
Feb 28 00:30:07 <JohnGalt>	that is communism
Feb 28 00:30:26 <bpalmer>	mekeor: there's no reason to try to make people share their glue
Feb 28 00:30:27 <thuna`>	I do 0bsd for *really* short code and gpl3+ for everything else
Feb 28 00:30:54 <technomancy>	bpalmer: what if your friend wants to sniff it
Feb 28 00:31:02 <JohnGalt>	somebodies gotta force everyone into their beliefs, might as welll be GPL
Feb 28 00:31:24 <grym>	sniffing is fine; i draw the line at huffing
Feb 28 00:31:24 <sham1>	The problem with the legal theory of "Public Domain" for this stuff is that such a concept simply doesn't exist everywhere as such. (Of course, IANAL) From what I can tell, in more civil law jurisdiction contexts, where you instead have "authorial rights" instead of "copyright", it's not that trivial to just give away said rights
Feb 28 00:31:32 <JohnGalt>	are you going to send missionaries to my house too?
Feb 28 00:32:00 <grym>	mm, huffman coding
Feb 28 00:32:33 <bpalmer>	a big hipmunk fan, eh?
Feb 28 00:32:45 <JohnGalt>	I have his book The art of Doing Science and Engineering
Feb 28 00:32:47 <JohnGalt>	fun so far
Feb 28 00:32:53 <grym>	no no i just don't like losing things
Feb 28 00:33:02 <sham1>	Well, the technical term would be "authors' rights" but I suppose authorial rights also works
Feb 28 00:33:27 <bpalmer>	JohnGalt: that's Hamming.
Feb 28 00:33:52 <grym>	he had a coding too, but he's more famous for his windows
Feb 28 00:34:00 <JohnGalt>	bpalmer: your right
Feb 28 00:34:06 <grym>	my left!
Feb 28 00:34:28 <technomancy>	oh noooo the page hosting the Look at This Cool Rock I Found Public License 1.0 has gone away
Feb 28 00:34:31 <grym>	the gods of signal processing all seem to  get window functions named after them
Feb 28 00:35:39 <mwnaylor>	I realize the difference between the OS and the license. But, I believe they come from the same philosophy.
Feb 28 00:36:09 <technomancy>	archive.org doesn't have it =(
Feb 28 00:37:50 <JohnGalt>	man ediff is super nice on a big screen
Feb 28 00:38:25 <grym>	many things are nice on a big screen!
Feb 28 00:38:36 <grym>	perhap one day i will understand ediff, but not today
Feb 28 00:38:48 <bpalmer>	rudybot: 180 degree curved monitor, or 4 screens side by side?
Feb 28 00:38:48 <rudybot>	bpalmer: woks are curved. Induction stoves are flat.
Feb 28 00:39:07 <Odin-LAP>	sham1: The reason droit d'auteur isn't easily dropped is that it was originally conceived of as inalienable, which is a sharp contrast with the solidly economic (and thus saleable) copyright of the UK.
Feb 28 00:39:31 <mwnaylor>	rudybot: woks are flat on the bottom
Feb 28 00:39:31 <rudybot>	mwnaylor: I'm really delighted that I've written the first thing that I consider to be a real program in Racket. Albeit a very simple program in the grand scheme of things, it woks on an external file and produces an external file with new information.
Feb 28 00:39:32 <grym>	originally ... like 150 years ago :P
Feb 28 00:39:57 <Odin-LAP>	grym: I'm a historian. That's recent. :)
Feb 28 00:40:27 <JohnGalt>	I dont get curved screens
Feb 28 00:40:40 <JohnGalt>	wouldn't that cause eye strain?
Feb 28 00:40:43 <thuna`>	Uhh... please tell me customize's "erase customizations" is reversible
Feb 28 00:40:56 <mwnaylor>	Woks are great. I've used mine to make pasta and sausage gravy.
Feb 28 00:41:07 <JohnGalt>	thuna`: version control is reversable
Feb 28 00:41:22 <thuna`>	JohnGalt: that is not helpful advice at this point
Feb 28 00:41:25 <Odin-LAP>	Also, that's why CC0 is really useful, and FSF is silly for claiming it's any worse than the "liberal licenses".
Feb 28 00:41:55 <bpalmer>	thuna`: did you revert the session or permanently?
Feb 28 00:42:09 <bpalmer>	thuna`: or, actually , what was "erase customizations" ?
Feb 28 00:42:19 <JohnGalt>	do you have time machine?
Feb 28 00:42:34 <thuna`>	There was an "Erase Customizations" option in the menu for "state"
Feb 28 00:43:37 <bpalmer>	thuna`: oh, no, in the menu that seems to be what  "revert permanently"  means in the buttons
Feb 28 00:44:15 <JohnGalt>	other machines?
Feb 28 00:44:21 <bpalmer>	thuna`: check to see if your custom.el (or init.el if you don't split up your custom files) has an emacs produced backup
Feb 28 00:44:24 <bpalmer>	e.g., init.el~
Feb 28 00:44:53 <thuna`>	JohnGalt: I only have one.  bpalmer: custom.el wasn't open so it doesn't have history but let me see ~
Feb 28 00:45:12 <sham1>	Odin-LAP: right, but given the existence of the Bern convention, which is supposed to harmonise the economic copyright and these rights of the author, it makes it quite odd to apply
Feb 28 00:45:46 <mwnaylor>	My .emacs resides in its own directory that is also a git repo. I symlink to that from ~/.
Feb 28 00:45:47 <sham1>	Also from a philosophical point of view, it's weird to have a right that you can't renounce
Feb 28 00:45:47 <thuna`>	bpalmer: custom.el~ has it!  Thank you very much
Feb 28 00:46:05 <Odin-LAP>	sham1: Supposed, yes, but funnily enough the only thing the UK and US took from the others was extending the duration.
Feb 28 00:46:15 <bpalmer>	thuna`: and I do suggest making a repository right away with your configuration after you restore it.
Feb 28 00:46:41 <ski>	rudybot: The Bourne convention is superior to Sun's
Feb 28 00:46:42 <rudybot>	ski: it's one of those crossover movies (i think). it's really a romance movie but they added jason bourne running around to the trailer to attract the guys
Feb 28 00:46:44 <bpalmer>	at the very least, just go into ~/.emacs.d and do "git init; git add init.el custom.el; git commit -m 'Backup'"  if you like git
Feb 28 00:46:49 <JohnGalt>	git init ; git add -A ; git commit
Feb 28 00:46:51 <Odin-LAP>	sham1: Have you ever heard about the concept of "human rights"?
Feb 28 00:46:54 <thuna`>	What's a decent commit strategy?  That's what put me off of makig a repository until now
Feb 28 00:47:02 <JohnGalt>	git flow
Feb 28 00:47:07 <JohnGalt>	if you want it complicated
Feb 28 00:47:24 <JohnGalt>	otherwise just a master or main branch and a devel branch
Feb 28 00:47:58 <JohnGalt>	when you want to do a milestone do: git checkout master ; git merge --no-ff develop
Feb 28 00:48:18 <mwnaylor>	bpalmer: Great advice. Did you, like me, learn that the hard way by breaking a config system and have to undo the damage w/o backup?
Feb 28 00:48:20 <JohnGalt>	--no-ff makes a commit instead of fast forwarding so you can revert
Feb 28 00:48:36 <bpalmer>	mwnaylor: aye, I've broken many a thing.
Feb 28 00:49:02 <sham1>	Odin-LAP: I have, but I can also partially renounce other rights. For example, analogously to the way the authorial rights work, freedom of movement would mean that I would *have* to move about

Feb 28 02:13:38 <JohnGalt>	Russia, Venezuala, Hippies, etc...
Feb 28 02:13:49 <JohnGalt>	China bailed
Feb 28 02:14:46 <JohnGalt>	Isnt it funny how fast the boomers went from hippies to investors in the 80's ? lol.
Feb 28 02:20:05 <twb>	JohnGalt: you said "all".
Feb 28 02:22:41 <habamax>	sweeden
Feb 28 02:23:32 <bremner>	canada has definitely become a gulag since the introduction of single payer healthcare
Feb 28 02:23:53 <JohnGalt>	our health care is in the toilet now too

Feb 28 02:24:50 <twb>	bremner: when was that, 1905?
Feb 28 02:25:01 <habamax>	Canada is Main Camp Governance
Feb 28 02:25:02 <bremner>	twb: 1960s, iirc
Feb 28 02:25:09 <twb>	Wow, late
Feb 28 02:25:25 <twb>	Most counties that aren't New Zealand did it right after WWII
Feb 28 02:25:44 <bremner>	twb: I blame the Fenian raids
Feb 28 02:25:55 <JohnGalt>	I am glad tcp/ip has a monopoly on the internet :]
Feb 28 02:26:04 <JohnGalt>	monopolies can be good
Feb 28 02:26:13 <habamax>	use null-modems!
Feb 28 02:26:48 <twb>	bremner: so... Fenians are pro-Irish-indepdendence Americans who tried to wreck Canada to distract England from Ireland?
Feb 28 02:27:00 <JohnGalt>	thankfully webkit is establishing a homogenous browser landscape
Feb 28 02:27:19 <johnjaye>	what emacs package or modes would you like to see this year?
Feb 28 02:27:32 <johnjaye>	i'm curious if we can do a straw poll or something like that.
Feb 28 02:27:42 <bremner>	twb: something like that
Feb 28 02:27:50 <JohnGalt>	I would leave VSCode if I could get tabnine AI complete
Feb 28 02:27:52 <wgreenhouse>	twb: more generally the old-timey term for dissident republicans
Feb 28 02:28:12 <johnjaye>	tabnine AI?
Feb 28 02:28:23 <grym>	not to be confused with newfangled term, which is "insurrectionist"
Feb 28 02:28:24 <JohnGalt>	its a AI completion system
Feb 28 02:28:33 <JohnGalt>	just hit tab and it writes code
Feb 28 02:28:40 <habamax>	nine times?
Feb 28 02:28:43 <grym>	gross
Feb 28 02:28:45 <johnjaye>	i had no idea the future was already here
Feb 28 02:28:53 <JohnGalt>	suprisingly good. Ive written entire test suites with one keystroke
Feb 28 02:29:03 <johnjaye>	isn't that literally what George Jetson was depicted doing? hitting the button all day at work?
Feb 28 02:29:18 <JohnGalt>	well you have to know if its the correct code
Feb 28 02:29:27 <twb>	wgreenhouse: I mean... dissident against what?  Aren't republicans just one half of the Wigs?
Feb 28 02:29:29 <JohnGalt>	but it saves enormous amounts of typing
Feb 28 02:29:31 <johnjaye>	i think that was someone else's job. he just hit the button
Feb 28 02:29:58 <JohnGalt>	I cant imagine java without it
Feb 28 02:30:23 <JohnGalt>	it writes entire format strings with about 90% accuracy
Feb 28 02:30:41 <twb>	"One nines accuracy", great job
Feb 28 02:30:47 <wgreenhouse>	twb: dissident republicans in the ira sense, I mean. people who wanted to continue the war with the uk
Feb 28 02:31:03 <JohnGalt>	twb: I think so
Feb 28 02:31:06 <twb>	wgreenhouse: oh right.  Sorry I thought you were speaking from a US context.
Feb 28 02:31:18 <JohnGalt>	since all it needs is a keystroke its pretty good
Feb 28 02:31:31 <habamax>	and a subscription
Feb 28 02:31:37 <JohnGalt>	and if it's showing wrong, you can nudge it with a bit of typing
Feb 28 02:31:42 <habamax>	or is it free now?
Feb 28 02:32:03 <JohnGalt>	subscription
Feb 28 02:32:13 <JohnGalt>	nobody is going to train a model for free
Feb 28 02:32:37 <JohnGalt>	the server, bandwith, and staffing is enormously expensive

Feb 29 01:31:52 <technomancy>	I was going with expanse gifs for a while
Feb 29 01:32:13 <bpalmer>	probably got too expansive to license, eh?
Feb 29 01:32:32 <technomancy>	lol
Feb 29 01:37:23 <mwnaylor>	git clone magit complete.
Feb 29 02:17:15 <grym>	but, magit clone magit
Feb 29 02:19:11 <grym>	i updated magit yesterday, more or less because i wanted to futz around with forge some more
Feb 29 02:20:59 <mwnaylor>	In my case, bash command.
Feb 29 02:22:17 <mwnaylor>	The old repo had a .git subdirectory, but magit did not recognize it as such. rm -r magit, then git clone url.
Feb 29 02:28:25 <Pacane>	Hi, I've got an emacs config that's working but I'm looking for some advice to improve it. Is this a proper place to get tips?
Feb 29 02:29:12 <grym>	sure
Feb 29 02:29:18 <kiliro>	yes, Pacane
Feb 29 02:29:45 <kiliro>	and the forums and the wiki and the manual
Feb 29 02:31:47 <Pacane>	I'm specifically looking for a way to organize my config in terms of dependencies. Right now I have a literal org config, using elpaca as my package manager. My issue is that I'm having trouble ordering/configuring stuff in the proper order. Everywhere I see samples they use "use-package" with a :config block. Is there a way to tell use-package (and probably elpaca) to configure stuff after having installed another
Feb 29 02:31:47 <Pacane>	package?
Feb 29 02:31:48 <fsbot>	[->] elpa is [0] the Emacs Lisp Package Archive, the default software repository for package.el the elisp package manager officially adopted for inclusion in gnu emacs 24 (distributes only free software) ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Feb 29 02:32:05 <grym>	Pacane: :after
Feb 29 02:33:55 <Pacane>	Can I put my use-package blocks in any order with this? assuming I put my :after blocs properly
Feb 29 02:34:24 <Pacane>	will elpaca be smart enough to process its install queue in the proper order?
Feb 29 02:35:45 <Pacane>	also, will :after A assume the :config block of A will have run?
Feb 29 02:35:59 <Pacane>	or will it just assume A is installed
Feb 29 02:36:28 <grym>	yes to the first; to the second: i don't know, read the use-package docs
Feb 29 02:36:42 <wgreenhouse>	Pacane: :config runs after the package named (or a library of the same name) is loaded
Feb 29 02:36:48 <wgreenhouse>	compare with :init
Feb 29 02:37:52 <wgreenhouse>	Pacane: you should probably read (info "(use-package) Loading sequentially") even though it is about use-package generally, and not specific to elpaca
Feb 29 02:38:12 <Pacane>	ok I will! thanks
Feb 29 02:42:54 <Pacane>	another question I had.. I've separated some of my config in multiple files to clean things up. However I'm having an issue where I don't have auto complete for function names from other packages I have "required" at the top of the file. Is there something to set up to get company or whatever else to pick up definitions of other elisp packages..?
Feb 29 02:43:43 <Pacane>	I can also not jump to definition and do such lsp'y things, is that not supported in some way in emacs for elisp?
Feb 29 02:44:37 <Pacane>	All I do, all the time is just describe functions and navigate there, but is there a way to, say for example jump to where a variable or function is declared?
Feb 29 02:46:20 <JohnGalt>	C - h v
Feb 29 02:46:27 <JohnGalt>	C - h f
Feb 29 02:46:40 <JohnGalt>	the sources are linked
Feb 29 02:48:24 <Pacane>	that's the thing though, sources aren't linked. I just get a message "Thing is declared in xyz.el"
Feb 29 02:48:47 <JohnGalt>	isn't there a underlined thing at the top of the doc?
Feb 29 02:48:59 <Pacane>	ok, right
Feb 29 02:49:28 <wgreenhouse>	Pacane: jump to definition is supported out of the box in elisp with M-.
Feb 29 02:49:29 <Pacane>	I think I recall seeing in doom emacs when I used that a while back, the actual source snippet was embedded in there
Feb 29 02:49:36 <Pacane>	any way to get that back?
Feb 29 02:50:03 <wgreenhouse>	there are a few projects that do things like that; any idea which package doom uses for that? :)
Feb 29 02:50:46 <Pacane>	I haven't looked at doom's source no
Feb 29 02:51:47 <Pacane>	I'm using evil and it remapped M-. I think I'll have to find the original function
Feb 29 02:52:58 <wgreenhouse>	it's `xref-find-definitions`
Feb 29 02:53:27 <Pacane>	it keeps saying "no definition found for X"
Feb 29 02:53:35 <wgreenhouse>	that means that library isn't loaded
Feb 29 02:53:36 <Pacane>	I believe I tried that before
Feb 29 02:53:42 <Pacane>	hmm
Feb 29 02:53:55 <wgreenhouse>	as in, the library defining the thing you tried it on
Feb 29 02:54:49 <wgreenhouse>	it can't look up the definition of something before the relevant file is loaded
Feb 29 02:54:59 <Pacane>	It's doing that even for core functions like load-theme
Feb 29 02:55:09 <wgreenhouse>	Pacane: ah, are you on Debian?
Feb 29 02:55:39 <wgreenhouse>	if so, elisp sources for the distribution are shipped in a separate package for $historical-reasons
Feb 29 02:55:41 <Pacane>	ahh no I think I know why.
Feb 29 02:55:45 <wgreenhouse>	you'll have to install those
Feb 29 02:56:04 <Pacane>	I'm on macos, but I think the issue it the fact that I'm doing that in a org config file
Feb 29 02:56:15 <Pacane>	in snippet blocks
Feb 29 02:56:22 <wgreenhouse>	"doing that" meaning what?
Feb 29 02:56:34 <Pacane>	xref-find-definitions
Feb 29 02:56:48 <wgreenhouse>	ah. yes, expand one of the snippets with C-c ' and do it there
Feb 29 02:57:00 <Pacane>	yeah I figured
Feb 29 02:57:01 <wgreenhouse>	try it in emacs-lisp-mode not org-mode
Feb 29 02:57:18 <Pacane>	I think I'm gonna ditch this literal org mode config
Feb 29 02:57:38 <Pacane>	it's mostly trouble compared to the upsides.
Feb 29 02:58:07 <wgreenhouse>	what is an emacs config but the opportunity to have uniquely terrible problems nobody else can relate to
Feb 29 02:58:11 <wgreenhouse>	,hell
Feb 29 02:58:12 <fsbot>	hell is other people's .emacs
Feb 29 02:59:04 <Pacane>	well I must be part of a bigger group, I've seen many tutorials building configs like this haha..
Feb 29 02:59:31 <wgreenhouse>	yeah, the org mode config is excellent for writing tutorials, or posts explaining your config
Feb 29 02:59:48 <wgreenhouse>	I've tried it a few times over the years but don't care enough to write good documentation of the config so it's pointless
Feb 29 03:00:36 <wgreenhouse>	now you've got me wondering if org itself is wired to use xref
Feb 29 03:00:45 <JohnGalt>	if it was hard to write it should be hard to read
Feb 29 03:01:31 <Pacane>	nice quote there
Feb 29 03:01:37 <wgreenhouse>	JohnGalt: at this stage, the point for me is more that config just shouldn't be permanent
Feb 29 03:01:41 <Pacane>	i'll reuse that for sure
Feb 29 03:01:53 <wgreenhouse>	doing emacs bankruptcy every couple years is wise
Feb 29 03:02:05 <wgreenhouse>	your workarounds might've become defaults meanwhile, etc.
Feb 29 03:02:08 <bpalmer>	Pacane: excellent. I strongly recommend people don't try to write "literate" configs.
Feb 29 03:02:25 <JohnGalt>	Im weeding stuff out of mine right now actually
Feb 29 03:02:35 <JohnGalt>	I have decades of stuff
Feb 29 03:03:09 <Pacane>	would it be nuts to just yeet the .org and use the generated .el? I means, it's literally all the same content except the org stuff, right?
Feb 29 03:03:25 <wgreenhouse>	wouldn't be nuts
Feb 29 03:05:51 <twb>	wgreenhouse: I think "every couple years" depends on how much you buy into "move fast and break things" in the first place
Feb 29 03:06:45 <wgreenhouse>	twb: very little to not at all
Feb 29 03:08:19 <Pacane>	is there a recommeded place to put your config, or do you just shove it in init.el?
Feb 29 03:08:47 <JohnGalt>	I think .emacs.d is the new way
Feb 29 03:08:53 <grym>	i put mine in ~/.emacs.d/init.el
Feb 29 03:09:02 <grym>	that's the old new way, but i like it more than the new new way
Feb 29 03:09:29 <Pacane>	but init.el loads whatever other file in .emacs.d?
Feb 29 03:09:30 <JohnGalt>	I symlink .emacs -> ~/code/grail/emacs/grail.el
Feb 29 03:09:36 <JohnGalt>	which is my entry point
Feb 29 03:10:29 <grym>	Pacane: it does what it's told
Feb 29 03:11:38 <offby1>	I think my previous trouble with helm is this https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/2623
Feb 29 03:11:47 <Pacane>	yeah I know that, but I assume putting everything in init.el is not the best if I want my config in source control..? because of all the custom stuff that gets added at the bottom?
Feb 29 03:14:31 <JohnGalt>	you can define a customization file
Feb 29 03:14:52 <JohnGalt>	seperate from your init
Feb 29 03:14:59 <Pacane>	oh didn't know about that!
Feb 29 03:15:00 <grym>	Pacane: do you mean using m-x customize, or something else
Feb 29 03:15:22 <Pacane>	grym: yes
Feb 29 03:15:39 <Pacane>	and stuff like unsafe themes when you try something out
Feb 29 03:15:43 <grym>	Pacane: true/false answers to or questions are confusing
Feb 29 03:16:09 <Pacane>	yes customize
Feb 29 03:16:14 <bpalmer>	Pacane: I set custom-file to be ~/.emacs.d/custom.el
Feb 29 03:16:45 <grym>	ah.  i don't use customize, so i can't help there
Feb 29 03:16:52 <bpalmer>	that said, there's no problem in using a single source file evne with source contorl
Feb 29 03:17:01 <bpalmer>	just make sure to commit your changes after you customize them.
Feb 29 03:17:05 <Pacane>	I think bpalmer's solution is good for me though
Feb 29 03:22:59 <bpalmer>	hmm. Somewhere on the 'moving fast'and breaking things axis: 'I think like once per day about how a French citizen punched Emmanuel Macron in the face, and all within 48 hours was arrested, charged, tried, convicted, and sentenced to 4 months in jail' (contrast that with US legal system)
Feb 29 03:24:36 <habamax>	Is there a case an average Joe punched US president in the face and stayed alive?
Feb 29 03:24:51 <bpalmer>	someone threw a shoe at a press conference and lived.
Feb 29 03:25:36 <bpalmer>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_shoeing_incident : the person who threw the shoe spent 9 months in prison.
Feb 29 03:25:37 <habamax>	I wonder if it was rep us president or liberal?
Feb 29 03:25:40 <grym>	habamax: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Schrank
Feb 29 03:26:01 <grym>	he shot teddy in the chest and they both lived...
Feb 29 03:26:18 <grym>	(teddy went on to give a 2 hour speech)
Feb 29 03:26:34 <twb>	bpalmer: shoe = "assault with a deadly weapon", MQ-9 missiles = "self-defense"
Feb 29 03:26:39 <bpalmer>	(to be fair, I think punching someone is usually more dangerous than throwing a normal shoe)
Feb 29 03:27:01 <grym>	shoe throwing is mostly "i intend to be as insulting as humanly possible"
Feb 29 03:27:06 <grym>	not "i intend physical harm"
Feb 29 03:27:49 <bpalmer>	On the other hand, if James Bond films are to be believed, throwing hats...
Feb 29 03:27:56 <grym>	shooting someone with a .38 ...
Feb 29 03:28:02 <grym>	very special hats only please
Feb 29 03:28:12 <habamax>	fedora
Feb 29 03:28:31 <grym>	the prop was made by a very famous hatter
Feb 29 03:28:44 <grym>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddjob#Oddjob's_hat
Feb 29 03:29:09 <bpalmer>	in the novel, he wore a Bowler; in the film, a Sandringham hag
Feb 29 03:29:10 <bpalmer>	hat
Feb 29 03:31:42 <bpalmer>	Hmm. That's what at least https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/Razor-Rimmed_Hat claims, but it looks like a bowler to me.
Feb 29 03:32:15 <bremner>	hag would have been a more interesting film. Witches of whitehall
Feb 29 03:32:52 <twb>	The fact that YOU can't tell a miner's hat from a cowboy's hat doesn't stop them being different
Feb 29 03:33:15 <bremner>	ok, but tell us more about your cowboy hag
Feb 29 03:36:09 <twb>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler_hat#cite_ref-10
Feb 29 03:38:22 <bpalmer>	Yeah, and meanwhile, although pages turn up for "Sandringham hat", none of them identify it as an actual hat style.
Feb 29 03:41:00 <bremner>	surprised noone mentioned Peaky Blinders
Feb 29 03:56:55 <bpalmer>	I'll get to that right after Treme
Feb 29 04:00:41 <twb>	Who's she?
Feb 29 04:01:20 <bpalmer>	Treme is a television show.
Feb 29 04:02:13 <bpalmer>	Like Peaky Blinders, it was critically acclaimed; it was at one time a standin for television that people meant to get to but would keep putting off.
Feb 29 04:16:47 <Pacane>	Alright, job is "done". I ditched that literate config. Thanks everyone who helped me.
Feb 29 04:17:04 <Pacane>	Still not perfect, but things are working OK now!
Feb 29 04:21:19 <twb>	So going back to the JWT bullshit from the other day... does JWT actually support asymmetric crypto?  The only required algorithm is HMAC, but I see optional EcDSA there as well (but not ed22519).
Feb 29 04:22:49 <twb>	The library I'm looking at doesn't give any examples except for HS256: https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jws/index.html
Feb 29 04:39:53 <bpalmer>	Apple TV+ has ordered an adaptation of William Gibson's "Neuromancer"
Feb 29 04:45:16 <mns>	they could pull it off too
Feb 29 04:46:19 <bpalmer>	 it's certainly one of the more exciting adaptation news I've heard in a while.
Feb 29 04:48:01 <twb>	You wouldn't prefer, like, Mieville?
Feb 29 04:48:32 <bpalmer>	... The City & The City , maybe.
Feb 29 04:48:56 <bpalmer>	Certainly not Perdido Street Station or The Last Days of New Paris
Feb 29 04:49:21 <bpalmer>	Hmm... actually, I take that back. I'd *love* to see how they try to adapt The Last Days of New Paris.
Feb 29 04:50:10 <bpalmer>	maybe it wouldn't be hard if it was animated.
Feb 29 04:53:59 <spikemaster>	does adding comment blocks count as literate programming?
Feb 29 05:02:01 <twb>	Does "public key in PEM format" not exist as a concept?
Feb 29 05:02:25 <twb>	"certtool --generate-privkey --type ecdsa --outfile=foo.pem" works but I can't see any way to make *just* the pubkey.
Feb 29 05:02:39 <twb>	"ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -m PEM -f foo.pem" works but the foo.pem.pub isn't PEM
Feb 29 05:03:20 <twb>	Reading it back in also doesn't DWIM: "ssh-keygen -y -f foo.pem -m PEM"
Feb 29 05:03:55 <twb>	My ultimate goal is to be have two principals: one that knows the private key and generates a JWT, and one that knows only the public key and verifies a JWT

Feb 29 06:50:19 <JohnGalt>	I think I was noticing significantly different behavior with source vs compiled. A lot more warnings. Is there a doc on how the compiler can miscompile stuff?

Feb 29 07:38:22 <amirny2205>	hi everyone, I still didn't solve a problem of indents in web-mode. I have activated this https://dpaste.org/xW1yv but when I do C-x h then indent-region, it does indent it with 4 spaces everywhere, when I do tab on a line, it sets line indentation to 2 spaces. What am I understanding wrong? thanks
Feb 29 07:38:24 <amirny2205>	I need 2 spaces everywhere as an indent
Feb 29 07:42:18 <twb>	setq-default looks wrong there
Feb 29 07:42:24 <twb>	You should use setq most of the time
Feb 29 07:42:40 <twb>	amirny2205: have you looked in M-x customize-group RET web-mode RET ?
Feb 29 07:42:52 <twb>	That gives you a GUI to configure all the settings
Feb 29 07:43:15 <amirny2205>	sure, didn't find anything useful. Wait I'll try setq
Feb 29 07:43:36 <amirny2205>	setq doesn't word either
Feb 29 07:44:09 <twb>	setq-default is kinda like a "force" mode for setq, it setq even harder
Feb 29 07:44:39 <twb>	It looks like web-mode is a third-party thing, and ICBF installing it to investigate for you

Feb 29 07:50:05 <notzmv>	hıo ka
Feb 29 07:50:27 <notzmv>	I can't believe I had sly-autodoc-mode off this whole time
Feb 29 09:58:48 <sandra>	The other day I had a string= that borked my init since it tried to compare to a null and I couldn't find it, even --debug-init didn't give a stack trace.
Feb 29 09:58:48 <sandra>	After some futile half-hearted attempts at bisecting, I found out about (toggle-debug-on-error) which saved the day.
Feb 29 09:58:48 <sandra>	I also mentioned that I should put my .emacs.d under git control. Turns out I actually had done that but it was so long ago and so un-updated. I had used the weird "nonstandard .git dir" thing.
Feb 29 09:58:48 <sandra>	Magit can't handle that so I wrote up a solution at https://idiomdrottning.org/cfgmagit and now all is peachy keen in the world (if I could only learn to remember to save changes in there).
Feb 29 10:04:10 <sandra>	Oh yeah I forgot to complain about what had caused the string= NPE in the first place!
Feb 29 10:04:10 <sandra>	I was comparing a string to (file-name-extension buffer-file-name). Turns out that that borks if buffer-file-name is nil (like in the scratch buffer).
Feb 29 10:04:10 <sandra>	But then guard-and-ing it still doesn't help because file-name-extension in turn can also return nil if there is a file name and no extension!
Feb 29 10:04:10 <sandra>	So I needed (and buffer-file-name (file-name-extension buffer-file-name) (…my comparison to (file-name-extension buffer-file-name) goes here…)) to fix things. Yikes. I'm not sure even a git-aided undo history would've found that easily, but toggle-debug-on-error did.
Feb 29 10:13:28 <sandra>	Maybe if I make a cron script to save all tracked files five times per day (hair so high it starts to sway). Then I "only" need to remember to add files
Feb 29 10:17:26 <sandra>	23 5-22/3 * * * config-save #"At minute 23 past every 3rd hour from 5 through 22."
Feb 29 10:19:58 <sandra>	Now if I've been diligent nothing will get autocommitted, it's only there to catch things I miss. Provided, again, that I also then actually add the files.
Feb 29 10:20:23 <sandra>	Neat thing about this config alias is that it works even when I'm not in the home dir

Feb 29 12:36:08 <amirny2205>	who uses what for web-development? I need support for html, js, css   thank you
Feb 29 12:36:48 <amirny2205>	web-mode is buggy
Feb 29 12:44:52 <jbe>	I don't really do much of that, but web-mode I assume comes with compromises as html, js, css, what-have-you are pretty different in syntax and still need to somehow coexist. if there are any specific things you experience as bugs, maybe you could describe those in more detail and perhaps people can help you with a solution
Feb 29 12:45:36 <jrx>	! what's the best way to do web development with Emacs ? what's the best major mode for editing HTML, CSS and JavaScript at the same time?
Feb 29 12:45:38 <fsbot>	🤖[g] For web development with Emacs, you can use the web-mode package, which provides a major mode for editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript simultaneously, offering syntax highlighting and indentation for each language. It's a versatile and efficient option for working on web projects!
Feb 29 12:46:02 <amirny2205>	thanks
Feb 29 12:47:10 <pkal>	amirny2205: I just use mhtml-mode, the regular css-mode and js-mode.  I think that js2-mode on ELPA has some interesting things, but I don't know too much about that.
Feb 29 12:47:49 <pkal>	To be fair, I am not a web developer in any contemporary sense of the term.
Feb 29 12:48:20 <jrx>	amirny2205: maybe try this https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-html/
Feb 29 12:48:52 <jrx>	and this https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-css/
Feb 29 12:48:54 <amirny2205>	thanks a lot jrx pkal!
Feb 29 12:49:32 <pkal>	jrx: what does a CSS LSP-Server provide?
Feb 29 12:50:25 <jrx>	pkal: https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/#overview
Feb 29 12:52:21 <pkal>	jrx: that's the LSP client
Feb 29 12:52:54 <pkal>	what I meant was this https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/css-language-features/server
Feb 29 12:53:20 <pkal>	the site is just not that good at explaining what it does (css-mode e.g. has completion already built-in)
Feb 29 13:00:54 <jrx>	this file may help understand a few completions offered by vscode css LSP server : https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/extensions/css-language-features/server/src/test/completion.test.ts

Feb 29 13:20:54 <Miroboru>	I am having some emacs issues that I am trying to get to the bottom of (I won't bother you with the details for now). I am trying to start with a fresh install of Doom emacs, so I am deleting .config/doom and .config/emacs before a new git clone and install. Is there more to it than this?
Feb 29 13:21:26 <Miroboru>	My main issue is that Doom emacs is running fine on a second machine with the same versions of emacs, doom and config files...
Feb 29 13:21:56 <Miroboru>	So I am wondering if there can be something else in my environment that is triggering this behaviour
Feb 29 13:22:51 <Miroboru>	I am running the fish shell, but I have now swichted to zsh and relogged, so I think that should be fine for now
Feb 29 13:25:28 <Miroboru>	An example of the problem I have is that if I try to do eg. 'C-h f', I get the error 'byte-code: Invalig read syntax: ")"'
Feb 29 13:25:58 <Miroboru>	This is with a totally clean install, no config files other than the default ones
Feb 29 13:26:33 <kiliro>	list the differences between the 2 systems...including operating system and other installed programs and libraries
Feb 29 13:26:41 <Miroboru>	If I try to open a cpp file I get: 'File mode specification error: (invalid-read-syntax ))'
Feb 29 13:26:48 <kiliro>	that will show you what could be the problem
Feb 29 13:26:51 <grym>	more on M-X, from yesterday: https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/EmacsMetaXRelevantCommands
Feb 29 13:29:28 <Miroboru>	kiliro: The systems are both running Arch, although one of them was updated 9 days ago, while the non-working one was updated yesterday...
Feb 29 13:29:38 <Miroboru>	They are otherwise identical
Feb 29 13:30:27 <kiliro>	update the old one
Feb 29 13:30:36 <nofuture>	Must be gremlins.
Feb 29 13:30:36 <kiliro>	and see if it gives the same error
Feb 29 13:30:54 <kiliro>	if it does not, there is something else wrong
Feb 29 13:31:02 <nofuture>	One or two bits went astray, etc.
Feb 29 13:31:17 <nofuture>	Cosmic rays and such.
Feb 29 13:31:17 <kiliro>	could it be hardware? have you searched the web for that error message?
Feb 29 13:31:38 <nofuture>	Neutrinos.
Feb 29 13:31:40 <Miroboru>	kiliro: Yeah, I get what you are saying, I'm just afraid I'll end up with two non-working systems instead... But there is really no other way I guess...
Feb 29 13:32:10 <Miroboru>	kiliro: There are some tangential hits, but nothing really close. Nothing on the Doom discord either really
Feb 29 13:32:18 <nofuture>	I'm just waiting for the next Carrington Event, honestly.
Feb 29 13:32:30 <Miroboru>	kiliro: kk, I'll update machine two then
Feb 29 13:32:31 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: the web is full of error messages
Feb 29 13:32:31 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: XMPP + Biboumi, and recently the XMPP-Matrix bridge for this one room which is full of Matrixheads who are constantly sending multiline messages which get sent as web links to the bridged IRC room...
Feb 29 13:32:40 <kiliro>	does it work with emacs -q ?
Feb 29 13:33:08 <Miroboru>	kiliro: lemme check
Feb 29 13:33:21 <kiliro>	if it does work, the problem is with your config
Feb 29 13:33:27 <Miroboru>	Yes, that is working
Feb 29 13:33:30 <kiliro>	isect
Feb 29 13:33:36 <kiliro>	,bisect
Feb 29 13:33:36 <fsbot>	bisect is [0/4] If your problem disappears when you run emacs -q, the problem resides in your init-file (see ,init-file)
Feb 29 13:33:36 <fsbot>	[1] Bisection is a technique used to debug a problematic init file by commenting out half the file and running emacs. If the problem persists, you know that it is in the un-commented part of your init file. Comment or uncomment half of the remaining code and re-run emacs; recurse as needed. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]

Feb 29 13:34:01 <Miroboru>	kiliro: Well, I have already thrown out all my configs and installed a totally virgin Doom
Feb 29 13:34:11 <kiliro>	,init-file
Feb 29 13:34:12 <fsbot>	kiliro: [->] InitFile: [0] from (info "(emacs)Init File"), "Emacs looks for your init file using the filenames `~/.emacs', `~/.emacs.el', or `~/.emacs.d/init.el'" in that order, using only the first one that it finds. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Feb 29 13:34:16 <Miroboru>	kiliro: But there may be something with the default doom config ofc
Feb 29 13:34:43 <kiliro>	I don't like doomç
Feb 29 13:34:51 <Miroboru>	kiliro: yeah, I dot rid of everything in ~/ long time ago. Everything is in .config
Feb 29 13:34:53 <kiliro>	I would rather make the changes myself
Feb 29 13:35:32 <nofuture>	Beryllium bronze can solve a lot of problems.
Feb 29 13:35:33 <kiliro>	I only work in .emacs and .authinfo
Feb 29 13:35:44 <Miroboru>	kiliro: I get you, but Doom has a lot of quite sane defaults for a lot of packages, and if you are a evil user like me it saves you a lot of work - when it works ;)
Feb 29 13:36:16 <kiliro>	don't be evil!  LOL  I use devil
Feb 29 13:36:41 <kiliro>	and gives you a lot of work when it does not work
Feb 29 13:37:18 <kiliro>	just bisect and find the error
Feb 29 13:37:51 <Miroboru>	kiliro: I'll upgrade the second machine to get that uncertainty out of the way first...
Feb 29 13:38:12 <kiliro>	don't update the doom
Feb 29 13:38:25 <kiliro>	even if they are currently equal
Feb 29 13:38:31 <Miroboru>	Doom the two machines are identical right now
Feb 29 13:38:42 <Miroboru>	So that is not the issue
Feb 29 13:38:51 <kiliro>	so you can test if there are differences in the same versions
Feb 29 13:39:10 <kiliro>	the world is not perfect
Feb 29 13:39:23 <kiliro>	especially the more functionality you add
Feb 29 13:39:25 <Miroboru>	Doom is being updated outside of pacman so that is no problem. I do those updates manually
Feb 29 13:39:49 <kiliro>	most things are not reproducible
Feb 29 13:39:55 <kiliro>	only relatively equal

Feb 29 14:23:27 <catern>	HMMM
Feb 29 14:23:41 <catern>	how am I supposed to handle files named ~ correctly?
Feb 29 14:24:12 <catern>	a simple loop over directory-files in default-directory will see that as an absolute path
Feb 29 14:26:59 <dminuoso>	As opposed to what, catern?
Feb 29 14:27:21 <catern>	dminuoso: a relative path to a file in the current directory named "~"
Feb 29 14:27:41 <dminuoso>	catern: Okay, so what does your loop do exactly?
Feb 29 14:27:58 <catern>	try it yourself, make a file named ~ and then do (dolist (file (directory-files ".")) (when (file-directory-p file) (message "directory? %s" file)))
Feb 29 14:27:59 <dminuoso>	The function you stuff it into is the one that (presumably) does shell-like expansion of ~
Feb 29 14:28:23 <catern>	all emacs filename functions do shell-like expansion of ~
Feb 29 14:32:28 <dminuoso>	catern: According to documentation at least that shouldnt be true, as 26.9.4 lists (apparently not all) functions that expand filenames.
Feb 29 14:33:53 <catern>	dminuoso: no, you're wrong, please show literally any example of a file name function which doesn't expand ~
Feb 29 14:34:01 <catern>	note also the docstring of file-name-absolute-p
Feb 29 14:34:14 <catern>	"A file name is considered to be absolute if its first component is ‘~’"
Feb 29 14:36:43 <dminuoso>	catern: Not quite sure how that proves wrong what I just said.
Feb 29 14:36:46 <dminuoso>	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/File-Name-Expansion.html
Feb 29 14:36:54 <dminuoso>	Im not suggesting that this is correct, just that its what the manual is hinting at.
Feb 29 14:37:17 <catern>	all file name functions expand ~
Feb 29 14:37:45 <catern>	dminuoso: note that that manual page says "Expanding a file name means converting a relative file name to an absolute one.", and according to Emacs, "~" is already absolute
Feb 29 14:38:08 <catern>	does that make sense?

Feb 29 15:18:59 <wgreenhouse>	catern: tried this?
Feb 29 15:18:59 <wgreenhouse>	> If you do not want this expansion for a relative FILENAME that might begin with a literal ‘~’, you can use ‘(concat (file-name-as-directory directory) filename)’ instead of ‘(expand-file-name filename directory)’.
Feb 29 15:20:44 <catern>	wgreenhouse: well, just to repeat, this is not an issue specific to expand-file-name
Feb 29 15:21:10 <catern>	but yes, currently I'm just using absolute paths everywhere and avoiding using relative paths ever
Feb 29 15:21:37 <catern>	which is a bit sad because it means I can't operate relative to default-directory, which is convenient
Feb 29 15:29:37 <rpav>	_why_ are you using absolute paths everywhere?
Feb 29 15:29:59 <JohnGalt>	catern: that is not portable
Feb 29 15:30:25 <catern>	rpav: scroll up? I just explained why
Feb 29 15:30:36 <catern>	(because of the "file named ~" issue)
Feb 29 15:30:42 <JohnGalt>	irc doesnt have history
Feb 29 15:30:59 <rpav>	oh
Feb 29 15:31:05 <rpav>	catern: ./~ :p
Feb 29 15:31:12 <catern>	yeah
Feb 29 15:31:18 <rpav>	which looks like an 8th note, but ;)
Feb 29 15:31:35 <JohnGalt>	you name your files wiht
Feb 29 15:31:39 <JohnGalt>	with ~ ?
Feb 29 15:31:45 <catern>	rpav: but then I have to concat that in front of directory-files output everywhere all the time
Feb 29 15:32:57 <grym>	,drdr
Feb 29 15:32:58 <fsbot>	"Doctor! Doctor! It hurts when I do <this>!"
Feb 29 15:32:58 <fsbot>	"Well, don't do <that>, then!"
Feb 29 15:34:07 <rpav>	catern: that seems to be the prudent/safe thing to do, i.e. explicitly-relative path
Feb 29 15:34:56 <rpav>	or alternatively you could write escape-file-name which checks if it's ~
Feb 29 15:35:33 <JohnGalt>	~ should always mean home directory
Feb 29 15:35:44 <rpav>	JohnGalt: nothing always
Feb 29 15:36:12 <rpav>	`touch ~` .. ~ is a shell convention and imo emacs should probably not expand that implicitly, but it does
Feb 29 15:36:37 <JohnGalt>	I use nothing but shell conventions
Feb 29 15:36:45 <JohnGalt>	that is the heart of UNIX
Feb 29 15:36:46 <catern>	rpav: I agree it's prudent but afaict zero code in Emacs does it
Feb 29 15:37:08 <catern>	this is all coming from someone complaining to me that making a file named ~ made eglot break hard
Feb 29 15:37:37 <rpav>	oof, imagine `mkdir '~'`
Feb 29 15:37:44 <rpav>	someone's just like rm -rf
Feb 29 15:37:46 <rpav>	D:
Feb 29 15:38:00 <grym>	just because you _can_ doesn't mean you _ought_, and oh boy does the "pathological file naming" game fall under that rule
Feb 29 15:38:06 <rpav>	catern: dired handles it just fine; maybe see how that works
Feb 29 15:38:19 <grym>	dired is remarkably good at removing horribly named files, indeed
Feb 29 15:38:36 <grym>	so much so that i've used it to win that game a few times :P
Feb 29 15:38:51 <JohnGalt>	I dont name my files '/' or '~' , thats dumb
Feb 29 15:38:51 <rpav>	dired should _probably_ be considered a canonical (if not good? i haven't seen the code) for how to do file manip
Feb 29 15:39:13 <dutchie>	'/' is actually a forbidden character in (Linux) filenames though
Feb 29 15:39:17 <dutchie>	no nulls either
Feb 29 15:39:42 <grym>	dutchie: and those are the exact two things you can't do!
Feb 29 15:39:45 <cehteh>	in posix only / and null are forbidden
Feb 29 15:39:49 <grym>	there's lots you _shouldn't_ do
Feb 29 15:40:12 <cehteh>	actual filesystems and implementations may constrain this a bit more
Feb 29 15:40:20 <grym>	they nearly always do, yes
Feb 29 15:40:27 <grym>	just in which ways varies
Feb 29 15:40:28 <catern>	rpav: good suggestion, dired seems to first call (dired-get-filename) which returns an absolute path
Feb 29 15:40:35 <cehteh>	most evil are newlines in filenames :D
Feb 29 15:40:47 <grym>	cehteh: or things like > or |
Feb 29 15:40:56 <JohnGalt>	in DOS you can do 8 bit characters on the num pad
Feb 29 15:40:56 <grym>	or --
Feb 29 15:41:07 <JohnGalt>	like <alt> 255 for blank
Feb 29 15:41:14 <cehteh>	grym: those are at least visible
Feb 29 15:41:23 <grym>	cehteh: nbsp :)
Feb 29 15:41:37 <dutchie>	newline in filenames is a good one to break stuff
Feb 29 15:41:50 <cehteh>	.o( touch '-rf *' )
Feb 29 15:41:56 <dutchie>	also invalid utf-8
Feb 29 15:42:15 <catern>	aha!
Feb 29 15:42:16 <cehteh>	thats pretty common

Feb 29 16:03:18 <JohnGalt>	Im trying to set the font size e.g: 200 but I dont think its working because the font is built in 12x24 etc...
Feb 29 16:03:38 <JohnGalt>	is there an alternate font spec syntax for fixed size fonts?
Feb 29 16:17:15 <vuori>	I think you can use the X11 LFD-style font specs in most places?
Feb 29 16:26:15 <wgreenhouse>	yes, emacs accepts both truetype-style names and LFD-style names for instance

Feb 29 16:37:13 <rpav>	i.e. like you probably just did ;)
Feb 29 16:37:25 <JohnGalt>	yeah i did
Feb 29 16:37:26 <dminuoso>	JohnGalt: This is mostly a matter of your font engine.
Feb 29 16:37:53 <JohnGalt>	MacOS is fantastic and install is just a copy to ~/Library/Fonts
Feb 29 16:38:08 <JohnGalt>	you dont have to go through FontBook anymore
Feb 29 16:38:18 <rpav>	ah they also (should?!) have proper engine configs for all their hardware so that cuts that out
Feb 29 16:38:32 <vuori>	There are a couple of monospace/coding font sites that let you try out various fonts, but the final narrowing down really requires picking a few candidates and using them in real life for a while
Feb 29 16:38:36 <rpav>	though i guess you can plug in whatever monitor you want to some
Feb 29 16:38:51 <JohnGalt>	yeah, I'll check it out
Feb 29 16:38:51 <rpav>	i would bet they're pretty good about detecting stuff though
Feb 29 16:39:19 <JohnGalt>	Everything is fully integrated, but the XDR Pro has had some nasty corner cases
Feb 29 16:39:28 <rpav>	vuori: it really does.. i have a (huge, ever-growing..) font function where i test out new ones
Feb 29 16:39:30 <JohnGalt>	I wish it had a factory reset, or any button at all
Feb 29 16:39:33 <vuori>	I did a big round of comparisons a year or two ago and ended up with Cousine
Feb 29 16:39:49 <JohnGalt>	vuori: interesting
Feb 29 16:39:56 <rpav>	`;; {} () 0OijIl!1 <> mn g9qCGQ ~-+*=>` near the top
Feb 29 16:40:34 <JohnGalt>	Cousine looks super slick
Feb 29 16:40:47 <rpav>	cousine is liberation sans and yeah .. i've had a _lot_ of luck with that
Feb 29 16:40:55 <rpav>	"cross-platform"
Feb 29 16:41:12 <dminuoso>	JohnGalt: At any rate, for a font to really shine you need not only a good display, your font need appropriate hinting, your font engine needs to have good sub pixel/HiDPI algorithms, and your font engine needs to have accurate knowledge of your displays subpixel layouts.
Feb 29 16:41:37 <dminuoso>	JohnGalt: In a way Apple has a key advantage, in that by default all these things are controlled - so you get a good experience out of the box.
Feb 29 16:42:09 <rpav>	it's not terminus-crisp but it's pretty crisp at 2k on most of my gear.. i think i use something else on the laptop in 4k
Feb 29 16:42:38 <vuori>	Quite a few people seem to like the typewriter/Courier descended curvy/serif look, but I've found those too distracting and prefer the sans-serif DEC/misc-fixed/Terminus school
Feb 29 16:43:04 <dminuoso>	Though Apple Quartz actually just ignores font hints altogether, since if you have a high enough DPI to run HiDPI its better to just alias (or not!)
Feb 29 16:43:20 <rpav>	i primarily want crisp and good distinguishable glyphs
Feb 29 16:43:47 <dminuoso>	My favourite font by far is PragmataPro.
Feb 29 16:43:53 <rpav>	but also big enough to be readable yet small enough to get a lot of columns/rows
Feb 29 16:44:03 <dminuoso>	rpav: Take a look at that font, maybe.
Feb 29 16:44:19 <rpav>	dminuoso: yeah i don't think i've tested that
Feb 29 16:44:23 <JohnGalt>	Yeah, having a walled garden is nice sometimes if you drink all the kool-aid
Feb 29 16:44:25 <rpav>	unless it's the $$ one in which case haha no
Feb 29 16:44:44 <dminuoso>	rpav: It is, consider buying it on black friday - you usually get a 40% coupon then.
Feb 29 16:44:45 <JohnGalt>	I can set all the res, and go LowDPI or HighDPI
Feb 29 16:44:55 <dminuoso>	rpav: Though if you look at that font, you might understand why the author charges money for it.
Feb 29 16:45:04 <rpav>	eh
Feb 29 16:45:13 <dminuoso>	He spent so many hours hand crafting each glyph at most font sizes...
Feb 29 16:45:16 <rpav>	dminuoso: not really, it's pretty average
Feb 29 16:45:43 <rpav>	way way too big in the examples
Feb 29 16:45:59 <JohnGalt>	wow, Cousine is really good
Feb 29 16:46:28 <JohnGalt>	Unfortunately LowDPI isnt handled well by the system, HighDPI is way more usable
Feb 29 16:48:03 <JohnGalt>	wow 4k is really low DPI
Feb 29 16:48:25 <rpav>	if i can't test the font i wouldn't even consider it .. there should be a free trial version with at least enough basic glyphs to test in the editor before committing to the full thing
Feb 29 16:48:34 <dminuoso>	rpav: Horizontally its rather dense. A lot of work went into symbols and ligatures. Give the Haskell examples a look - its what convinced me.
Feb 29 16:48:41 <dminuoso>	Text is somewhat average I agree.
Feb 29 16:48:56 <rpav>	dminuoso: yeah i also don't do the ligature thing
Feb 29 16:49:34 <dminuoso>	Yeah thats fair.
Feb 29 16:51:53 <bjorkint0sh>	what's up with package refresh getting stuck on elpa.gnu
Feb 29 16:51:58 <bjorkint0sh>	sometimes it works just fine
Feb 29 16:52:13 <bjorkint0sh>	other times ... which I can't fathom why, it just does nothing.
Feb 29 16:56:19 <bjorkint0sh>	https://elpa.gnu.org/ the website is there, clearly. why does package get stuck?
Feb 29 16:57:37 <rpav>	liberation-12px is about as horizontally efficient as iosevka-13px but more vertically efficient.. and more readable/crisper here
Feb 29 17:04:45 <JohnGalt>	I think Im going to stick with Cousine , LowDPI, and 24 pt, or some such scaling
Feb 29 17:05:18 <JohnGalt>	In a very Un-Apple situation it doesnt scale apps automatically, you have to tweak the fonts one app at a time
Feb 29 17:07:28 <JohnGalt>	I cant believe how much it sucks to need reading glasses
Feb 29 17:07:53 <JohnGalt>	I always thought they were silly, now the jokes on me :[
Feb 29 17:09:42 <rpav>	yea ;/
Feb 29 17:10:01 <rpav>	i might go for far / computer / reading but not sure yet
Feb 29 17:10:13 <grym>	it's just weakness!! train your eyes!!
Feb 29 17:10:13 <bjorkint0sh>	JohnGalt, reading glasses are fantastic. they're your friend.
Feb 29 17:10:17 <rpav>	i can read ok with computer glasses
Feb 29 17:10:28 <bjorkint0sh>	i've got about 7 of them right here from the dollar store.
Feb 29 17:10:34 <JohnGalt>	bjorkint0sh: thanks!
Feb 29 17:11:30 <grym>	hmm. i should start shooting more, get dialed in to looking out to 40+ yards
Feb 29 17:11:43 <grym>	(shooting a bow, i should be clear, where 40 yards is fairly far)
Feb 29 17:12:01 <bjorkint0sh>	bow?

Feb 29 17:12:38 <bjorkint0sh>	yeah but what are we? in some modern era here? let's not kid ourselves!
Feb 29 17:12:57 <grym>	my bows are distinctly non-modern, indeed
Feb 29 17:13:29 <nofuture>	2024 is just 1424 with more modcons.
Feb 29 17:13:40 <grym>	ew, 15th c.
Feb 29 17:13:59 <grym>	so modern
Feb 29 17:15:52 <nofuture>	Sometimes it seems like we learn nothing.  =P
Feb 29 17:16:55 <Inline>	?
Feb 29 17:17:41 <bjorkint0sh>	Though. Given that glass making was a very well developed trade by 1 BCE, I wonder why we never see roman era mosaics of people wearing spectacles.
Feb 29 17:17:47 <JohnGalt>	I find few like minds that love to learn
Feb 29 17:17:48 <kiliro>	getting numbers inside of boxes that means that I have some missing font in my operating system?
Feb 29 17:18:03 <JohnGalt>	kiliro: missing glyphs
Feb 29 17:18:12 <JohnGalt>	kiliro: you need a better font

Feb 29 17:19:44 <grym>	bjorkint0sh: took a while for grinding to catch up
Feb 29 17:19:48 <grym>	bjorkint0sh: http://www.larsdatter.com/eyeglasses.htm
Feb 29 17:19:55 <roadie>	I watched the steveys tech talk emergency emacs and typed his show-kill-ring.el from the screen. Then I fixed the typos but it complained and would not run (incf and so on) - then I gave it to GPT4 and it rewrote it using pure elisp and best practices and ... it now runs beautifully.
Feb 29 17:20:07 <corwin>	Anyway, the "boxes" with the character id inside are those for which you have no glyph, currently. Emacs will opportunisticly load glyphs missing from your default/current font from others found on your system; just install more system fonts, typically, to "fix".
Feb 29 17:20:40 <bjorkint0sh>	grym, good point.
Feb 29 17:39:09 <roadie>	https://termbin.com/zh30
Feb 29 18:12:44 <yezariaely>	I have a shell script with which I update a file currently loaded in emacs. Now in this shell script I would like to reload the buffer in the running emacs session. I know that emacsclient exists, could you give me some guidance on how to achieve that? I tried emacsclient -e "(revert-buffer :ignore-auto :noconfirm)" but this resulted in *ERROR*: Buffer does not seem to be associated with any file
Feb 29 18:22:10 <pkal>	yezariaely: the question is what the context-buffer is that the expression is being evaluated in
Feb 29 18:24:57 <wgreenhouse>	likely it's beibg evaluated at `initial-buffer-choice` (i.e. *scratch*) and not in the buffer you want
Feb 29 18:25:34 <wgreenhouse>	yezariaely: a less annoying approach may be to enable auto-revert-mode for the relevant buffer
Feb 29 18:25:59 <wgreenhouse>	this uses efficient OS-based methods (e.g. inotify in linux) to detect file changes
Feb 29 18:26:11 <grym>	auto-revert-mode is great
Feb 29 18:26:21 <wgreenhouse>	should work at least as well as forcing emacs to poll after the script makes a change to the file
Feb 29 18:35:21 <yezariaely>	wgreenhouse: ah, I will look into that. That sounds like a better approach. Because I will never write in that buffer in emacs, just and only from the shell script.
Feb 29 18:41:08 <johnjaye>	hot take: was there ever benchmarks performed on realistic workloads to determine if emacs native comp is faster in practice?
Feb 29 18:41:22 <grym>	that's not a hot take
Feb 29 18:41:31 <johnjaye>	the arxiv paper I found on it said speedups varied from 2x to 42x on selected tasks
Feb 29 18:41:42 <johnjaye>	grym: it is if the answer is no
Feb 29 18:41:51 <grym>	johnjaye: hot takes aren't questions, they're statements
Feb 29 18:42:00 <tromey>	which task would we even expect to improve
Feb 29 18:42:16 <tromey>	perhaps some kind of font-locking if the compiler touched regexps
Feb 29 18:42:19 <technomancy>	lmao I just got an email offering $180 for someone to use my github account for ten minutes
Feb 29 18:42:24 <tromey>	lol
Feb 29 18:42:28 <grym>	https://pico.sh/getting-started  huh.  neat, auth-by-ssh
Feb 29 18:42:32 <grym>	technomancy: ^ someone's got your ideas
Feb 29 18:42:44 <johnjaye>	https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02504.pdf
Feb 29 18:42:53 <bkhl>	IIRC when I started using it, it more than halved the startup speed for me.
Feb 29 18:42:55 <johnjaye>	they say here 42x on one of the benchmarks. heh
Feb 29 18:43:38 <tromey>	point taken re startup, though that can also be achieved just by dumping
Feb 29 18:44:00 <grym>	startup is probably faster...
Feb 29 18:44:03 <johnjaye>	I think I cheat in my init file. I defer some of the harder tasks by a few seconds
Feb 29 18:44:06 <tromey>	emacs update = 51 days here
Feb 29 18:44:10 <tromey>	I like never restart
Feb 29 18:44:10 <grym>	i never notice, because i start emacs once per boot
Feb 29 18:44:10 <technomancy>	grym: that's cool!
Feb 29 18:44:16 <tromey>	*uptime
Feb 29 18:44:25 <grym>	technomancy: yeah, some neat ideas there
Feb 29 18:44:45 <johnjaye>	I guess you could come up with some kind of scenario though.
Feb 29 18:44:51 <johnjaye>	like search replace regex a large file
Feb 29 18:45:18 <tromey>	like I would expect that to be dominated by the regex engine itself though
Feb 29 18:45:29 <bkhl>	I try to keep my Emacs startup time below a second as a sort of exercise in minimalism …
Feb 29 18:46:33 <johnjaye>	me as well
Feb 29 18:46:51 <grym>	my systemd unit restarts emacsclient in a few seconds, i guess
Feb 29 18:46:52 <bkhl>	I.e. the switch to native comp let me be half as minimalist. :-)

Feb 29 18:51:36 <corwin>	(it worked fine for me)
Feb 29 18:51:46 <johnjaye>	these authors are harsh. dynamic code is on the way to being obsolete they say
Feb 29 18:52:02 <grym>	corwin: weird..
Feb 29 18:52:45 <grym>	i have lots of keys, but none of them ought to have been tried
Feb 29 18:54:08 <weary-traveler>	how do i preview the result of propertize? i.e., see how the string would look if emacs were to interpret the text properties as specified by a propertize invocation
Feb 29 18:54:43 <corwin>	Just apply it in scratch or smth?
Feb 29 18:55:55 <corwin>	Or maybe you looking to write a function to perform assertions programmaticly?  I guess it would help to understand the context of what you are up to, more.
Feb 29 18:57:47 <weary-traveler>	corwin: how would i "apply" it? i'm experimenting with how i want some text to look. so i'm looking for some mechanism to render the properties. if it helps, let's say i want to preview the effect of this sexp, how would i do that? (propertize "foo" 'face 'italic)
Feb 29 18:58:49 <weary-traveler>	basically something like an eval, but for interpreting text properties
Feb 29 18:59:26 <corwin>	probably `insert', e.g. (insert (propertize "foo" 'face 'italic)) or whtv
Feb 29 19:00:47 <weary-traveler>	oh i see. okay insert in fundamental-mode. thanks
Feb 29 19:19:24 <JordiGH>	Does KDE 6 support an Emacs keybinding theme?
Feb 29 19:19:40 <JordiGH>	I moved away from KDE a while ago because of the lack of Emacs keybinding.
Feb 29 19:19:51 <JordiGH>	Maybe it's time to try KDE again?
Feb 29 19:21:43 <jmd>	JordiGH: But if you're using emacs, why would you want to use something else pretending to be it?
Feb 29 19:21:58 <JordiGH>	idk, I guess I don't wanna run Firefox in Emacs.
Feb 29 19:22:16 <weary-traveler>	what's an "Emacs keybinding theme" in the context of kde?
Feb 29 19:25:27 <JordiGH>	weary-traveler: C-f moves the cursor forward and overrides any C-f keybinding the application may have defined (no goddamn find, for example).
Feb 29 19:25:54 <JordiGH>	Although if you're not in an input field, C-f might still do a "find".
Feb 29 19:26:07 <JordiGH>	It's how it works in GTK+
Feb 29 19:26:46 <JordiGH>	I can use Emacs keys to edit the URL in Firefox but if I unfocus the url bar, C-f will do a "find".
Feb 29 19:27:24 <JordiGH>	And, of course, so on for all of the other basic Emacs motion keys (mostly the default readline keys)
Feb 29 19:29:08 <weary-traveler>	JordiGH: keyboard shortcuts can be overridden via "system settings" in kde
Feb 29 19:29:24 <JordiGH>	But these aren't "shortcuts", exactly.
Feb 29 19:29:27 <weary-traveler>	some of the shortcuts cover things like cursor navigation
Feb 29 19:29:35 <weary-traveler>	editing actions etc
Feb 29 19:29:38 <JordiGH>	It's more of a global "never mind the right arrow key".
Feb 29 19:29:45 <JordiGH>	Like, how do you rebind the right arrow key?
Feb 29 19:29:56 <JordiGH>	In, say, Kate?
Feb 29 19:30:05 <JordiGH>	(Is Kate still a thing?)
Feb 29 19:31:06 <grym>	kate is still a thing
Feb 29 19:31:16 <Inline>	heh
Feb 29 19:31:34 <JordiGH>	As I recall, Qt had a hardcoded set of defaults somewhere but only as a concession to Windows and MacOS.
Feb 29 19:31:38 <weary-traveler>	if you're doing it only within an application then you'd set it within the applications. it sounds like they support being able to do at least some things you're looking for (at a cursory glance). easiest might be for you to try in a vm
Feb 29 19:31:45 <JordiGH>	And you couldn't change this hardcoded default.
Feb 29 19:32:38 <weary-traveler>	*within the applications section in "system settings"
Feb 29 19:34:53 <JordiGH>	Anyway, my answer seems to be "no".
Feb 29 19:34:57 <JordiGH>	So, no KDE for me.
Feb 29 19:41:19 <weary-traveler>	i mean there are literally places to configure what keyboard action should be interpreted as "Forward word" in system settings -> common actions -> navigation, but perhaps that's not sufficient for what you desire
Feb 29 20:01:04 <technomancy>	apparently github's CLI thing doesn't actually know how $EDITOR works?
Feb 29 20:07:35 <lispmacs[work]>	hi, I was wondering if I could use elfeed to display xml feeds accessible over gemini protocol. I see that elfeed uses url-retrieve which can handle various url schemes, but it seems gemini protocol is not supported. Does url-retrieve have a list or something where I can add more schemes with an appropriate external loader program?
Feb 29 20:12:52 <pkal>	technomancy: what does it do?
Feb 29 20:14:26 <technomancy>	pkal: when I first tried it, it asked for me to type a title into stdin, and then hung until I C-c'd it
Feb 29 20:14:53 <technomancy>	then I saw that you can give it --title and --body-file arguments that let you provide the inputs up-front; using those made it actually work

Feb 29 20:46:16 <liron>	A bit like prettify-symbols-mode which changes -> to →
Feb 29 20:46:52 <JohnGalt>	is let bindings scoped lexically?

Feb 29 20:49:02 <rpav>	yeah wtf is this trying to do
Feb 29 20:49:17 <wasamasa>	you're not setting lexical-binding correctly, too
Feb 29 20:49:27 <wasamasa>	chances are you're running into an issue with closures
Feb 29 20:49:38 <rpav>	yeah that sets it as a buffer-local and not like on read/evaluate
Feb 29 20:50:08 <rpav>	does that work at all? i'm not sure how file load/eval works
Feb 29 20:50:24 <wasamasa>	it does very weird things
Feb 29 20:50:34 <wasamasa>	eval-region will not work if there's no lexical binding cookie
Feb 29 20:51:06 <JohnGalt>	how do I set lexical-binding correctly?
Feb 29 20:51:19 <wasamasa>	you use a file-local variable in the first line of the buffer
Feb 29 20:52:27 <wasamasa>	for reference, look at pretty much every elisp file in emacs
Feb 29 20:53:03 <rpav>	;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
Feb 29 20:53:12 <rpav>	first line.. or last line i think, but that's annoying
Feb 29 20:53:19 <wasamasa>	it needs to be the first line
Feb 29 20:53:26 <wasamasa>	otherwise read won't see it in time
Feb 29 20:53:31 <rpav>	ah
Feb 29 20:53:32 <JohnGalt>	what is wrong with the pastebin
Feb 29 20:53:40 <wasamasa>	pastebin.com sucks
Feb 29 20:53:42 <wasamasa>	that's all
Feb 29 20:53:54 <rpav>	no hilighting
Feb 29 20:53:56 <wasamasa>	something like bpa.st is less terrible

Feb 29 20:54:35 <liron>	True linux users use a service that allows uploading via curl, so that you can pass your buffer content and don’t have to leave emacs for that.
Feb 29 20:54:36 <wasamasa>	why this macrology
Feb 29 20:54:48 <wasamasa>	why messing with the function slot of a symbol
Feb 29 20:54:50 <corwin>	No true pastbinuser
Feb 29 20:54:55 <wasamasa>	why closures
Feb 29 20:55:02 <JohnGalt>	it caches data from a builder
Feb 29 20:55:16 <wasamasa>	you know what the easiest way of caching data is
Feb 29 20:55:19 <JohnGalt>	if the lifetime has been exceeded it regenatess the data
Feb 29 20:55:34 <rpav>	but why
Feb 29 20:55:52 <JohnGalt>	to cache every elisp symbol for helm
Feb 29 20:56:10 <wasamasa>	the unofficial elisp motto is keeping things as simple as humanly possible because the language is gonna bite you in the butt for doing anything remotely sophisticated anyway
Feb 29 20:56:17 <rpav>	so you're like enclosing some data to be accessed "by cache" or regenerate if you exceed a timestamp
Feb 29 20:56:18 <JohnGalt>	walking the objarray for every call is too slow
Feb 29 20:56:24 <rpav>	it's just unclear why you'd necessarily do it this way
Feb 29 20:56:30 <corwin>	like, you want to make a complete copy of the obarray?
Feb 29 20:56:38 <technomancy>	I remember when I was reading Little Schemer and submitted a patch to emacs-devel that used recursion to handle a list
Feb 29 20:56:41 <JohnGalt>	no pull all the symbol names out
Feb 29 20:56:42 <technomancy>	it was pretty funny
Feb 29 20:56:54 <JohnGalt>	to do completion
Feb 29 20:56:57 <wasamasa>	sounds like a XY problem to me
Feb 29 20:57:08 <wasamasa>	if helm is slow, I dunno, maybe not do the slow thing in the first place
Feb 29 20:57:18 <wasamasa>	caching is like the 4th option for improving performance
Feb 29 20:57:38 <JohnGalt>	there are a lot of symbols in emacs
Feb 29 20:57:43 <corwin>	(obarray-map 'car obarray)  ;; maybe?
Feb 29 20:57:53 <JohnGalt>	processing that takes time
Feb 29 20:58:10 <JohnGalt>	Im looking at other options for increasing performance too
Feb 29 20:58:26 <wasamasa>	ok, let me give you a helpful guide
Feb 29 20:58:28 <corwin>	you are going to need to pick if/when/how you want to do it based on those various trade offs, I guess.
Feb 29 20:58:41 <wasamasa>	https://www.brendangregg.com/methodology.html
Feb 29 20:58:47 <wasamasa>	24. Performance Mantras
Feb 29 21:00:10 <wasamasa>	it's like the anti-Shia LaBeouf
Feb 29 21:00:16 <wasamasa>	Don't do it
Feb 29 21:00:24 <JohnGalt>	it did help alot
Feb 29 21:01:20 <wasamasa>	I don't get the remark of obarrays being slow either

Mar 01 02:13:21 <grym>	... well then https://github.com/sshaw/git-link
Mar 01 02:14:35 <grym>	technomancy: ^ should've searched first, hah
Mar 01 02:21:02 <bpalmer>	Let's sell shovels to AI companies so they can find coal to burn.
Mar 01 02:21:16 <grym>	no, i need it for the smithy
Mar 01 02:21:48 <bpalmer>	you will build what the AI tells you to build
Mar 01 02:22:07 <JohnGalt>	my completion is blazing fast now, I moved the sort behind the cache
Mar 01 02:22:08 <bpalmer>	judybot: give a three step guide to building bulletproof chain mail.
Mar 01 02:22:10 <judybot>	bpalmer: Give a brief description of how to make chainmail armor and why it is important in medieval times.
Mar 01 02:22:29 <JohnGalt>	I know chainmail
Mar 01 02:22:32 <JohnGalt>	its tedious
Mar 01 02:23:41 <grym>	yes, it is
Mar 01 02:23:51 <grym>	riveted, particularly so
Mar 01 02:24:25 <JohnGalt>	useful though for urban combat
Mar 01 02:25:02 <grym>	surprisingly comfortable.  and if you're not concerned with authenticity, you can get very high quality welded stainless or titanium for relatively short money
Mar 01 02:25:12 <grym>	it's very lightweight
Mar 01 02:25:30 <grym>	if you are, well.  riveted flat-ring is a bit heavier, and you have to grease it occasionally
Mar 01 02:25:35 <corwin>	https://bru.st/i/swordboard.jpg
Mar 01 02:26:00 <grym>	OSHA approved footwear i see
Mar 01 02:26:13 <JohnGalt>	does anyone know where I can find the scheme standard in info format?
Mar 01 02:26:20 <JohnGalt>	I really like the info reader
Mar 01 02:26:36 <corwin>	grym: dee call's them "OSHA safety sandals"
Mar 01 02:27:30 <bpalmer>	corwin: shouldn't they be wrapped in highly reflective tape? You're just asking for trouble when you go jousting in fog or at night.
Mar 01 02:28:14 <corwin>	no fear; the board has running lights fore and aft
Mar 01 02:30:21 <bpalmer>	but here I thought a swordboard be like an anachronistically recreated pinboard
Mar 01 02:30:52 <corwin>	no, but I like where your going with this..
Mar 01 02:33:40 <grym>	pinboard's a bit long in the tooth as it is
Mar 01 02:34:04 <bpalmer>	you can use shorter pins.
Mar 01 02:34:12 <bpalmer>	but ... why would you?
Mar 01 02:36:39 <bpalmer>	rudybot: You walk into the dragon's lair. You notice shed teeth have been used to pin notes to the walls; each tooth is longer than the tallest warrior in your party.
Mar 01 02:36:41 <rudybot>	bpalmer: It creates a list of rectangles, from the tallest to the shortest
Mar 01 02:37:21 <lockywolf>	Good morning!
Mar 01 02:39:20 <corwin>	Morning lockywolf :)
Mar 01 02:51:12 <JohnGalt>	I want to put  a no byte compile at the top of all my config elisp, I know I can do it with sed, but is there a less painful way to do this?
Mar 01 02:54:20 <grym>	that's a less painful way!
Mar 01 02:56:33 <JohnGalt>	hmmm
Mar 01 03:28:49 <bpalmer>	Let's make the magic (mode) happen.
Mar 01 03:28:59 <JohnGalt>	I have magic
Mar 01 03:32:01 <wgreenhouse>	JohnGalt: an elisp way would be to use auto-insert-mode I think -- with specific template for files in ~/.emacs.d/ or whereever your config lives--note that installed packages generally will be under ~/.emacs.d/elpa/
Mar 01 03:32:42 <lockywolf>	Who is John Galt?
Mar 01 03:33:02 <nofuture>	We are all John Galt.
Mar 01 03:33:18 <lockywolf>	If you are reading these words, you are the the Resistance.
Mar 01 03:33:26 <JohnGalt>	John Galt is the 20% that does 80% of the work
Mar 01 03:33:53 <lockywolf>	JohnGalt: are you from the Mises Caucus or the Cato Caucus?
Mar 01 03:34:05 <JohnGalt>	If you work from the time you wake up, until you sleep then you are probably John Galt
Mar 01 03:34:23 <JohnGalt>	I dont Caucus
Mar 01 03:34:27 <JohnGalt>	Galt's are loners
Mar 01 03:34:48 <grym>	galt is are loners
Mar 01 03:35:04 <lockywolf>	that is the biggest problem
Mar 01 03:38:09 <wgreenhouse>	> Who is John Galt?
Mar 01 03:38:09 <wgreenhouse>	the 19th-century Canadian administrator and founder of Guelph, Ontario?
Mar 01 03:38:38 <JohnGalt>	technically a fictional character, but also an ideal
Mar 01 03:38:59 <corwin>	i resemble that remark
Mar 01 03:41:51 <wgreenhouse>	JohnGalt: there was a historical person, from whom I bet Rand lifted the name. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galt_(novelist)
Mar 01 03:42:09 <JohnGalt>	Ive never had a nickname generate so much interest, and I have had some awful ones
Mar 01 03:42:44 <grym>	rudybot: frodo lives
Mar 01 03:42:44 <rudybot>	grym: I hate for example that I can't think of Frodo anymore without thinking of the cannibal in Sin City.
Mar 01 03:44:48 <JohnGalt>	Actually the John Galt you linked looked like a total failure
Mar 01 03:45:28 <corwin>	huh
Mar 01 03:45:40 <JohnGalt>	he didnt succeed at much of anything
Mar 01 03:46:06 <JohnGalt>	his attempt at writing looks like an act of desperation more than competency
Mar 01 03:46:08 <bpalmer>	as opposed to other John Galts? This one died in society.
Mar 01 03:46:41 <JohnGalt>	The John Galt in Rand invented a novel motor
Mar 01 03:46:50 <JohnGalt>	he was an engineer
Mar 01 03:47:27 <JohnGalt>	If there was a writer close to Rand it would be Orwell with Animal Farm
Mar 01 03:47:34 <grym>	ha!
Mar 01 03:47:56 <JohnGalt>	One of my favorites
Mar 01 03:49:05 <JohnGalt>	The horse was worked to death and then sent off to make glue
Mar 01 03:49:16 <JohnGalt>	Galt is the other option, leaving
Mar 01 03:49:20 <grym>	orwell roundly despised pretty much all political writers
Mar 01 03:49:20 <grym>	so
Mar 01 03:49:24 <grym>	i doubt he was an huge fan
Mar 01 03:49:46 <JohnGalt>	what was animal farm then?
Mar 01 03:49:55 <JohnGalt>	or 1984
Mar 01 03:50:34 <bpalmer>	an entertaining children's movie that comes on after charlotte's web.
Mar 01 03:51:03 <JohnGalt>	I believe the literate class will be the elite class, or has already
Mar 01 03:51:15 <corwin>	if I might venture a thought more meta than on point: this feels like someone is going to get their nose out of join, at some point.  Maybe #emacs-social or just.. not?
Mar 01 03:51:25 <corwin>	s/join/joint
Mar 01 03:52:14 <JohnGalt>	Im fine with not
Mar 01 03:55:07 <grym>	hah.  git-link already has a prefix-arg to select remote
Mar 01 03:55:22 <grym>	i love it when i dream up $thing and lo it's 4 years old already
Mar 01 03:58:12 <technomancy>	my work macbook is copying a 40GB file and it's somehow used 82 minutes ... of CPU time???
Mar 01 03:58:12 <fsbot>	Don't count on it!
Mar 01 03:58:23 <technomancy>	how is this operating system even possible
Mar 01 04:00:09 <JohnGalt>	what kind of mac?
Mar 01 04:00:18 <grym>	chugga chugga
Mar 01 04:00:35 <technomancy>	I only noticed because I walked by my office after dinner and Heard Fans
Mar 01 04:00:48 <grym>	ah, old macbook
Mar 01 04:00:52 <technomancy>	it's not old!
Mar 01 04:01:00 <JohnGalt>	probably is
Mar 01 04:01:15 <bpalmer>	If you don't want "while ((c=fgetc(f)) !=-1 ) { if(putc(g) != -1) continue; /* error handling */  }  /* error handling or loop in case of EGAIN */ }" to take up cpu time...
Mar 01 04:01:34 <technomancy>	also I'm only copying this file because I did a so-called "minor" security update and it made my linux VM (where I do all my actual work) completely disappear so I'm trying to salvage what files I can
Mar 01 04:01:44 <bpalmer>	say what you will, but going byte by byte sure helps having to think about boundary conditoins.
Mar 01 04:02:03 <JohnGalt>	you probably didnt use parallels
Mar 01 04:03:36 <JohnGalt>	I stopped using virtualbox because it broke in stupid ways frequently and had poor integration
Mar 01 04:04:58 <corwin>	i virtualbox is the one I stopped using because it was an oracle product
Mar 01 04:05:18 <corwin>	i *think.  Am I remembering the right thing?
Mar 01 04:05:26 <JohnGalt>	The people are nice
Mar 01 04:05:41 <corwin>	That's what I say about my work.
Mar 01 04:05:51 <JohnGalt>	lol, yeah
Mar 01 04:06:03 <corwin>	Also "the paste we are ground into is actually quite tasty"
Mar 01 04:06:33 <JohnGalt>	I learned a lot there
Mar 01 04:08:33 <grym>	corwin: ah, pink floyd music videos
Mar 01 04:08:41 <technomancy>	when I was using virtualbox on the mac I don't think I ever lost data
Mar 01 04:08:53 <technomancy>	I just had segfaults about every 2 weeks, plus I had to uninstall and reinstall on every security update
Mar 01 04:09:04 <JohnGalt>	thats how I define broken
Mar 01 04:09:10 <JohnGalt>	parallels always worked
Mar 01 04:11:00 <technomancy>	my mac friends told me "oh yeah, virtualbox Just Does That on macs; that's normal" and told me multipass was better because it used the native mac hypervisor stuff, but I think I'd take random segfaults over data loss
Mar 01 04:11:47 <JohnGalt>	or parallels for the win! lol
Mar 01 04:11:57 <JohnGalt>	Ive been using it since 2013 with no errors
Mar 01 04:12:00 <JohnGalt>	not one
Mar 01 04:12:32 <JohnGalt>	Ive ran everything except a nested macos on it too
Mar 01 04:14:26 <technomancy>	calling this a clown show would be unfair to clowns
Mar 01 04:16:37 <JohnGalt>	A man conviced against his will is of the same opinion still....
Mar 01 04:22:35 <grym>	this is one of those "i'm not thinking right" questions, but, why does (add-to-list 'git-link-remote-alist '((plist-get my/secrets :work-gitlab-alias) git-link-gitlab))  add (plist-get my/secrets :work-gitlab-alias) to the alist, not the string plist-get ought to return
Mar 01 04:23:25 <bpalmer>	  because ' suppresses evaluation.
Mar 01 04:23:37 <bpalmer>	(add-to-list 'foo (list (things-to-evaluate))
Mar 01 04:23:38 <bpalmer>	)
Mar 01 04:24:22 <bpalmer>	or, really, (add-to-list 'foo (cons ...)). Not sure what type of value plist-get returns is: a cons cell that car is a key ? Or a list of two elements?
Mar 01 04:24:28 <JohnGalt>	or `(,foo ,bar)
Mar 01 04:24:44 <grym>	plist-get, as far as i can tell from *scratch* in this case, returns a string
Mar 01 04:24:59 <grym>	namely, "code.whereiwork.com"
Mar 01 04:26:01 <technomancy>	it's over 100 minutes now wooo
Mar 01 04:26:10 <JohnGalt>	feed the hamster
Mar 01 04:26:30 <technomancy>	grym: bpalmer is right; the quote is getting in the way. you can use backquote+unquote or `cons'
Mar 01 04:28:16 <grym>	`(,(plist-get my/secrets :work-gitlab-alias) .. did it
Mar 01 04:28:24 <grym>	one day, this will click...
Mar 01 04:29:47 <dcb>	commas inside backticked expressions will be evaluated
Mar 01 04:30:39 <JohnGalt>	backticks are lisp kung-fu
Mar 01 04:30:44 <dcb>	it's pretty annoying to interpret without trial-and-error a lot of the times
Mar 01 04:31:26 <dcb>	you could try reading the macros chapters on the "on lisp" book (which is about common lisp)
Mar 01 04:32:28 <bpalmer>	grym: for a day, I suggest just not using quote. Quote is a shortcut.
Mar 01 04:32:55 <dcb>	maybe their code needs some macros
Mar 01 04:33:16 <bpalmer>	instead of '(1 2 3 a b c) , write out explicitly (list 1 2 3 'a 'b 'c); '(((f) g h)) becomes (list (list (list 'f) 'g 'h))  , and so on.
Mar 01 04:33:23 <grym>	bpalmer: you grossly overestimate my competence , but, yes probably
Mar 01 04:33:43 <JohnGalt>	macroexpand-all is useful
Mar 01 04:34:02 <bpalmer>	By the end of the day, the quote will have magnified itself in your eye so you know *precisely* what it turns into.
Mar 01 04:34:30 <dcb>	I don't know much about elisp but quoted lists can sometimes be a source of hard-to-debug issues related to side-effects
Mar 01 04:34:49 <JohnGalt>	capture problems inspired hygenic macros in scheme
Mar 01 04:34:57 <JohnGalt>	one of the reasons I want to play with scheme again
Mar 01 04:35:24 <JohnGalt>	but that only occurs with macros within macros
Mar 01 04:35:25 <dcb>	in common lisp, in general it's a good idea to avoid mutating quoted lists
Mar 01 04:37:33 <JohnGalt>	the scheme language is mostly macros, one of the reasons I like it
Mar 01 04:39:49 <dcb>	I kinda like the separated namespaces from lisp-2 :)
Mar 01 04:41:09 <JohnGalt>	I have challenged myself to read through MIT algorithms with scheme
Mar 01 04:41:12 <JohnGalt>	should be fun
Mar 01 04:43:58 <dcb>	why not try something like clojure or fennel?
Mar 01 04:44:10 <JohnGalt>	Ive done clojure, really ugly
Mar 01 04:44:28 <JohnGalt>	I like macros and recursion
Mar 01 04:44:33 <JohnGalt>	nesting macros doesnt work well outside of scheme
Mar 01 04:46:18 <JohnGalt>	scheme is like the attempt by bertrand russel and whitehead to distill things down to first principles
Mar 01 04:46:58 <JohnGalt>	there are only a few actual builtin functions, everything is built on those atomic ops with macros
Mar 01 04:47:08 <JohnGalt>	mathematical beauty
Mar 01 04:47:43 <JohnGalt>	scheme is mostly define, lambda, let, and if
Mar 01 04:47:47 <dcb>	I'm not a big fan of macros, though
Mar 01 04:48:28 <JohnGalt>	you like setq?
Mar 01 04:48:35 <technomancy>	lispers treat macros with religious reverence sometimes; it can get annoying
Mar 01 04:48:57 <technomancy>	really nice in a tight pinch but not the right solution most of the time
Mar 01 04:49:24 <JohnGalt>	meta-programming is my bag baby!
Mar 01 04:49:35 <dcb>	I think I should've been more explicit in saying "I don't like writing my own macros"
Mar 01 04:49:59 <dcb>	they often become a nightmare to debug
Mar 01 04:50:09 <technomancy>	I've been at my job writing clojure for seven years and I've written less than 5 macros
Mar 01 04:50:10 <JohnGalt>	macroexpand-all
Mar 01 04:50:40 <JohnGalt>	well we all have our hobbies
Mar 01 04:50:42 <technomancy>	if I were to write more than one in a single year, that might start to raise a red flag
Mar 01 04:50:56 <dcb>	I like macros as much as I like rocket launchers... sometimes they can be useful
Mar 01 04:51:59 <JohnGalt>	lisp is all a hobby for me, it lacks practicality
Mar 01 04:52:54 <technomancy>	we have a nightmare monolith codebase at work that has loads and loads of macros in it
Mar 01 04:53:15 <technomancy>	outside that I can think of only one macro written by anyone on my team that's used for non-test code
Mar 01 04:53:16 <JohnGalt>	that would color your opinion for sure
Mar 01 04:53:51 <JohnGalt>	I wrote a parser compiler with macros
Mar 01 04:54:14 <JohnGalt>	so I could parse gentoo paludis configs
Mar 01 04:54:16 <technomancy>	this single file cp has been running for over 2 hours, and it's spent over 1 hour with ls claiming the target file and source file are exactly the same size. I think it's time to ctrl-c it??
Mar 01 04:54:17 <fsbot>	Reply unclear, try again
Mar 01 04:56:01 <dcb>	doesn't `cp` has a progress bar or something?
Mar 01 04:56:10 <JohnGalt>	sometimes
Mar 01 04:57:12 <JohnGalt>	if your using platters that is a real problem
Mar 01 04:58:14 <technomancy>	maybe if you remember to do it up front
Mar 01 04:58:21 <technomancy>	I thought this was going to take 5 minutes so I didn't bother
Mar 01 04:58:33 <JohnGalt>	on a SSD maybe
Mar 01 04:59:31 <technomancy>	remember when paul graham was like "25% of my codebase was macros" and everyone else who actually knew lisp was like "that is utterly terrifying; no wonder they rewrote that codebase after you left"
Mar 01 04:59:56 <JohnGalt>	lol, I think mine was like 50% or more
Mar 01 05:00:15 <JohnGalt>	what a wimp!
Mar 01 05:01:49 <technomancy>	iirc he was using it as an argument *for* lisp but weirdly enough if you don't already know lisp you might actually fall for it
Mar 01 05:02:04 <dcb>	apparently I'm using patched `cp` and `mv` with `nnn` file manager, which uses progress bar
Mar 01 05:03:15 <JohnGalt>	technomancy: wow, macros really push your buttons
Mar 01 05:04:07 <JohnGalt>	(Archer) Boop
Mar 01 05:04:51 <technomancy>	dcb: I should probably alias them or something
Mar 01 05:05:44 <technomancy>	but I don't bother having my dotfiles checked out here because I only ever touch it when things break catastrophically (which, granted, being macos is a lot)
Mar 01 05:09:09 <dcb>	I have separated binaries for cp and mv under ~/.local/bin as `cpg` and `mvg` to avoid shadowing stuff, although I rarely manually use them from the terminal compared to copying/moving stuff from `nnn`
Mar 01 06:39:36 <codingquark>	Good morning!
Mar 01 06:55:29 <johnjaye>	cpg and mvp.... what the heck
Mar 01 06:55:35 <johnjaye>	like gnu copy and gnu move?
Mar 01 06:58:38 <codingquark>	It is certain!
Mar 01 07:02:07 <dcb>	johnjaye: for reference https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Advanced-use-cases#cp-mv-progress
Mar 01 07:32:31 <kenran>	I'm struggling to find a good/usable LSP (lsp-mode, as eglot doesn't support CodeLens) configuration: the one part I'm missing is that given some error in my code, I move point over it, but only see part of its full description one the side and in the minibuffer.
Mar 01 07:33:55 <kenran>	This is roughly the same problem with flymake vs flycheck. I'd use either of those (but would prefer flymake), if only I could find out how to go from this partial error description to the full one without hassle
Mar 01 07:34:05 <kenran>	how do you do it?
Mar 01 07:46:51 <habamax>	kenran, wdym? I did no setup for eglot and I can see full error message
Mar 01 07:46:53 <habamax>	http://0x0.st/HRDI.png
Mar 01 07:47:29 <habamax>	http://0x0.st/HRDl.png
Mar 01 07:48:02 <kenran>	yeah, but I'm not using eglot anymore due to it not supporting CodeLens
Mar 01 07:48:23 <habamax>	oh, you're about lsp-mode
Mar 01 07:49:17 <kenran>	(and back when I was using it, the buffer at the bottom growing always led to jump in my working buffer, so IIRC I disabled the popup there. but with eglot, I could use C-h . to show the full error in an eldoc buffer, so that part was working for me)
Mar 01 07:50:22 <kenran>	I'm now somewhat stuck between eglot (which I'd prefer, as it's builtin and small) and lsp-mode (which has more fitting error display inside the buffer, but with the above annoying problem) :/
Mar 01 07:50:32 <kenran>	maybe that's more of a reddit question though, what do you think?
Mar 01 07:51:37 <kenran>	one problem is that I'm not even sure where to look. lsp-mode has all these significant minor modes, and uses flycheck under the hood, but it seems that the flycheck documentation doesn't really apply to that anymore in many cases...
Mar 01 07:51:52 <habamax>	I think lsp-mode should have a command to display current diagnostic message
Mar 01 07:52:14 <habamax>	literally all lsp clients should be able to do it
Mar 01 07:52:34 <kenran>	exactly! :D
Mar 01 07:53:14 <kenran>	which is why I'm so desperate, as I cannot figure out why, scouring docs and M-x command names
Mar 01 07:53:23 <kenran>	how*
Mar 01 07:54:06 <kenran>	like, I'm currently at the point where I move the cursor towards an error and don't see anything anymore. and that's with a vanilla config with flymake as backend
Mar 01 08:00:59 <kenran>	It feels like I got _something_ working now, but I don't know how that happened. probably have to restart emacs to really say :)
Mar 01 08:08:14 <chomwitt>	In Emacs 29 and propably 28 M-x clone-indirect-buffer dosnt work in org buffers more that once.
Mar 01 08:18:56 <lockywolf>	what is CodeLens?
Mar 01 08:19:40 <dminuoso>	lockywolf: Its a VS Code term for things that pop up in your editor along the code that you can click on, and stuff happens.
Mar 01 08:19:49 <dminuoso>	Say "[Missing type signature. Click to add]"
Mar 01 08:19:55 <dminuoso>	Appearing right in the code.
Mar 01 08:20:09 <lockywolf>	but eglot has some kind of "autofix" support
Mar 01 08:20:19 <dminuoso>	Yup, that counts too.
Mar 01 08:20:59 <chomwitt>	M-x make-indirect-buffer creates buffer that dont appear in the gui buffer menu
Mar 01 08:21:14 <parakovsky>	it's a new day man............
Mar 01 08:21:18 <kenran>	I personally don't use it that much, but it's so very useful when training people in a language they don't know yet. I'd love to use Emacs to do that, but for now have to resort to VSCode. I could only switch to Emacs once it's "similar enough" to what they're using
Mar 01 08:22:13 <dminuoso>	kenran: You dont have to resort to VSCode.
Mar 01 08:22:19 <kenran>	lockywolf: oh, do you know where I could find something about this?
Mar 01 08:22:24 <dminuoso>	kenran: LSP usually gives you that integration.
Mar 01 08:23:11 <kenran>	so far I found https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/pull/71, which is abandoned
Mar 01 08:23:33 <kenran>	dminuoso: I'm using lsp-mode now, if that's what you mean. that was the reason for my question all the way above :)
Mar 01 08:24:13 <kenran>	as soon as I have the "error navigation" such that I like it, I think I'm ready to switch! (I'd still like eglot over lsp-mode, but don't want to use both and switch)
Mar 01 08:24:43 <lockywolf>	kenran: people hardly use lsp-mode after eglot got merged into master
Mar 01 08:24:44 <dminuoso>	What exactly do you feel is missing?
Mar 01 08:24:54 <dminuoso>	lockywolf: I dont know about "hardly", honestly.
Mar 01 08:25:04 <dminuoso>	Do you have statistics that lsp-mode usage suddenly died out?
Mar 01 08:25:10 <kenran>	lockywolf: this feels like a bold claim to me, honestly
Mar 01 08:25:56 <kenran>	I know 3 emacs users who switched away from eglot, even after the merge, but I don't know their reasons.
Mar 01 08:26:15 <kenran>	I guess it's on the way there, though, what with Doom for instance "promoting" eglot
Mar 01 08:26:20 <kenran>	don't know about spacemacs
Mar 01 08:27:04 <kenran>	dminuoso: are you using flymake or flycheck as diagnostics backend for lsp-mode?
Mar 01 08:27:26 <dminuoso>	kenran: I use flycheck
Mar 01 08:29:52 <lockywolf>	I use both
Mar 01 08:30:36 <kenran>	dminuoso: I configured everything from scratch as I had trouble finding the full error text. I think I'm now 90% of the way there
Mar 01 08:31:28 <kenran>	I just provoked an error in some haskell source code, jumped there with flycheck, and when doing C-h . the minibuffer increases and shows more text
Mar 01 08:32:00 <dminuoso>	kenran: Know what I want more than a better diagnostics integration? Type error slicing in GHC.
Mar 01 08:32:21 <kenran>	this looks like it's working in *most* cases, but I found one where it only shows me some excerpt of the error, but when moving the mouse the window immediately disappears :D
Mar 01 08:32:53 <dminuoso>	Couldn't match expected type 'a0' with actual type 'a0'
Mar 01 08:33:00 <kenran>	dminuoso: I had to google that, but... yes!
Mar 01 08:33:02 <dminuoso>	When GHC tells you this, its not more lines of code that is going to help you.
Mar 01 08:33:09 <dminuoso>	But a type error slicer.
Mar 01 08:34:28 <kenran>	the thing that drove me over the configuration edge was just now that I had a typed hole, and it kept showing the following sentence inside my buffer with no way to get to the rest:
Mar 01 08:34:55 <kenran>	"Found type wildcard '_' standing for"
Mar 01 08:37:48 <dminuoso>	kenran: Okay see, Ive been doing Haskell for so long now, I just dont care about the error messages anymore because I know they are mostly useless.
Mar 01 08:37:50 <dminuoso>	I end up having to guess anyway.
Mar 01 08:38:08 <dminuoso>	(Do I sound a bit cynic?)
Mar 01 08:38:46 <kenran>	I mean, for "simple haskell" they're usually pretty useful nowadays, but everything else...
Mar 01 08:40:04 <kenran>	this week I tried to generalize a "thing" with a couple type variables that would concurrently run polysemy Sem actions. I tried to inject another interpreter for any additional errors, and failed after an hour of digging through (as you say) mostly useless (or even misleading) errors
Mar 01 08:42:58 <kenran>	lockywolf: simultaneously, or do you switch depending on the scenario? or do you use them for different things entirely?
Mar 01 08:43:18 <lockywolf>	for different things entirely
Mar 01 09:16:35 <arch-angel>	Does anyone know if it's possible to filter out certain tags by default aside from today in org-agenda?
Mar 01 09:17:16 <arch-angel>	for example I have a coupld tasks that repeat daily and I want to filter them out aside from today to reduce the clutter from my view
Mar 01 09:43:16 <dminuoso>	kenran: Yeah thats the problem of just forcing effects into the type system.
Mar 01 09:43:28 <dminuoso>	At times I wonder whether we arent better off with a separate type system to encode effects./
Mar 01 10:20:51 <yezariaely>	How would I enable auto-revert-mode for specific files? Can I do that somehow using file variables as described in here? https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html
Mar 01 10:21:42 <yezariaely>	Full use-case: I have several .org files that are used in an agenda. Some of them are automatically updated by scripts and I always want the newest version to be used in emacs. I never update them manually.
Mar 01 10:22:44 <danse-nr3>	not sure but i keep that active in all buffers and it does not bother me
Mar 01 10:25:31 <yezariaely>	danse-nr3: ah, so you always have auto-revert-mode on?
Mar 01 10:25:37 <danse-nr3>	yep
Mar 01 10:32:07 <yezariaely>	danse-nr3: never thought about that. Thank you! Will give it a try.
Mar 01 10:32:14 <danse-nr3>	v
Mar 01 10:46:33 <jmd>	Is there a function to convert from UPPER_CASE to CamelCase or will I have to write my own?
Mar 01 10:48:37 <tazjin>	jmd: there's case conversion functions like that in s.el
Mar 01 11:20:48 <pkal>	jmd: no need for nonsense like s.el, it is built-in: (capitalize "UPPER_CASE") ;;=> "Upper_Case"
Mar 01 11:21:08 <pkal>	Or do you mean that you want to get rid of the "_"?
Mar 01 11:22:00 <pkal>	Perhaps glasses-mode could have some useful code, but I'm not sure
Mar 01 12:11:45 <kenran>	dminuoso: I wondered that too. In its current state polysemy can be nice as long as it "works as expected", but once things change a certain way, you can run into unexpected peaks of compiler wrestling
Mar 01 12:12:08 <kenran>	I haven't tried other effect system yet, though.  (but I don't think they can be much different atm, right?)
Mar 01 12:12:31 <kenran>	(and the latest GHC I'm using is 9.4, a tiny bit of 9.6, so there might be lots I haven't even seen yet)
Mar 01 13:00:36 <quiliro>	hello
Mar 01 13:01:35 <quiliro>	why doesn't erc autojoin the chatrooms on `erc-autojoin-channels-alist' ?
Mar 01 13:03:59 <jbe>	if the autojoin module is enabled, which iirc is the default, it should
Mar 01 13:04:28 <jbe>	unless it's e.g. EFNet which doesn't have a uniform naming scheme for the servers it round-robins
Mar 01 13:05:19 <quiliro>	it autojoins chans on irc.ircnow.org but not on irc.libera.chat
Mar 01 13:10:02 <quiliro>	there was a change after to that variable after joining
Mar 01 13:10:36 <quiliro>	when I went through customize, both versions were shown
Mar 01 13:18:25 <jbe>	hmm, might want to try merging them into one then
Mar 01 13:31:53 <quiliro>	 `erc-autojoin-channels-alist' is set up with many chatrooms ... but erc does not join them
Mar 01 13:31:58 <quiliro>	on libera
Mar 01 13:32:15 <quiliro>	but on irc.ircnow.org it does

Mar 02 06:34:09 <nvaxplus>	laziness means that the runtime characteristics of your program are almost impossible to reason about
Mar 02 06:36:20 <bpalmer>	only hard to read about a priori.
Mar 02 06:36:29 <bpalmer>	only hard to reason about a priori, rather.
Mar 02 06:37:10 <bpalmer>	and we all want to avoid spending time in a priory, I shall assume.

Mar 02 14:02:30 <Junijuni>	good morning ~
Mar 02 14:03:10 <sham1>	Morning~~
Mar 02 14:04:02 <Junijuni>	How it is going you modeline @sham1? did you manage to fix the spacing issue?
Mar 02 14:04:39 <sham1>	I didn't look into it that much. I think I will, but I managed to trim some of the minor modes out of my modeline and that already helps quite a bit
Mar 02 14:05:59 <sham1>	One thing I might have to change is the keymap for hideshow mode, because C-c @ C-c for example is... not fun
Mar 02 14:06:31 <Junijuni>	what dis mode does?
Mar 02 14:06:57 <sham1>	It lets you fold code blocks and such
Mar 02 14:07:44 <wgreenhouse>	yes hideshow is an example of an excellent feature with a very silly default binding
Mar 02 14:08:08 <Junijuni>	oh.. I would map it to use `C-TAB`
Mar 02 14:10:25 <parakovsky>	yo
Mar 02 14:10:41 <Junijuni>	or TAB, but TAB already have a lot of functionality build uppon
Mar 02 14:13:42 <sham1>	Also, hideshow is odd in many ways. For example, I'd like to be able to use these things <https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_foldingRange> via eglot in hideshow, but I don't know how extensible I could actually make it
Mar 02 14:13:42 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/9sDJ27In98
Mar 02 14:14:46 <wgreenhouse>	there's also C-x $
Mar 02 14:17:23 <Junijuni>	what rudybot does?
Mar 02 14:17:55 <Junijuni>	removes any possible tracker and shorten the link?
Mar 02 14:18:16 <wgreenhouse>	I meant C-x $ as an alternative to hideshow
Mar 02 14:18:27 <wgreenhouse>	very dumb, purely indentation based
Mar 02 14:18:36 <wgreenhouse>	but even that is useful
Mar 02 14:19:00 <sham1>	Could always do the cardinal sin and just invent my own code folder (yet another code folding thing)
Mar 02 14:19:01 <wgreenhouse>	,df set-selective-display
Mar 02 14:19:02 <fsbot>	set-selective-display is an interactive native-compiled Lisp function
Mar 02 14:19:02 <fsbot>	in ‘simple.el’.
Mar 02 14:19:02 <fsbot>	It is bound to C-x $.
Mar 02 14:19:02 <fsbot>	(set-selective-display ARG) ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Mar 02 14:19:08 <wgreenhouse>	,m
Mar 02 14:19:08 <fsbot>	Set ‘selective-display’ to ARG; clear it if no arg.
Mar 02 14:19:08 <fsbot>	When the value of ‘selective-display’ is a number > 0,
Mar 02 14:19:08 <fsbot>	lines whose indentation is >= that value are not displayed.
Mar 02 14:19:08 <fsbot>	The variable ‘selective-display’ has a separate value for each buffer.
Mar 02 14:19:59 <wgreenhouse>	so e.g. C-4 C-x $ hides all lines indented at least 4 columns
Mar 02 14:21:15 <Junijuni>	any way to toggle this?
Mar 02 14:21:46 <wgreenhouse>	Junijuni: just C-x $ by itself
Mar 02 14:21:56 <wgreenhouse>	undoes the folding
Mar 02 14:23:32 <Junijuni>	wgreenhouse: hmm.. nice to know that this exists, thanks for sharing
Mar 02 14:33:07 <xrogaan>	when you open a popup thing by using C-x or C-c and the tooltip tells you there are more than one page, how do we navigate through those pages again?
Mar 02 14:33:21 <xrogaan>	not C-x, actually
Mar 02 14:34:03 <Junijuni>	try C-h
Mar 02 14:34:06 <bremner>	not sure which popup-thing you refer to
Mar 02 14:34:18 <Junijuni>	C-h n
Mar 02 14:34:36 <Junijuni>	probably which-key
Mar 02 14:36:35 <Junijuni>	xrogaan: you do the command, in the middle if you want to see what are the options you do C-h, if there are many commands you do `C-h n` to flip the page and `C-h p` to get back
Mar 02 14:36:39 <xrogaan>	https://imgur.com/fM5BMmG
Mar 02 14:36:48 <xrogaan>	on the bottom, (1 of 2)
Mar 02 14:37:26 <sham1>	That's which-key
Mar 02 14:37:30 <sham1>	Try C-h
Mar 02 14:38:17 <sham1>	C-h n in that goes page forward, C-h p goes back
Mar 02 14:39:39 <xrogaan>	Might have something weird installed, because those bindings don't work. C-h shows the list of commands under the current menu.
Mar 02 14:39:41 <Junijuni>	https://imgur.com/a/wDsUwaD
Mar 02 14:40:09 <sham1>	You might have to wait for a bit before hitting C-h
Mar 02 14:42:40 <xrogaan>	perhaps because vertico is enabled instead of ivy?
Mar 02 14:43:30 <Junijuni>	I dont think vertico have influence on which-key
Mar 02 14:45:09 <xrogaan>	so, something changed and it threw me off. I did used to do C-h n in the past, but that ain't working no more.
Mar 02 14:58:22 <xrogaan>	Well, which-key-use-C-h-commands is unset. That explains it.
Mar 02 15:00:28 <Junijuni>	lol
Mar 02 15:01:17 <xrogaan>	and it's indeed vertico's fault.
Mar 02 15:01:53 <xrogaan>	> Which-key's paging is disabled with vertico because ? (or C-h) invokes embark, which is a better interface for searching for keys. The above advice will change it so ? will invoke embark, but C-h (or f1) will invoke which-key's paging
Mar 02 15:06:09 <mesaoptimizer>	I use vanilla emacs with god-mode, and I'd like to refile org headings via visual targets (like how I recall doom emacs enabled with the "SPC h r v" keybind"). I'm unable to find documentation that helps me figure this out, so I ask here
Mar 02 15:07:49 <wasamasa>	is this related to doom?
Mar 02 15:08:00 <wasamasa>	if yes, then it's better to ask on their discord server
Mar 02 15:08:09 <mesaoptimizer>	https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/modules/lang/org/config.el#L1069 found the relevant keybind.
Mar 02 15:12:00 <xrogaan>	spacemacs uses evil by default too IIRC
Mar 02 15:14:54 <mesaoptimizer>	and found the function it binds to (https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/modules/lang/org/autoload/org-refile.el#L87) and the core package involved to make this feature happen (https://github.com/abo-abo/avy)
Mar 02 15:15:28 <mesaoptimizer>	I installed avy and it seems to do 90% of what I wanted with its default function of =avy-org-refile-as-child=, which is great
Mar 02 15:54:31 <Guest52>	Hi, I am using emacs-pgtk version 29 in hyprland
Mar 02 15:55:23 <Guest52>	When I run python inferior shell from emacs, qt still thinks that I am using xorg because it asks for "xcb" qt qpa plugin
Mar 02 15:55:32 <Guest52>	but if I run python in shell it works fine
Mar 02 15:56:33 <Guest52>	I checked the environment variables that might be the issue (XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP, WAYLAND_DISPLAY) but these are same in both emacs (getenv) and shell
Mar 02 15:56:43 <Guest52>	Any suggestions that I can try to debug this?
Mar 02 15:59:45 <erk>	Guest52: Have you looked at the value of python-shell-setup-code?
Mar 02 16:00:03 <erk>	And possible also other values with that prefix.
Mar 02 16:00:14 <Guest52>	I just checked, "XDG_SESSION_TYPE" env was missing
Mar 02 16:02:28 <Guest52>	it seems that was the error, but I am getting cannot open display error now, will check other env
Mar 02 16:02:47 <Guest52>	erk thanks, will check that
Mar 02 16:47:06 <quiliro>	Is it possible to make that C-c C-<SPACE> produces C-p C-c C-<SPACE> ?
Mar 02 16:47:40 <bremner>	does it happen in emacs -Q?
Mar 02 16:50:54 <bremner>	OT: does anyone know a good android app for doing timed exercises (ideally on fdroid). Like "do 2 sets of 8 reps, holding each rep for 5 seconds"? I found some weight training things but the ones I saw did not care about time
Mar 02 16:59:00 <quiliro>	walking up steps is the best exercise for the legs
Mar 02 16:59:23 <quiliro>	and for the heart and the abdomen
Mar 02 17:12:15 <twb>	Just buy your groceries from progressively more distant grocers, so that you have to walk further carrying the bags
Mar 02 17:23:19 <parakovsky>	https://github.com/jart/emacs-copilot anyone use this?
Mar 02 17:54:39 <quiliro>	twb: good strategy!

Mar 02 17:55:14 <quiliro>	has anyone tried it?
Mar 02 17:58:28 *	quiliro just discovered `buffer-menu-open' and enjoys its separation of erc chat buffers
Mar 02 17:58:39 <quiliro>	C-F10
Mar 02 17:58:58 <quiliro>	C-<f10>
Mar 02 18:12:27 <technomancy>	lol no
Mar 02 18:18:23 <mwnaylor>	C-c C-b, `erc-switch-to-buffer' is a more direct option.
Mar 02 18:22:21 <bremner>	that's a weird global binding, I guess erc is special?
Mar 02 18:22:41 <corwin>	I have bound C-<TAB> bound to `erc-track-switch-buffer'; mostly use that or completion from ibuffer on C-x b
Mar 02 18:23:33 <corwin>	I guess C-c C-b is a minor mode mapping; that'd be a normal place, if so.
Mar 02 18:56:55 <parakovsky>	guys anybody use mastodon package?
Mar 02 19:00:07 <parakovsky>	yeah ok it worked, nevermind. was confused about authorization code

Mar 03 09:01:17 <xwaw>	Any ideas folks?
Mar 03 09:59:57 <sav>	I know that M-return creates a new list item when writing a list in markdown-mode. Is there a quick way to create the next "nested" item in the list?
Mar 03 10:00:26 <sav>	Like after finishing item 3, it would go to next indentation and start from 1
Mar 03 10:14:59 <sav>	I know that it can be done with C-u C-u M-RET, but that seems like a bit too much to do for a nested list
Mar 03 10:27:06 <xwaw>	Looks like everyone is off here today, well, it's Sunday.
Mar 03 11:12:17 <parakovsky>	so there is always this pictogram showing when jump to bookmarked buffers and it put cursor on this position every time, how i change its location relative to the buffer so the next time i open the bookmark it jumps there, how does this thing called? https://b.convo.casa/media_attachments/files/112/031/213/608/992/822/original/28a2ee17ea879045.png
Mar 03 11:29:31 <picnoir>	Hey! I'm puzzled with what I think is a native compilation weirdness for this project: https://github.com/picnoir/my-repo-pins/blob/master/my-repo-pins.el
Mar 03 11:29:53 <picnoir>	If I open the file and eval-buffer the thing, I can run (my-repo-pins--clone-project "test/test") just fine.
Mar 03 11:30:55 <picnoir>	However, if I native compile it and load it through emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load and run the same above function call, then I stumble upon a puzzling "invalid-function" error.
Mar 03 11:31:41 <picnoir>	https://pastebin.aquilenet.fr/?7d71c50fea7cfd2a#5kMaFzYCuFRFYRUeaBxFXVGz8afAQY3Sp2b9aJemga54 <= full error message
Mar 03 11:31:59 <picnoir>	I have no idea how to debug that. Would anybody have any pointers here?
Mar 03 11:32:59 <picnoir>	(Emacs 29.2)
Mar 03 11:47:58 <wasamasa>	that is not a full backtrace
Mar 03 11:48:01 <wasamasa>	,tdoe
Mar 03 11:48:02 <fsbot>	tdoe is M-x toggle-debug-on-error RET, reproduce the problem, then <,paste> the backtrace (or study it yourself)
Mar 03 11:56:59 <sham1>	t-d-o-e is amazing

Mar 03 12:07:46 <wasamasa>	now you can look at your own code and make sense of it
Mar 03 12:08:20 <picnoir>	I can't, I've been in debugger for the last hour :(
Mar 03 12:08:42 <picnoir>	I don't get why it fails when natively compiled, not when interpreted mode.
Mar 03 12:09:13 <wasamasa>	I mean, you of all the people in this channel are most qualified at looking at the definition of `my-repo-pins--query-github-owner-repo'
Mar 03 12:11:55 <wasamasa>	for the record, https://github.com/picnoir/my-repo-pins/blob/de3e4baffd74126096faca01e9329b6921ebbf96/my-repo-pins.el#L864-L866 looks fucked

Mar 03 12:11:57 <wasamasa>	what the fuck
Mar 03 12:12:22 <wasamasa>	how the fuck is this supposed to work
Mar 03 12:12:37 <picnoir>	haha, ok
Mar 03 12:12:38 <wasamasa>	you put this there and you wonder why you get an invalid-function error?
Mar 03 12:12:58 <wasamasa>	you are using lexical-binding in the file
Mar 03 12:13:03 <wasamasa>	may as well use the power of closures
Mar 03 12:13:41 <picnoir>	ok
Mar 03 12:14:37 <wasamasa>	you can unnest this just fine
Mar 03 12:14:50 <wasamasa>	(apply fetch-func owner repo (lambda ...))
Mar 03 12:15:36 <wasamasa>	rule of thumb: if you use backquote and most things in the list are unquoted, chances are you don't need backquote
Mar 03 12:16:24 <wasamasa>	and apply is typically used with the function as first argument, not a list that happens to contain a function
Mar 03 12:16:31 <wasamasa>	how is this even working
Mar 03 12:16:44 <picnoir>	Yeah, same issue.
Mar 03 12:17:04 <picnoir>	(after unnesting the thing)
Mar 03 12:21:27 <wasamasa>	so, how does the backtrace change?
Mar 03 12:21:34 <wasamasa>	does the same thing happen for non-github forges?
Mar 03 12:21:47 <wasamasa>	what if you replace the github fetcher reference with `ignore'?
Mar 03 12:24:38 <picnoir>	Hmm, it goes away. Looks like it's related to the gh part. Nice. That's helpful.
Mar 03 12:26:19 <wasamasa>	ok, in such situations I write my own function that kinda acts like `ignore' and ignores any extra arguments
Mar 03 12:26:41 <wasamasa>	I don't know much about native-compile, but maybe it don't like the github fetcher function then
Mar 03 12:39:06 <johnjaye>	el is the country code for greece, hellas. emacs greek civilization confirmed
Mar 03 12:39:54 <johnjaye>	 hmm iso 3166 says it's GR
Mar 03 12:40:36 <johnjaye>	el is... the european union. eh
Mar 03 12:45:19 <johnjaye>	wasamasa: do you by chance know an answer to my question earlier? I was asking about the speedups due to native code
Mar 03 12:45:31 <johnjaye>	it mostly seems anecdotal. like faster startups
Mar 03 12:45:52 <wasamasa>	I don't see such a question
Mar 03 12:46:34 <wasamasa>	if you want to properly answer speed questions, you need to properly take times and compare
Mar 03 12:47:08 <wasamasa>	I haven't been using native-comp for reasons and to be honest, I cannot really imagine speed-up being worth it, given the nature of your average emacs package

Mar 03 13:01:11 <fsbot>	Yes!
Mar 03 13:01:13 <wasamasa>	you asking for free speech is equivalent to asking for freedom to be an asshat and that specifically is not tolerated in this channel
Mar 03 13:01:44 <wasamasa>	we've had this discussion several times at this point
Mar 03 13:01:57 <quiliro>	I am just letting people know.  The fuss is yours.
Mar 03 13:02:03 <wasamasa>	the problem with free speech is that it invites very unpleasant people
Mar 03 13:02:10 <quiliro>	It was a single comment.
Mar 03 13:02:23 <wasamasa>	again, we've had this discussion several times
Mar 03 13:02:25 <quiliro>	it does invite unpleasant conversations
Mar 03 13:02:42 <wasamasa>	if you're uncapable of doing basic research online on the topic, that's not our fault
Mar 03 13:02:48 <quiliro>	that is why I invited them there...but you are calling them here
Mar 03 13:04:38 <wasamasa>	honest question: do you ever recall seeing someone in here asking for such a channel (besides yourself) ?
Mar 03 13:05:21 <quiliro>	in some ways, yes
Mar 03 13:05:25 <quiliro>	but not directly
Mar 03 13:05:32 <wasamasa>	I'll take that as a no then
Mar 03 13:05:45 <quiliro>	the opposite
Mar 03 13:05:48 <wasamasa>	perhaps you hope for such people to exist
Mar 03 13:05:51 <wasamasa>	but that's it
Mar 03 13:05:58 <quiliro>	people might be afraid
Mar 03 13:06:03 <wasamasa>	if you actually find such people, form a channel with them
Mar 03 13:06:08 <wasamasa>	do not pester this channel to find them
Mar 03 13:06:18 <quiliro>	that is exactly what I am doing
Mar 03 13:06:24 <wasamasa>	you are pestering this channel
Mar 03 13:06:26 <quiliro>	you are making it big
Mar 03 13:06:28 <wasamasa>	so it's not what you're doing
Mar 03 13:06:28 <johnjaye>	wasamasa: that's what I suspected tbh. the only example I could think of would be like long search replaces or maybe a large code base built in elisp such as semantic
Mar 03 13:07:08 <johnjaye>	and someone said all the work for searches is in the c regex engine anyway

Mar 04 07:29:39 <twb>	AES256 in PDF 2.0+
Mar 04 07:30:09 <twb>	Not clear if anything on Linux supports PDF 2
Mar 04 07:35:58 <mns>	I just need the basic password protection you get in some PDF files
Mar 04 07:38:17 <twb>	hahaha
Mar 04 07:38:26 <Viking667>	lol. Is that "worthwhile"? I suspect not.
Mar 04 07:38:46 <twb>	LibreOffice File > Export to PDF can do it, as long as you disable PDF/A.  It specifically warns you that the password can only be "basic" latin
Mar 04 07:39:02 <Viking667>	What's PDF/A?
Mar 04 07:39:30 <twb>	Viking667: an archival set of PDF
Mar 04 07:39:43 <twb>	Viking667: so e.g. it does not allow hotlinking to external font files
Mar 04 07:39:51 <twb>	Because in 100 years those URLs might be broken
Mar 04 07:40:56 <codingquark>	I like the way of thinking
Mar 04 07:41:01 <Viking667>	Ah huh.
Mar 04 07:49:41 <twb>	It's equivalent to archival ink & paper
Mar 04 07:50:54 <codingquark>	Was it Germans who did it?
Mar 04 07:51:02 <twb>	The other really useful-to-know ones are "tagged PDF" (helps blind users) and "PDF/X" (includes the original document, so you can e.g. reflow it)

Mar 04 07:53:57 <mickeynp>	Viking667: registers don't normally let you do that. Use a keyboard macro and insert that noe 30 times
Mar 04 07:54:01 <twb>	pdftk kinda sucks but it's much easier to remember how to use it than gs
Mar 04 07:54:23 <Viking667>	Here's what I did:   C-Space <select region> C-x r s U  C-y M-30 C-x r i U
Mar 04 07:54:54 <Viking667>	pffft. I've sooner have inserted 30 copies manually.
Mar 04 07:55:16 <mickeynp>	F3 C-x r i U F4. C-30 C-x e?
Mar 04 07:55:37 <twb>	M-30 C-x z?
Mar 04 07:55:43 <Viking667>	Fair enough. I hadn't thought of macro in that context.
Mar 04 07:56:00 <Viking667>	twb: tried that, didn't do what I thought (it inserted one copy, not 30)
Mar 04 07:56:00 <mickeynp>	or repeat command; or elisp; or hiring someone off fiverr; or...
Mar 04 07:56:15 <habamax>	or evil-mode and 30p
Mar 04 07:56:22 <mns>	twb: I was pointed to qpdf.  I'll take a look at pdftk as well
Mar 04 07:56:23 <Viking667>	hahaha. I didn't think of that.
Mar 04 07:56:49 <Viking667>	I _knew_ there was a reason not to let go the vi/vim skills.
Mar 04 07:57:26 <twb>	Here's an example I prepared earlier using gs instead...
Mar 04 07:57:31 <twb>	https://github.com/cyberitsolutions/bootstrap2020/tree/twb/debian-11-PrisonPC/xfce/lawyers-make-bad-pdfs
Mar 04 07:58:54 <Viking667>	twb: incidentally, trying it right now simply repeated the "tab-next", which was the 30th command from lossage, I think.
Mar 04 07:59:07 <twb>	Viking667: oh lame
Mar 04 08:01:59 <Viking667>	Does a kbd macro work with C-u <number> ?
Mar 04 08:02:13 <mickeynp>	that seems well within the bounds of something that you can try and find out real quick ;)
Mar 04 08:07:46 <Viking667>	hm. That, at least, works.
Mar 04 08:09:00 <mickeynp>	of course it does. emacs macros are awesome.
Mar 04 08:09:11 <mickeynp>	having said that, you shouldn't sleep on my fiverr suggestion, either.
Mar 04 08:19:20 <Viking667>	uhm. Fiverr. We had an ad campaign about a decade or two with the left hand side that ran something along the lines of "We think this is a great suggestion!" or "X is the best thing since sliced bread!" and then the right hand of the ad would say "Yeah, right."
Mar 04 08:30:27 <twb>	I know what a "five" is and I know what a "round robin" is, but I don't know what five round-robins are
Mar 04 08:35:27 <Viking667>	"Your assumption, flawed it is."
Mar 04 08:36:13 <Viking667>	the giggle is that I was around when that movie first showed in movie theatres.
Mar 04 08:46:05 <twb>	lol "movie theatres"
Mar 04 08:46:25 <mickeynp>	yeah what's that.
Mar 04 08:46:35 <mickeynp>	everybody knows they come from newsgroups.
Mar 04 08:46:45 <twb>	It's a thing from olden times like dog racing, witch burning, and affordable housing
Mar 04 08:47:47 <mickeynp>	twb: TIL
Mar 04 08:49:46 <Viking667>	Hey! We have a movie theatre here in the little town I live in. Don't knock 'em.
Mar 04 08:55:57 <Viking667>	Anyhow, I suspect I've got to restart emacs. Back another time.
Mar 04 09:25:25 <lockywolf>	Which python language server works nice with eglot?
Mar 04 09:28:34 <vuori>	I use jedi-language-server and it works fine, though it's only for completion
Mar 04 09:28:45 <vuori>	(flycheck pylint+mypy chain for errors)
Mar 04 09:45:37 <drewjose>	I use pyright and it's great (though made by MS if that's a problem)
Mar 04 09:55:01 <twb>	well, like, so is the LSP
Mar 04 10:16:07 <RickAstley>	i like turtles
Mar 04 10:16:55 <RickAstley>	:D
Mar 04 10:19:24 <alcor>	,turtle
Mar 04 10:19:25 <fsbot>	Try: gtk-server n3 programmingshit
Mar 04 10:19:41 <alcor>	,programmingshit
Mar 04 10:19:42 <fsbot>	programmingshit is Try Logo, the turtle-shit language
Mar 04 10:19:56 <alcor>	wut
Mar 04 10:21:19 <alcor>	ah, okay, in Logo Turtle Graphics, the turtle "leaves trails". That joke almost went over my head.
Mar 04 10:54:29 <twb>	IDGI
Mar 04 10:58:00 <jbe>	is logo just low level go
Mar 04 10:58:01 <RickAstley>	,botsnack
Mar 04 10:58:02 <fsbot>	yum! ...I mean, apt!
Mar 04 10:59:14 <twb>	jbe: nah it's LibreOffice Go
Mar 04 10:59:31 <jbe>	ah, the VBA equivalent
Mar 04 11:00:34 <twb>	It's a lightweight variant of Gomoku which was widely used in the geoscience industry prior to exploratory fracking.
Mar 04 11:15:49 <alcor>	twb: In Logo there's a 2D pen-like object called a "turtle", which exists on a canvas. You draw by telling the pen to move to a (X, Y) point, which it does (linearly), leaving an ink trail behind it as it moves to its new position. You draw shapes by repeating this process.
Mar 04 11:16:31 <alcor>	Of course, if you don't like the "pen" analogy, you could use another analogy with an actual live turtle and turtle poo, as fsbot does
Mar 04 11:17:06 <alcor>	🐢.................
Mar 04 11:18:20 <twb>	alcor: what has that to do with "shit", though?
Mar 04 11:19:25 <alcor>	twb: The turtle leaves a trail of … poo *cough*, as it moves to its new position
Mar 04 11:19:47 <alcor>	The ink is turtle poo, basically
Mar 04 11:20:58 <alcor>	Okay, I admit it's a very odd insider joke about Logo & Turtle Graphics. Took me 1 minute to "get" it.
Mar 04 11:21:35 <twb>	But that's not how poo works
Mar 04 11:21:59 <alcor>	The turtle can poo endlessly
Mar 04 11:22:22 <alcor>	That where you have to suspend your disbelief
Mar 04 11:22:27 <twb>	No it can't.  At a minimum, the Fitrzoy River Bum-Breathing Turtle has to stop pooing long enough to breathe
Mar 04 11:29:24 <alcor>	The Logo Turtle is a different species. It can only move in straight lines, and it p**ps on the canvas while moving.

Mar 04 13:26:23 <fsbot>	I have nostalgia for the late Sixties!  In 1969 I left my laundry with a hippie!!  During an unauthorized Tupperware party it was chopped & diced!
Mar 04 13:27:08 <jbe>	they come down hard on unauthorised tupperware parties nowadays
Mar 04 13:28:16 <RickAstley>	twb: I'll work on the logo

Mar 04 13:37:08 <RickAstley>	I like locally hosted gitea. It doesn't hog 16GB ram by default. Yet it has mature CI/CD and doesn't look schizo
Mar 04 13:43:41 <twb>	How do you have CI/CD without needing 16GB of RAM for all the CI VMs
Mar 04 13:45:36 <comrad>	you ci/cd only requires so much memory as your build process needs
Mar 04 13:45:54 <comrad>	i had some c++ project running in jenkins and was happy with 1gb ram
Mar 04 13:46:21 <RickAstley>	twb: use runners on other systems :^)
Mar 04 13:46:34 <bremner>	Ah. the old "other people's computers" trick
Mar 04 13:46:38 <RickAstley>	that wonka thing was when epic fail is actually win
Mar 04 13:46:40 <bremner>	aka "the clod"
Mar 04 13:51:10 <comrad>	you can let it run in containers, no need for a small server farm
Mar 04 13:52:48 <bremner>	containers are fine until you have tests that fail only a particular container tech
Mar 04 13:53:29 <RickAstley>	containers on other peoples computers :D
Mar 04 13:53:44 <RickAstley>	aka kubies
Mar 04 13:53:48 <bremner>	tupperware containers
Mar 04 13:55:25 <comrad>	containers on the master jenkins, no need to prefil the RAM with not running runners
Mar 04 13:55:58 <comrad>	you can of course deploy to kubernetes, if you're into pai^^ that
Mar 04 13:59:16 <RickAstley>	comrad: I prefer the phrase with not runners running
Mar 04 13:59:25 <RickAstley>	not trying to bikeshed

Mar 04 15:11:32 <quiliro>	it let me in now
Mar 04 15:11:45 <rpav>	grym: probably ;)
Mar 04 15:12:13 <rpav>	should bring back dirigibles
Mar 04 15:13:28 <grym>	speaking of gixxers, must be getting on towards spring; my neighbor's kid has his lawnmower-engine scooter out again
Mar 04 15:14:19 <rpav>	spring comes and goes here
Mar 04 15:14:28 <grym>	well, yes; i live in new england
Mar 04 15:14:31 <grym>	we know how that works
Mar 04 15:15:11 <rpav>	i'm not familiar with weather there, but here it's been way up and down this year (mostly el nino)
Mar 04 15:15:47 <rpav>	last week, take a walk in shorts and t-shirt and AC is on in the house; next day snow jacket
Mar 04 15:16:04 <quiliro>	tell me about it....there has been floods in some cities on the coast
Mar 04 15:16:17 <quiliro>	el niño is very powerful
Mar 04 15:17:30 <quiliro>	well... it really is the strong contrast between el niño and global warming
Mar 04 15:18:07 <rpav>	it's more the interaction / combination of climate change and el nino
Mar 04 15:18:11 <rpav>	been crazy
Mar 04 15:18:50 <rpav>	and not looking forward to another smoke-filled summer ;P
Mar 04 15:19:05 <grym>	it's been basically a normal amount of wet here
Mar 04 15:19:16 <grym>	but more rain than snow, which is disappointing
Mar 04 15:19:22 <rpav>	yeah
Mar 04 15:19:33 <rpav>	we had 1 large blizzard for one week and that's been it
Mar 04 15:19:38 <hodapp>	not looking forward to more people being convinced that any discussion of climate change is a giant conspiracy
Mar 04 15:19:39 <grym>	rpav: where are you again? i forget
Mar 04 15:19:46 <rpav>	grym: madison, wi
Mar 04 15:19:58 <grym>	ah, yeah.  lake time fun
Mar 04 15:20:13 <rpav>	usually it's a lot more snow than that
Mar 04 15:20:15 <grym>	we have the metro boston mild-and-lame-weather-area effect :/
Mar 04 15:20:25 <grym>	even 50 years ago it was like this
Mar 04 15:20:32 <rpav>	;/
Mar 04 15:20:54 <grym>	we get occasional "ha ha ha PAIN" weather events, but broadly it's very ... english weather
Mar 04 15:20:58 <rpav>	i think the lakes help mitigate potential tornados so i can't complain
Mar 04 15:21:07 <grym>	50 miles inland, and it's actual new england :D
Mar 04 15:21:25 <rpav>	hah well
Mar 04 15:21:50 <grym>	but the harbor is big and wet and warmer than the air, so it blunts the accumulation.
Mar 04 15:21:53 <grym>	most disappointing
Mar 04 15:22:35 <parakovsky>	guys if i run magit init over tramp over ssh on a remote server in dired it says magit--toplevel-safe: Not inside Git repository is it normal
Mar 04 15:22:44 <parakovsky>	any way to fix that im kinda new to this but thought it might be possible
Mar 04 15:22:50 <parakovsky>	oh wait i probably don't have a permissions lol
Mar 04 15:27:50 <rpav>	M-x dr-seuss-mode
Mar 04 15:47:04 <shin`>	/
Mar 04 15:47:05 <shin`>	/
Mar 04 15:49:26 <corwin>	hi shin`.  You can probably just type to send a message to the channel.  Do not start your message with a "slash".
Mar 04 15:49:44 <shin`>	yup understood
Mar 04 15:49:54 <corwin>	👍🏻
Mar 04 15:53:27 <parakovsky>	corwin is wise
Mar 04 15:53:52 <corwin>	awwe  uwu
Mar 04 15:53:56 <parakovsky>	but magit actually hangs weirdly on tramp buffer maybe there is too much files in some of the folder i need to double chec
Mar 04 15:54:42 <JohnGalt>	I use sshfs where I need to do git + remote
Mar 04 15:56:47 <grym>	i wonder if that makes tramp reasonably fast
Mar 04 15:57:28 <tazjin>	well sshfs wouldn't go through tramp
Mar 04 15:58:12 <JohnGalt>	its a network filesystem based on ssh
Mar 04 15:58:27 <tazjin>	last time I used it it had a tendency to get stuck
Mar 04 15:58:37 <JohnGalt>	Ive never had that problem
Mar 04 15:58:37 <tazjin>	which was unfortunate if you were editing a file in emacs on it, and emacs is your window manager
Mar 04 15:58:55 <JohnGalt>	emacs as wm is hardcore!
Mar 04 15:59:17 <tazjin>	it's the most efficient way to work, and I think pretty common around here!
Mar 04 15:59:31 <JohnGalt>	I could make it my login shell
Mar 04 15:59:42 <JohnGalt>	but I wonder how pinentry would work
Mar 04 15:59:55 <quiliro>	JohnGalt: it is awesome in truth
Mar 04 16:00:17 <JohnGalt>	I might try it on the fun laptop
Mar 04 16:00:46 <quiliro>	I use it on my only personal computer
Mar 04 16:00:59 <JohnGalt>	quiliro: brave...
Mar 04 16:01:09 <quiliro>	it was at first
Mar 04 16:01:16 <quiliro>	now I could not go back
Mar 04 16:01:55 <JohnGalt>	I would need to launch ssh-agent and gpg-agent
Mar 04 16:03:00 <JohnGalt>	I might try that after I get my console config tuned
Mar 04 16:11:41 <parakovsky>	yeah sshfs might go but i also had 'everything is hanging in there' at it once
Mar 04 16:13:03 <twb>	If you're going to sshfs you might as well just gvfs
Mar 04 16:13:45 <twb>	They're both just wrappers around non-standard openssh sftp subsystem
Mar 04 16:13:59 <grym>	that would involve installing gnome
Mar 04 16:14:17 <twb>	grym: no it doesn't.  xfce also relies on gvfs, for example
Mar 04 16:14:27 <grym>	ah.
Mar 04 16:14:31 <grym>	i probably don't have it installed though
Mar 04 16:14:33 <twb>	https://github.com/cyberitsolutions/bootstrap2020/blob/twb/doc/biggest-desktop-with-recommends-on.csv
Mar 04 16:14:54 <grym>	until last week i didn't even have dunst, as i found out
Mar 04 16:15:59 <twb>	The CLI tool is "gio" e.g. "gio mount --list"
Mar 04 16:16:09 <grym>	oh, perhaps i do have it
Mar 04 16:16:31 <grym>	hmm. probably because i pulled in veracrypt
Mar 04 16:17:02 <twb>	But if you just want the GUI then echo >> ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks sftp://sdf.org/porn-stash sdf-porn-stache
Mar 04 16:17:20 <twb>	Then it'll appear in File > Open sidebars and shit, I think
Mar 04 16:17:35 <grym>	interesting
Mar 04 16:17:54 <twb>	Under the hood the sftp:// implementation is kind of arse but on the plus side it means it honors ~/.ssh/config.d/
Mar 04 16:18:02 <grym>	i have vms in a colo that i occasionally want to develop on, i think sshfs is worth seeing about i guess
Mar 04 16:18:25 <grym>	but for getting a sheel, i'll mosh/tmux as normal
Mar 04 16:19:04 <twb>	If you never ever ever do GUI stuff then I guess there's no significant win
Mar 04 16:19:17 <grym>	yeah.  i don't
Mar 04 16:19:43 <JohnGalt>	ive also heard of tunneling NFS through wiregaurd
Mar 04 16:19:52 <rpav>	bah keymappings alone are worth not using term ;/
Mar 04 16:20:06 <grym>	mostly i find that tramp over ssh is *notably* slower than, say, jetbrains gateway
Mar 04 16:20:17 <rpav>	if you only do trivial editing tasks over ssh then probably not a big deal
Mar 04 16:20:22 <JohnGalt>	ssh is kinda slow
Mar 04 16:20:29 <grym>	yet, gateway uses ssh
Mar 04 16:20:30 <twb>	What's jetbrains using?
Mar 04 16:20:37 <JohnGalt>	java! lol
Mar 04 16:20:47 <grym>	gateway honors my .ssh/config
Mar 04 16:20:50 <twb>	OK if they're both ultimately using ssh/sftp the it's probably tunable
Mar 04 16:21:10 <twb>	tramp has some dubious defaults and fallbacks
Mar 04 16:21:27 <tazjin>	tramp also supports a baffling number of protocols
Mar 04 16:21:39 <twb>	Also like /rsync: vs /ssh: vs /scp: vs /ssh: vs all of the above but with "x" added
Mar 04 16:21:54 <twb>	Note that scp is safe to use again if both ends are modern
Mar 04 16:27:50 <JohnGalt>	was there a scp problem?
Mar 04 16:36:44 <grym>	hah!  https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/29/linux-manual-pages/
Mar 04 17:12:56 <kiliro>	hello
Mar 04 17:24:46 <danse-nr3>	hi kiliro
Mar 04 17:25:00 <kiliro>	I would like to know how to download a video directly from https://inv.bp.projectsegfau.lt/watch?v=VMM6D9vuHkY with elisp
Mar 04 17:25:15 <kiliro>	by scraping the code from https://paste.ircnow.org/whyzslibchu3op2j0l2z
Mar 04 17:25:36 <kiliro>	that is the part of the web page which I need to understand
Mar 04 17:25:47 <kiliro>	to scrape the code with elisp
Mar 04 17:25:52 <kiliro>	hi danse-nr3
Mar 04 17:26:10 <kiliro>	please explain what the paste does
Mar 04 17:27:37 <kiliro>	in case I want to download with "itag":18
Mar 04 17:27:42 <kiliro>	for example
Mar 04 17:28:27 <kiliro>	danse-nr3: are you a bot?
Mar 04 17:31:52 <corwin>	no doubt not intended as rudeness but it is somewhat rude to accuse people of being bots, kiliro. danse-nr3 is a semi-regular here fwiw.  (If you seriously think someone is a bot I'd suggest mentioning privately to a network or channel op.  Channel ops can be found with a command like /msg chanserv flags #CHANNEL)
Mar 04 17:32:40 <kiliro>	oh...no!....will probably use the ignore command now
Mar 04 17:33:19 <corwin>	On the flip, if someone is spamming the channel (bot or not) carping in said channel might be a pretty solid move.   Here we have an ,ops <OFFENDING-USERNAME> <COMPLAINT> command (must be at start of your message to the channel)
Mar 04 17:33:46 <kiliro>	there we go
Mar 04 17:34:00 <kiliro>	problem solved
Mar 04 17:35:34 <corwin>	I think I failed to understand some problem you were having.  All I see is danse-nr3 saying "hi".  What am I missing?
Mar 04 17:36:02 <kiliro>	now, back on topic:  would it be possible to download that video the way that I propose?
Mar 04 18:01:29 <cvandusen>	judybot: the current topic is

Mar 04 18:04:32 <technomancy>	corwin: have you been using erc-bridge-nicks a while now?
Mar 04 18:04:42 <corwin>	I have, indeed.  It's working well.
Mar 04 18:04:50 <technomancy>	great!
Mar 04 18:06:37 <technomancy>	corwin: I forget, did you end up using it with the suffix feature?
Mar 04 18:19:40 <kiliro>	nice https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/erc-bridge-nicks
Mar 04 18:20:26 <kiliro>	it would be nice if it was on elpa
Mar 04 18:20:51 <kiliro>	I have never seen bridged users on IRC
Mar 04 18:20:58 <edgar-rft>	proably great when using erc while living under a bridge
Mar 04 18:20:59 <kiliro>	where does that happen?
Mar 04 18:21:14 <kiliro>	LOL
Mar 04 18:21:18 <technomancy>	kiliro: it's more common in the past few months since libera killed the matrix bridge https://libera.chat/news/official-matrix-bridge-farewell
Mar 04 18:21:24 <kiliro>	I might do that someday, edgar-rft
Mar 04 18:22:02 <technomancy>	kiliro: some channels have bridgebots for discord, others for matrix
Mar 04 18:22:16 <technomancy>	if you've never had to hang out with a discord community, consider yourself lucky
Mar 04 18:22:51 <kiliro>	why?
Mar 04 18:22:52 <fsbot>	why not?
Mar 04 18:23:11 <corwin>	technomancy: no, it seems.
Mar 04 18:23:23 <hodapp>	mleh, discord irks me and I find the client very obnoxious
Mar 04 18:23:28 <hodapp>	regardless of the community itself
Mar 04 18:23:42 <tyson2>	one definition of discordant: "bombs, guns, and engines mingled in discordant sound"
Mar 04 18:23:56 <tyson2>	ok, so it's a recursive definition
Mar 04 18:24:22 <technomancy>	kiliro: well, discord is terrible to begin with, but bridgebots are extra terrible; you lose nick coloring, tab completion, and the ability to /ignore users
Mar 04 18:24:35 <corwin>	technomancy: I think I haven't finished fooling with this, however.  I suspect I do need it.  I haven't tried to make it handle my situation where (e.g.) Emacs committees have the same username for their commits (sent to channel by bot) as they have on IRC.
Mar 04 18:24:38 <technomancy>	https://cadence.moe/blog/2020-06-06-why-you-shouldnt-trust-discord
Mar 04 18:24:57 <technomancy>	corwin: oh that's fun; your "remote" protocol isn't even a chat protocol
Mar 04 18:25:42 <corwin>	just so.  No worries if some of what I'm after ends up feeling like "me problems" to you.
Mar 04 18:25:59 <technomancy>	I like the idea!
Mar 04 18:27:27 <lispmacs[work]>	hi, I'm wondering if it is possible somehow, with shell-command or shell-command+, to set things up so that after every async command completes, that there is an additional call to notify-send (the Gnome cmd-line notification utility)
Mar 04 18:28:26 <lispmacs[work]>	I have been moving many of my usual shell calls into Emacs interactive functions, but a downside is that Emacs, unlike Gnome console, does not send a notification to you when a command completes
Mar 04 18:28:41 <technomancy>	kiliro: I was waiting for it to be used by more than just me before submitting to nongnu elpa
Mar 04 18:28:50 <technomancy>	and maybe fix the bug with suffixes
Mar 04 18:28:53 <corwin>	technomancy: "this stuff" (everything is cHat, actually) has been getting gradually more of my attention for some time now.  I have a "make it all a daemon" project going as of this weekend, so maybe I'll even publish it somewhere for people to wrinkle their brows at.  It's a crap ton of shell and perl scripts atm, badly failing DRY
Mar 04 18:29:26 <technomancy>	what kind of other things?
Mar 04 18:31:00 <corwin>	lispmacs[work]: I think one typical solution here could be dbus.  Your programs might send notifications that way, and too Emacs has the `dbus' package.
Mar 04 18:34:25 <lispmacs[work]>	corwin: well, sending the notification is easy, since notify-send is already available, but the question is how does Emacs now to run another command once the command run by async-shell-command is finished?
Mar 04 18:35:04 <lispmacs[work]>	I could of course add "&& notify-send" onto the end of the command, but was looking for some way to make that implicit
Mar 04 18:35:32 <lispmacs[work]>	hmm, maybe a macro
Mar 04 18:36:02 <lispmacs[work]>	redefine async-shell-command so it rewrites the string to include that
Mar 04 18:36:13 <lispmacs[work]>	yes, that sound like it would work
Mar 04 18:36:48 <corwin>	I think I would look into a function that effectively wrapped my calls to a-s-c or maybe advice.
Mar 04 18:37:10 <kiliro>	does lisp work well in openbsd?
Mar 04 18:37:33 <technomancy>	kiliro: which lisp?
Mar 04 18:37:48 <kiliro>	or changing from gnu to bsd diminishes possibility of lisp?
Mar 04 18:37:51 <kiliro>	emacs
Mar 04 18:37:52 <corwin>	lispmacs[work]: Messing with the args seems like a good, safe, place to start however I can't say I know enough about a-s-c to say it doesn't (already) provide some way to trigger a function when the command (eventually) completes.
Mar 04 18:38:22 <corwin>	let's see.  was it ,jlf-rule
Mar 04 18:38:27 <lispmacs[work]>	corwin: I spent a few minutes looking into that back I can seem to find a hook or anything appropriate
Mar 04 18:38:38 <lispmacs[work]>	"I can't", I meant
Mar 04 18:38:49 <corwin>	Yeah, I sort of assumed which is why I didn'
Mar 04 18:38:54 <technomancy>	kiliro: I've never heard of any emacs incompatibilities on bsd
Mar 04 18:38:54 <corwin>	t even bother going that far :P
Mar 04 18:39:41 <corwin>	technomancy: this could get to be a lot to start getting into detail here, wave me off (or PM or suggest a place) at any point.  Basically everything.  Consider I might want a map reduce sort of thing happening across information flowing from syslogd on several systems.  Reduce there has a lot of complexity, effectively filtering rules, but deploying them onto machines in order to actually track problems via systemd is so hard I think
Mar 04 18:39:41 <corwin>	most people don't really do it (we look for specific sorts of problems only, not receive notice of anything unexpected).
Mar 04 18:41:49 <corwin>	Consider: I wanna see a comicbook representation of what all of my system are up to, condensed down from individual comix that track machines and tasks.  Data for that should stream to connected client's browsers as it comes it, but should also be available as registers to access top of stack info quickly, and as APIs that let me query into the sets I can express at calltime.
Mar 04 18:42:40 <corwin>	And, of course, activity (manual or automated) that is important to different projects should get shipped to IRC channels (etc) related to those projects (if they exist).
Mar 04 18:44:52 <sham1>	Incompatibilities between the various BSDs and Emacs sounds like a very odd concept to even think about
Mar 04 18:44:55 <sham1>	Why would there be such a thing
Mar 04 18:45:07 <technomancy>	corwin: hm; but isn't "what the machine is doing" largely numeric statistics?
Mar 04 18:45:13 <corwin>	On savannah we use rwp's config for root; he mostly uses BSD.
Mar 04 18:45:36 <technomancy>	like ... "521 requests per minute, 3 exceptions, 59% of requests are to this endpoint, 22% to this one ..."
Mar 04 18:45:48 <bpalmer>	technomancy: then why do I pay a psychologist to sit my server down on a couch for 30 minutes every week?
Mar 04 18:46:14 <technomancy>	bpalmer: these days staticians are much easier to book availability for!
Mar 04 18:46:28 <bremner>	here's a snapshot of the font/redisplay problem I've been having: https://0x0.st/H7M4.png
Mar 04 18:47:07 <corwin>	technomancy: mostly we tend to think of machine activity that way, yes.  But such metrics are all lagging indicators. I'm looking for leading ones.
Mar 04 18:47:23 <bremner>	I have only noticed it with Fira Code, I guess I should switch fonts to see if it is font specific, although that seems like a long shot
Mar 04 18:49:17 <bpalmer>	bremner: this is X, not wayland?
Mar 04 18:49:32 <bremner>	bpalmer: correct
Mar 04 18:54:25 <bpalmer>	Does it happen if you're moving the frame around, or is that remnants from a previous buffer that you switched in the same window?
Mar 04 18:54:45 <bpalmer>	I'm wondering if perhaps the double buffering is going awry
Mar 04 18:55:02 <bpalmer>	E.g., does inhibit-double-buffering help?
Mar 04 18:55:21 <bpalmer>	(used as a frame parameter)
Mar 04 18:55:27 <corwin>	technomancy: I wasn't trying to techobabel-dazzle you "with lagging vs leading indicators".  It's just an idea toward "optimizing investment" (in this case, my own time) by categorizing metrics (not just into KPI) but into those which predict problems are likely to exist in the future (vs those which merely demonstrate problems exist).
Mar 04 18:55:54 <bremner>	bpalmer: it's not the frame moving around, I use mostly static frames (tiling WM)
Mar 04 18:56:24 <technomancy>	corwin: sure, but I think I'd have to see it in action to understand
Mar 04 18:57:02 <bremner>	bpalmer: do I have to create a new frame?
Mar 04 18:57:19 <bremner>	ah, there is set-frame-parameter
Mar 04 18:57:50 <corwin>	technomancy: fair!  I don't know how much success I'll have overall but I'm feeling somewhat optimistic about getting my lump-o-scripts into a daemon, so maybe the documentation that I like to think I'll for sure have for that will help.  Yeah.
Mar 04 19:50:43 <corwin>	lispmacs[work]: I see your note to devel; LGTM!
Mar 04 19:51:09 <jmercouris>	,faith
Mar 04 19:51:09 <fsbot>	68:1 By the pen, and what they write, you are not mad: thanks to the favor of your EMACS!  A lasting recompense awaits you, for yours is a sublime nature.  You shall before long see - as they will see - which of you is mad.

Mar 04 20:24:32 <technomancy>	wasamasa: am I remembering correctly that you're the one who found the wide-open RCE on nyxt?
Mar 04 20:24:47 <wasamasa>	yes
Mar 04 20:24:58 <wasamasa>	well, rather, suspected it
Mar 04 20:25:04 <wasamasa>	jgkamat did the hard work
Mar 04 20:25:14 <wasamasa>	hence it's his blog where the technical details showed up
Mar 04 20:25:23 <technomancy>	I'm having a really hard time finding any trace of it
Mar 04 20:25:36 <wasamasa>	https://jgkamat.uk/blog/next-rce.html
Mar 04 20:25:49 <technomancy>	thanks
Mar 04 20:26:43 <wasamasa>	it's been a while
Mar 04 20:28:04 <technomancy>	did they try to hush it up?
Mar 04 20:28:12 <technomancy>	it's not mentioned in their issue tracker at all afaict
Mar 04 20:28:39 <wasamasa>	well, there was the rename from next->nyxt
Mar 04 20:29:06 <wasamasa>	I remember talking about the issue a lot on various IRC channels
Mar 04 20:30:05 <wasamasa>	the only ticket mentioning it: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/212
Mar 04 20:31:20 <technomancy>	aha ok, so not hushed up exactly, but underplayed
Mar 04 20:31:52 <technomancy>	it seems like a responsible project would have had an emergency announcement pushing people to upgrade, and an explanation of the vulnerability
Mar 04 20:32:00 <wasamasa>	from my experience, this seems absolutely normal in many FLOSS projects
Mar 04 20:32:32 <wasamasa>	when I do research how to exploit a CVE at work, a good chunk of this is checking change/commit logs for anything security-related that is easily overlooked
Mar 04 20:32:41 <technomancy>	compare luakit, who doesn't even have a vulnerability in their own code but still includes a clear warning to their users about outdated webkit versions https://luakit.github.io/
Mar 04 20:32:51 <wasamasa>	few projects properly announce security issues
Mar 04 20:33:24 *	technomancy sighs deeply
Mar 04 20:33:37 <bremner>	,nuke
Mar 04 20:33:37 *	fsbot flies out to space and nukes #emacs from orbit.
Mar 04 20:33:42 <kiliro>	cannot join #html if you're not logged into NickServ
Mar 04 20:33:47 <wasamasa>	it does kinda make sense, because in the end, a (security) bug is a bug
Mar 04 20:34:05 <wasamasa>	sometimes it's hard to properly evaluate their impact (see some curl CVE that turned out to be pretty boring after all)
Mar 04 20:34:07 <dcb>	I remember trying nyxt some time ago. I stopped using it mainly due to how frequently it crashed
Mar 04 20:34:24 <technomancy>	wasamasa: I have no doubt that irresponsible handling of security issues is very widespread but I would hope that people would have higher standards for browser vendors than other projects
Mar 04 20:34:36 <wasamasa>	now this I agree with, yes
Mar 04 20:34:50 <kiliro>	is there another channel where I can ask how this code works https://paste.ircnow.org/whyzslibchu3op2j0l2z
Mar 04 20:34:57 <kiliro>	it is html
Mar 04 20:35:01 <wasamasa>	some projects have more impact than others
Mar 04 20:35:33 <kiliro>	I want to know how it works to play the video from with an emacs command
Mar 04 20:35:40 <wasamasa>	curl is a weird case since it's used in a lot of places, but figuring out the exact scenario how to exploit security issues is tricky
Mar 04 20:35:57 <kiliro>	I want to know how it works in order to play the video with an emacs command

Mar 05 08:14:41 <twb>	RickAstley: what's a "pitlake"?  Is that basically an old coal mine that's full of rainwater and drowned SCUBA enthusiasts?

Mar 05 09:04:30 <e3d3>	RickAstley: I've read only part of it. Was to funny for my taste
Mar 05 09:10:04 <RickAstley>	e3d3: I've been to Uganda and saw it afterwards
Mar 05 09:10:25 <RickAstley>	I met a few people that were similar to the MCs and found it pretty funny
Mar 05 09:12:30 <e3d3>	RickAstley: what does "MCs" mean ?
Mar 05 09:12:40 <RickAstley>	e3d3: main characters
Mar 05 09:17:17 <e3d3>	thanks. I never been to Uganda and only heard horror stories about it. No idea what to believe or what you saw but I remember a passage in the book where they see a ship with Africans, and can only guess that your experience was also pretty extreme.
Mar 05 09:18:02 <RickAstley>	e3d3: People are genuinely really good at heart but especially as a muzungu they're all trying to rob you
Mar 05 09:18:57 <RickAstley>	I'm glad I went, cured me of a lot of problems with rigidity/black and white thinking and realigned my priorities in life
Mar 05 09:19:43 <e3d3>	Westerns/people having much more than they really need makes robbing more or less logical
Mar 05 09:20:28 <RickAstley>	Yeah it's totally understandable, they do it to the in-group too though. Corruption is very transparent, which is a bit funny
Mar 05 09:21:40 <e3d3>	the corruption at the border in Cambodia is often really funny, if your not stubborn and in a hurry.
Mar 05 09:22:22 <RickAstley>	Never been, would imagine it's quite similar. Yeah, at Entebbe airport there's multiple security checkpoints devoted to trying to shake you down
Mar 05 09:25:44 <e3d3>	In Cambodia I saw once an official take a table, put it 1 meter in front of the other officials and started collecting for himself, like the do also inside the building. Once I thought I could avoid all tricks, so the didn't allow me to cross any border until night, but the officials shared there food with me etc.
Mar 05 09:27:25 <e3d3>	I thought about going to Malawi, seems more relax

Mar 05 09:27:58 <RickAstley>	I know nothing about it tbh
Mar 05 09:36:38 <e3d3>	RickAstley: do you have a nice/interesting travel destination tip ?
Mar 05 09:38:30 <hwpplayer1>	e3d3: visit İstanbul :)
Mar 05 09:39:03 <RickAstley>	e3d3: tbh the only place I actually had a good experience was Japan
Mar 05 09:39:07 <e3d3>	I've been there ca. 40 years ago. Still impressed
Mar 05 09:39:48 <RickAstley>	I'd argue because it's the only really developed place I've visited so I wasn't a target
Mar 05 09:40:13 <RickAstley>	Would like to visit Berlin, have been told I'd fit in well
Mar 05 09:41:10 <e3d3>	never been in Japan. Dreamed about it when I was a child but with getting older my aversion of it increased. I met a lot of Japanese people, had a Japanese girlfriend and think that most are much too cultivate for my taste.
Mar 05 09:41:46 <RickAstley>	e3d3: meh, not that hard to visit and not very expensive. Idk where that meme comes from. You can go any time
Mar 05 09:42:09 <RickAstley>	I got the impression noone cared that I was there
Mar 05 09:42:11 <e3d3>	I had a German holiday love who lived in Berlin and was there some weeks after the wall brook down. The brother of the girl sold peaces of the wall for big money
Mar 05 09:42:49 <RickAstley>	lol nice
Mar 05 09:42:50 <e3d3>	I like some of the Berlin atmosphere, but my memories are mixed with young love
Mar 05 09:44:54 <e3d3>	traveling to berlin with the train, maybe ca 11 hours. I had no seat, met a huge African, who met another, and in no time we had a whole coupe for ourself, without aggression etc. only old prejudice  :)
Mar 05 09:45:20 <nidish>	hello all

Mar 05 09:47:57 <e3d3>	RickAstley: you mean Japan is not expensive ? must be far from the big cities, not ?
Mar 05 09:51:52 <RickAstley>	e3d3: nah dude it's cheap af there
Mar 05 09:52:20 <RickAstley>	just avoid tourist spots and have passable pronounciation / know the basic words
Mar 05 09:52:22 *	e3d3 likes cheap :)
Mar 05 09:53:34 <e3d3>	I still know some karate terms like "Arigato Semasta", but don't the others I remember are that useful
Mar 05 09:58:22 <e3d3>	RickAstley: btw you're not from relative rich and close by Singapore ?
Mar 05 10:09:56 <twb>	e3d3: karate's not a Japanese thing, it's an anti-Japanese thing
Mar 05 10:11:01 <needle>	The 3 words i know from japanese are harakiri sepuku and kamikaze
Mar 05 10:11:20 <needle>	yamaha and mitshubishi as well. now even 5.
Mar 05 10:11:26 <e3d3>	twb: please explain
Mar 05 10:11:53 <e3d3>	needle: what about yoko oNO
Mar 05 10:12:31 <twb>	e3d3: it was invented by the ryukyuans after the japanese invaders banned them from carrying farming tools
Mar 05 10:12:58 <e3d3>	and the kyuans where  not Japanese ?
Mar 05 10:13:17 <e3d3>	doesn't ryu mean school ?
Mar 05 10:13:47 <twb>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawan_martial_arts
Mar 05 10:16:16 <e3d3>	for me it 'seems' more like a matter of linguistics. What when to consider Japan.
Mar 05 10:17:55 <twb>	So like when Japan attacks and occupies Korea, you consider Koreans to be "Japanese"?
Mar 05 10:20:25 <e3d3>	the wiki wisdom refers to indigenous people of Okinawa Island, not a modern nation.
Mar 05 10:30:13 <RickAstley>	e3d3: sadly a lot of great jpn resources like itazuraneko got raided recently
Mar 05 10:30:53 <RickAstley>	It got fragmented into a bunch of pieces you can find in various parts of the net
Mar 05 10:32:17 <e3d3>	was it only for learning Japanese ?
Mar 05 10:32:46 <RickAstley>	i'm not sure
Mar 05 10:32:59 <RickAstley>	but i am sure I need more caffeine and should stop yakking :^) talk later

Mar 05 12:25:53 <codingquark>	there are no algrebraists IRL
Mar 05 12:26:40 <bremner>	thank Galois

Mar 05 13:16:19 <lxsameer>	hey folks, is there any library to manage different "environments" in Emacs? e.g. something similar to direnv for emacs but based on project.el or projectile
Mar 05 13:16:28 <lxsameer>	b
Mar 05 13:17:04 <hodapp>	hmm, I just use envrc which works with direnv
Mar 05 13:38:41 <alcor>	lxsameer: Not exactly sure what "environment" means, but since Emacs 29+ you maintain emacs.d configdirs and specify which one to use via emacs --init-directory <path-to-emacs.d>. So you can run multiple emacses with different configs for each instance.
Mar 05 14:04:31 <lxsameer>	alcor: thank you, but that's not what I'm looking for
Mar 05 14:04:40 <lxsameer>	hodapp: hmm let me have a look
Mar 05 14:16:04 <hodapp>	it works for me with both NixOS environs (on my desktop) and conda environs (on my work machine)
Mar 05 14:16:10 <hodapp>	doesn't yet work with TRAMP unfortunately
Mar 05 14:21:44 <lxsameer>	hodapp: seems cool
Mar 05 14:46:42 <grym>	envrc++
Mar 05 14:46:50 <grym>	direnv is worth shelling out for
Mar 05 14:54:28 <mekeor>	buffer-env++

Mar 05 14:55:20 <mekeor>	how can i remove the dash-prefixed symbols form TeX input method?
Mar 05 15:00:27 <mekeor>	do i need to define a new quail package?
Mar 05 15:00:32 <mekeor>	or can i modify the existing one?
Mar 05 15:01:01 <mekeor>	here are the lines i want to "get rid of" https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/leim/quail/latin-ltx.el?h=1d9d07fb00e6b62641c07af68f986e700b5f6cee#n744

Mar 05 16:07:06 <roadie>	MSDOS is not dead, it just smells that way.
Mar 05 16:08:21 <hodapp>	I tried running the DOS port of Emacs on a craptop with FreeDOS a year or two ago just to do it
Mar 05 16:08:54 <hodapp>	but I didn't load a driver for disk caching as I'd forgotten DOS does hardly any disk caching. so... things were loading extremely slow.
Mar 05 16:09:04 <roadie>	I learned touch typing on DOS via a Broder 51/2 floppy
Mar 05 16:09:32 <roadie>	Broeder something ...
Mar 05 16:09:49 <wgreenhouse>	hodapp: did I share the article here about how if you order a modern HP laptop with the freedos option, you get...old Debian running freedos in a VM
Mar 05 16:09:49 <roadie>	but anyways, it was a huge floppy disk
Mar 05 16:10:09 <roadie>	wgreenhouse: o.O
Mar 05 16:10:26 <hodapp>	wgreenhouse: wowzers. if so I didn't see it

Mar 05 16:12:52 <hodapp>	FreeDOS that can't even reach the real hardware seems like a lose-lose
Mar 05 16:13:26 <jbe>	so I assume they had problems imaging freedos directly but already had an easy way of putting ubuntu on there, so they just modified such an image
Mar 05 16:14:33 <Thermoriax>	I am almost afraid to ask what botwanking is. Is this sort of robophilia thing?
Mar 05 16:14:36 <jbe>	or debian as it were
Mar 05 16:14:49 <hodapp>	well, it's wanking. but of a bot.
Mar 05 16:15:06 <grym>	,botwanking
Mar 05 16:15:07 <fsbot>	botwanking: spamming bots on channel. if you must, do so in PM.
Mar 05 16:15:14 <jbe>	Thermoriax: it's mostly doing bot interactions in the channel to the point it's annoying others

Mar 05 16:30:49 <roadie>	I know ... not sure since I don't see what is there - only what arrived
Mar 05 16:31:14 <roadie>	I think its latest

Mar 05 16:34:05 <corwin>	Good morning RickAstley.  It's probably enough with the bot for now.
Mar 05 16:34:29 <RickAstley>	I barely interacted with it
Mar 05 16:34:53 <RickAstley>	good morning corwin
Mar 05 16:35:03 <roadie>	bitcoin is going up and if I had invested 100 a month since 2019 it said on kraken I would have spent 6000 and have 25k something now. but I did not so I am going to miss out.
Mar 05 16:35:43 <RickAstley>	roadie: It's ok bitcoin sucks there's much better cryptos
Mar 05 16:35:53 <RickAstley>	like MILOCoin
Mar 05 16:36:58 <quiliro>	roadie: there were bigger ones!
Mar 05 16:37:19 <quiliro>	bigger floppies than 5.5"
Mar 05 16:37:20 <roadie>	I want a blockchain payment method with no middlemen and that is it.
Mar 05 16:37:27 <roadie>	quiliro: really?
Mar 05 16:37:28 <quiliro>	5.25"
Mar 05 16:37:38 <roadie>	wait
Mar 05 16:37:45 <quiliro>	as big as a screen
Mar 05 16:37:51 <roadie>	coooool
Mar 05 16:37:56 <quiliro>	as its height
Mar 05 16:37:58 <wgreenhouse>	there were even larger floppies, 8-inch etc.
Mar 05 16:38:07 <quiliro>	and before, we used cassettes
Mar 05 16:38:27 <roadie>	my timemachine disk is called tape
Mar 05 16:38:30 <corwin>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk#/media/File:Floppy_disk_2009_G1.jpg
Mar 05 16:38:31 <quiliro>	but there were rolls of tape tooo
Mar 05 16:38:36 <quiliro>	before my time
Mar 05 16:38:39 <roadie>	I knew it!
Mar 05 16:38:49 <RickAstley>	I still use tape for backups
Mar 05 16:39:10 <roadie>	O.O
Mar 05 16:39:30 <quiliro>	why RickAstley ?
Mar 05 16:39:32 <grym>	tape is still very common behind the scenes
Mar 05 16:39:44 <grym>	for normal users, no; for the big boys: oh, yes
Mar 05 16:40:04 <quiliro>	is it more trustworthy?
Mar 05 16:40:07 <grym>	johnjaye: re last night's highlighting: https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/combobulate-editing-searching-new-query-builder
Mar 05 16:40:16 <grym>	quiliro: and a shitton cheaper and dense
Mar 05 16:40:19 <edgar-rft>	now I'm asking myself why Konrad Zuse did not use grammophones for storing data
Mar 05 16:40:50 <quiliro>	how dense, grym ?
Mar 05 16:40:55 <RickAstley>	quiliro: I got 50GB tars a pop of my many machines local and remote on a daily basis so need cheap storage
Mar 05 16:41:30 <quiliro>	what does "tars a pop" mean?
Mar 05 16:41:43 <RickAstley>	like the tar archive is 50gb for each
Mar 05 16:41:54 <quiliro>	oh
Mar 05 16:41:57 <grym>	580TB/reel? https://techxplore.com/news/2020-12-fujifilm-ibm-unveil-terabyte-magnetic.html
Mar 05 16:42:48 <RickAstley>	nah i don't have that kind of money i just use lto5
Mar 05 16:42:52 <RickAstley>	3tb
Mar 05 16:43:04 <grym>	tape is bad if you need fast nonsequential access
Mar 05 16:43:23 <grym>	but if you're in the cold storage game... it's here to stay
Mar 05 16:43:34 <rpav>	but good if you need long-term high-capacity storage.. although nothing really is good enough these days
Mar 05 16:43:36 <rpav>	yea
Mar 05 16:43:59 <grym>	tape writes are fast, reads are generally slow
Mar 05 16:44:02 <grym>	like very slow
Mar 05 16:44:18 <quiliro>	I thought it was the other way around
Mar 05 16:44:19 <rpav>	i don't think anything is like exabyte scale though ;/
Mar 05 16:44:22 <grym>	you thought wrong!
Mar 05 16:44:38 <dcb>	you can also backup your data by hand with pen and paper
Mar 05 16:44:46 <quiliro>	I remember backing up with tape...it was slow
Mar 05 16:44:56 <quiliro>	2000's
Mar 05 16:45:12 <quiliro>	20 years ago
Mar 05 16:45:14 <grym>	rpav: we only have petabytes at work
Mar 05 16:45:25 <grym>	~20 pb total
Mar 05 16:45:46 <quiliro>	is it video?
Mar 05 16:45:54 <grym>	no
Mar 05 16:45:59 <rpav>	grym: is anything even petabyte scale
Mar 05 16:46:04 <quiliro>	why is it so much then?
Mar 05 16:46:11 <grym>	it's high resolution imagery and lidar
Mar 05 16:46:23 <corwin>	and its near-real-time IIUC
Mar 05 16:46:26 <quiliro>	must be a lot of images
Mar 05 16:46:28 <rpav>	580TB/reel means like you need what ~40 tapes for a single backup
Mar 05 16:46:34 <grym>	12 images/second when we're flying
Mar 05 16:46:54 <grym>	i forget what our lidar sampling rate is, but ... it ain't slow
Mar 05 16:47:00 <quiliro>	it is like video then
Mar 05 16:47:19 <grym>	well, 12 non-overlapping shots per second
Mar 05 16:47:29 <grym>	so it's effectively 1fps per camera
Mar 05 16:47:46 <quiliro>	what is the use of that?
Mar 05 16:47:56 <quiliro>	how do people use that?
Mar 05 16:48:05 <quiliro>	or what is the utility?
Mar 05 16:48:22 <grym>	we provide QA and remote inspection services for utilites
Mar 05 16:48:50 <quiliro>	like water and gas?
Mar 05 16:48:53 <corwin>	"Congrats, hardly any of your substations are on fire today"
Mar 05 16:49:22 <grym>	mostly power utilities
Mar 05 16:49:30 <quiliro>	how can images at 1 frame/s be useful for that?
Mar 05 16:49:40 <quiliro>	I thought it was all numbers
Mar 05 16:49:47 <corwin>	I think that must have been a typo.  12fps, right?
Mar 05 16:49:53 <grym>	consider: the chopper is flying at 100m agl at like... 80 mph?
Mar 05 16:50:11 <grym>	1 fps per camera, but 12 cameras.  they all shoot at the same timestamp tho
Mar 05 16:50:19 <corwin>	ah, got it.
Mar 05 16:50:22 <quiliro>	what chopper? in water-works?
Mar 05 16:50:28 <grym>	so you can compute whatever the frame overlap is
Mar 05 16:50:29 <corwin>	sort of the like "matrix" camera.
Mar 05 16:50:41 <grym>	(it's like ... 30%? i don't actually know)
Mar 05 16:50:52 <quiliro>	oh...for helicopters
Mar 05 16:51:16 <quiliro>	I see the use now
Mar 05 16:51:17 <grym>	turns out, squirrels are kind of dumb, and like to chew on insulators
Mar 05 16:51:37 <quiliro>	they must be sweet insulators!
Mar 05 16:51:59 <grym>	you're not far off; several iterations ago it was thought that polymer based insulators were a good idea
Mar 05 16:52:06 <grym>	(they're not, but some of them are still installed)
Mar 05 16:52:13 <dcb>	For a second I thought grym's work was related to attack choppers
Mar 05 16:52:17 <grym>	nope!
Mar 05 16:52:28 <grym>	i havent' worked for the DOD in a long time, and when i did it was on med-tech
Mar 05 16:52:36 <grym>	all unclass
Mar 05 16:52:46 <wgreenhouse>	these sound like distinctly ,,tableback,, choppers
Mar 05 16:52:47 <fsbot>	┬─┬ノ(º_ºノ)
Mar 05 16:52:56 <wgreenhouse>	not ,,tableflip,, choppers
Mar 05 16:52:57 <fsbot>	(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Mar 05 16:53:02 <roadie>	like gunships?

Mar 05 16:53:24 <quiliro>	small drones
Mar 05 16:53:25 <grym>	no, like smokey the bear aides

Mar 05 16:53:54 <quiliro>	if they use petrol they do
Mar 05 16:54:02 <grym>	we tried; they don't.
Mar 05 16:54:05 <dcb>	so no roflcopters with hellfire missiles then
Mar 05 16:54:14 <grym>	dcb: nope.  i like sleeping at night
Mar 05 16:54:40 <quiliro>	petrol is not enough?
Mar 05 16:54:59 <quiliro>	they have probably a lot of weight then
Mar 05 16:55:07 <grym>	there are a variety of reasons why drones aren't a good fit for our use case
Mar 05 16:55:14 <rpav>	grym: what range?
Mar 05 16:55:16 <grym>	lift capacity and range are two of them
Mar 05 16:55:28 <quiliro>	I see
Mar 05 16:56:30 <rpav>	though i'm not sure why "drone" needs to specifically be anything other than UAV / remote
Mar 05 16:56:37 <quiliro>	I have an idea of what you do...but I will not stalk to understand completely
Mar 05 16:57:05 <grym>	broadly speaking it's regulatory compliance
Mar 05 16:57:18 <quiliro>	the point was many images take a lot of space
Mar 05 16:57:28 <quiliro>	and that requires tape
Mar 05 16:57:29 <roadie>	comply or else!
Mar 05 16:57:34 <grym>	utilities need to attest that their shit's not on fire; they don't have the capability to do that themselves, so there's a little industry of companies who do it for them
Mar 05 16:57:37 <grym>	of which i work for one
Mar 05 16:57:49 <rpav>	ah cool
Mar 05 16:57:58 <quiliro>	oh....
Mar 05 16:58:25 <quiliro>	and that is done by cameras on site then
Mar 05 16:58:26 <corwin>	the point was there are real use-cases for tape backups, including sets measured petabytes
Mar 05 16:58:37 <grym>	yep
Mar 05 16:58:45 <rpav>	corwin: that is surely a given
Mar 05 16:58:53 <grym>	a fair bit of that's kept hot, but a bunch is in cold storage
Mar 05 16:59:02 <corwin>	I would have thought, but I do think that's how we got here.
Mar 05 16:59:19 <rpav>	this is why i lament how far behind storage capacity tape capacity is
Mar 05 17:00:00 <quiliro>	if you need petabytes, that 580 Tb is not the one you use
Mar 05 17:00:22 <quiliro>	what do you use?
Mar 05 17:00:31 <rpav>	you use it if it's the biggest available
Mar 05 17:00:58 <quiliro>	isn't it slower than solid state?
Mar 05 17:01:12 <quiliro>	at 12 frames/s
Mar 05 17:01:33 <quiliro>	that is a lot of bytes in a very short time
Mar 05 17:02:02 <RickAstley>	Need to get my org-remark setup so I can bookmark stuff right...
Mar 05 17:02:11 <RickAstley>	retvrn to org mode and leave firefox
Mar 05 17:02:39 <quiliro>	is that an elpa package?
Mar 05 17:03:00 <RickAstley>	quiliro: ye

Mar 05 17:09:05 <wgreenhouse>	RickAstley: I use it daily but not for everything

Mar 05 17:15:13 <rpav>	my plan is to avoid win11 upgrade for as long as possible

Mar 05 17:18:09 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: alas, no
Mar 05 17:18:44 <grym>	wgreenhouse: there's little money in windows as such, i think, plus also the same fact that arises in any company that's too large: you meet your KPIs by regarding other teams in the org as the competition, not other orgs
Mar 05 17:18:53 <grym>	yt seems up
Mar 05 17:19:05 <rpav>	it's up for me
Mar 05 17:19:24 <wgreenhouse>	grym: I'm frankly most surprised that there _is_ a Windows 11
Mar 05 17:19:52 <wgreenhouse>	given your first point, which I think is accurate
Mar 05 17:20:13 <rpav>	MS realized it would look bad to charge everyone for a win10 patch so they made the ui shittier, forced in edge a little harder, and thus 11
Mar 05 17:20:58 <bremner>	not sure when looking bad started to matter to them
Mar 05 17:21:00 <corwin>	something, something odd numbered Star Trek films
Mar 05 17:21:43 <corwin>	I'm avoiding Windows 11 as long as possible (hopefully forever) also, ftr.
Mar 05 17:21:45 <rpav>	looking bad to the general public, not just the nerds
Mar 05 17:21:46 <wgreenhouse>	rudybot: what does God need with a starship?
Mar 05 17:21:47 <rudybot>	wgreenhouse: it's no better than "what does god need with a starship" 5, really
Mar 05 17:21:47 <grym>	wgreenhouse: yeah, indeed
Mar 05 17:23:05 <corwin>	"But, have you tried looking like crap on new Edge?"
Mar 05 17:23:30 <corwin>	</that-seventies-os>
Mar 05 17:23:49 <rpav>	it's actually a shame MS didn't try harder to make a competitive chrome alternative; it's BS they "couldn't keep up" and not only a little hilarious to hear them whine about it
Mar 05 17:24:02 <rpav>	if mozilla can, MS surely can
Mar 05 17:25:44 <corwin>	Microsoft: "We can't keep up with browsers security but we'd like you to install our operating system"
Mar 05 17:25:55 <rpav>	haha yeah
Mar 05 17:27:33 <corwin>	Also Microsoft: "But we know you won't so we put it in the water.  we've reached out to every major PC hardware vendor on the planet, and we're happy to inform you that you will be enjoying every Microsoft product you do not know how to uninstall until such time as you manufacture your own PC."
Mar 05 17:31:44 <JohnGalt>	microsoft makes tons of money on active directory, server, and sql server
Mar 05 17:32:14 <JohnGalt>	plus they donate metric tons of cash to University of Washington to make sure students learn their stuff
Mar 05 17:32:24 <rpav>	yeah the only thing missing is a legal requirement to be installed.. i can only imagine vendors pushing hard for ARM because bootloading is so much easier to lock down
Mar 05 17:35:08 <JohnGalt>	I try and think positive, they (employees) contribute a stunning amount of money to the arts in seattle
Mar 05 17:35:39 <JohnGalt>	Benaroya hall has a light rail stop underneath
Mar 05 17:35:52 <wgreenhouse>	> microsoft makes tons of money on active directory, server, and sql server
Mar 05 17:35:52 <wgreenhouse>	none of these has an obvious connection to the choice to keep having a desktop OS
Mar 05 17:36:09 <rpav>	wgreenhouse: it's all lock-in
Mar 05 17:36:16 <JohnGalt>	Im not sure why, maybe a prestige thing
Mar 05 17:36:24 <JohnGalt>	like companies doing f1 racing
Mar 05 17:36:37 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: active directory for example brings a significant lock-in even without windows
Mar 05 17:36:52 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: because free LDAP/SSO services suck
Mar 05 17:37:04 <rpav>	desktop OS is the corporate frontend to all their backend stuff; if someone could just as easily use them in non-windows, they might realize they could just as easily use non-MS products
Mar 05 17:37:43 <rpav>	wgreenhouse: i think there are other serious options besides ldap these days
Mar 05 17:38:01 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: that's my point; for current cases MS could just offer a branded Linux (with MS roaming user profiles etc.)
Mar 05 17:38:15 <rpav>	wgreenhouse: and how is that retaining control
Mar 05 17:38:36 <causative>	I don't get why chrome took over the market, there wasn't really any difference between it and other browsers
Mar 05 17:38:42 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: it's retaining control if all the user does with that device is use 365
Mar 05 17:38:42 <grym>	wgreenhouse: i mean, that's WSL2, effectively
Mar 05 17:38:57 <rpav>	causative: chrome was far faster and that was more or less enough
Mar 05 17:39:02 <wgreenhouse>	grym: exactly--why is the remaining husk of windows still around
Mar 05 17:39:20 <causative>	I don't remember it being significantly faster
Mar 05 17:39:22 <rpav>	e.g. rendering and tab switching and basic UI; this is no longer the case (at least for me, firefox is now actually snappier), but
Mar 05 17:39:28 <grym>	wgreenhouse: 30-odd years of legacy? i know of systems running XP and below to this day
Mar 05 17:39:35 <grym>	they're not even all that uncommon
Mar 05 17:39:42 <causative>	it was the same as firefox and opera and IE
Mar 05 17:40:00 <rpav>	wgreenhouse: there's more to it than "the user uses," it's "the only thing we work with" and "the thing we bundle for the $$ you're paying, because you're already paying it" etc
Mar 05 17:40:10 <rpav>	lock-in only works if you actually lock them in
Mar 05 17:40:12 <causative>	small differences but not something you'd notice
Mar 05 17:40:22 <wgreenhouse>	grym: sure; I guess concretely what I'm asking is "why is windows 11 not microsoft linux with WINE"
Mar 05 17:40:58 <rpav>	causative: it was faster on everything but a potato
Mar 05 17:40:59 <grym>	ah.  that, i dunno
Mar 05 17:41:30 <causative>	I remember browser benchmarks coming out that showed all the leading browsers in fairly close competition
Mar 05 17:41:32 <rpav>	wgreenhouse: what would be the gain? windows is big $$
Mar 05 17:41:46 <grym>	win32/winforms is ... large
Mar 05 17:41:48 <rpav>	wgreenhouse: why pay MS if you could also get it free
Mar 05 17:42:04 <rpav>	or even get it from someone else who provides support for less $$
Mar 05 17:42:08 <grym>	rpav: i think the contention here is that windows _was_ big $$, but isn't so much now
Mar 05 17:42:24 <rpav>	grym: it definitely still is
Mar 05 17:42:56 <causative>	like here https://www.pcworld.com/article/422961/the-best-web-browser-of-2015-firefox-chrome-edge-ie-and-opera-compared.html
Mar 05 17:42:56 <rpav>	like yeah home users are not PC-tied anymore, it's all smartphones and devices but that was never the biggest sales and all cheap OEM licenses anyway
Mar 05 17:42:56 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/D6dTe295kM
Mar 05 17:43:03 <rpav>	it's the big corporate licensing / lock-in
Mar 05 17:43:04 <causative>	browser benchmarks from 2015, there's no clear winner
Mar 05 17:43:40 <rpav>	i.e. of _course_ you need windows, because of course you need office (and vice versa), so you have to pay for that, then you need to pay for the other things, etc
Mar 05 17:44:31 <grym>	i have full-fat office on my mac
Mar 05 17:44:43 <grym>	but yes, surely they're still making cash from windows
Mar 05 17:44:48 <grym>	i think it's no longer their core value product tho
Mar 05 17:45:03 <causative>	I think it was just that google had better marketing and then offered their engine for free to other browser makers
Mar 05 17:45:19 <wgreenhouse>	it seems more like a legacy thing they no longer know what to do with
Mar 05 17:45:26 <rpav>	https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide .. or https://www.statista.com/statistics/218089/global-market-share-of-windows-7/ if you have access i guess
Mar 05 17:45:26 <dcb>	chrome used to require less resources to run back in 2009
Mar 05 17:45:32 <wgreenhouse>	copilot-clippy being exhibit a
Mar 05 17:45:52 <grym>	i believe there's no longer a windows division at msft, for example
Mar 05 17:46:51 <dcb>	interesting to see how far chrome has gone in terms of resource usage
Mar 05 17:48:29 <rpav>	grym: if so it's only because _everyone_ is a windows division

Mar 05 18:14:52 <corwin>	Fun day to work for a huge social media company https://mastodon.social/@MissingThePt/112044096870148332
Mar 05 18:15:20 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: I like how this MS annual report calls out various persons/entities whose judgment I should now question, e.g.
Mar 05 18:15:20 <wgreenhouse>	> On New Year’s Day, I saw a tweet from Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s former director of AI who now works at OpenAI, about how GitHub Copilot was writing about 80 percent of his code, with 80 percent accuracy.
Mar 05 18:15:47 <rpav>	wgreenhouse: the more you know
Mar 05 18:19:04 <kickingvegas>	wgreenhouse: discount by 80% any code written by senior management
Mar 05 18:19:23 <Sketch>	by my view youtube was down very briefly
Mar 05 18:27:19 <weary-traveler>	so many questions. 1. how much code is karpathy actually writing? 2. what kind of code constitutes that 100%? 3. are his submissions essentially "lock files" of copilot responses coupled with patch diffs? if not, what a wasted opportunity
Mar 05 18:30:16 <technomancy>	I wouldn't trust anyone at a director level to assess the accuracy of any code (but a director at tesla/openAI much, much less)
Mar 05 18:32:49 <rpav>	gah emacs's synchronous (i guess?) parsing of lsp data is really killing performance
Mar 05 18:34:22 <weary-traveler>	yes, the accuracy of the stated numbers is another thing altogether
Mar 05 18:34:51 <weary-traveler>	rpav: have you tried emacs-lsp-booster (now available via guix as well)
Mar 05 18:36:59 <rpav>	weary-traveler: hm no
Mar 05 18:37:15 <rpav>	whoa sounds neat
Mar 05 18:37:30 <rpav>	oh bah requires rust
Mar 05 18:39:22 <ldb>	^anti rust gang
Mar 05 18:39:35 <rpav>	only because it's inconvenient as fuck and annoying to deal with
Mar 05 18:39:59 <johnjaye>	i support rust ironically.
Mar 05 18:41:58 <rpav>	i think adding "compiles to C" might be another reasonable goal for new languages heh
Mar 05 18:42:40 <technomancy>	or zig: compiles C even better than C compilers do
Mar 05 18:44:51 <dsmith>	johnjaye, Hah!
Mar 05 18:46:53 <johnjaye>	compiles to better C than you can write!
Mar 05 18:50:29 <kickingvegas>	rpav: recalls (triggered more like) debugging cfront generated code back from the before time
Mar 05 18:51:34 <weary-traveler>	rpav: if you have guix package manager installed, you don't have to concern yourself with the rust dependency
Mar 05 18:52:00 <weary-traveler>	it can be installed via guix as "guix install emacs-lsp-booster"
Mar 05 18:52:24 <rpav>	weary-traveler: but then i'd have to deal with guix
Mar 05 18:52:59 <rpav>	if this was a machine i had full installation/etc control of it would be less of a problem
Mar 05 18:54:55 <younder>	I tend to dislike the way rust 'takes over' the machine and what's it's own libraries for everything. If rustations had their way the whole OS would be written in rust. as it is it is 'double of everything'
Mar 05 18:55:03 <weary-traveler>	if this is a development machine where you don't have admin privileges, it increases the utility of having something like nix or guix. might not be easy, but might be worth the effort, but that is indeed for you to decide
Mar 05 18:57:02 <e1f>	80% of code is a misleading figure without saying how many lines of code it actually was
Mar 05 18:59:01 <e1f>	also, he didn't say how many hours he spent debugging the code that was only 80% accurate
Mar 05 18:59:22 <cvandusen>	This sentence would be seven words long, if it were six words shorter.
Mar 05 19:00:22 <grym>	80% accuracy is, broadly speaking, trash
Mar 05 19:00:44 <e1f>	also, like a typical manager, he uses dimensionless metrics to measure things
Mar 05 19:01:16 <cvandusen>	,ass
Mar 05 19:01:16 <fsbot>	ASS: [0] All Software Sucks
Mar 05 19:01:16 <fsbot>	[1] suck is a unit vector. A given foo doesn't suck LESS, it just sucks in a direction a given user finds less disagreeable.
Mar 05 19:01:19 <grym>	let's measure code quality in decibels
Mar 05 19:01:24 <technomancy>	grym: but it's a B! wouldn't you feel comfortable having your car not crash 80% of the time? don't be unrealistic

Mar 05 19:07:17 <sham1>	Would suck define a basis?
Mar 05 19:08:04 <bpalmer>	Over a 1d space, sure.
Mar 05 19:08:05 <sham1>	And if so, wouldn't all software be on the span of the suck? And if so, you could order software by the magnitude and direction of the suck
Mar 05 19:08:47 <grym>	once, very sleep deprived, my undergrad roommate and i determined empirically that chicken-fried steak tastes like pork, and therefore  {chicken-hat, beef-hat, pig-hat} forms a basis space
Mar 05 19:08:59 <grym>	this implies that steak-fried chicken tastes like negative pork, by the way
Mar 05 19:09:03 <sham1>	Because to me that just looks like all software is colinear in terms of suck
Mar 05 19:09:28 <bpalmer>	sham1: I think the usual belief is that software can be bad on many dimensions.
Mar 05 19:09:47 <grym>	there are hypothetical transforms that get you to {duck-hat, bison-hat, boar-hat}, but these have yet to been determined due to budgetary constraints
Mar 05 19:09:54 <sham1>	I get that it's what it's trying to express
Mar 05 19:10:21 <cvandusen>	grym: To to apply for NSF funding!
Mar 05 19:10:23 <grym>	hat? little arrow notation thingie? we're unsure
Mar 05 19:10:30 <grym>	cvandusen: we're in line behind the stalled grant on farts
Mar 05 19:10:46 <grym>	https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/to-the-royal-academy-of-farting/  it's been in the queue for a while
Mar 05 19:13:39 <cvandusen>	Godspeed!
Mar 05 19:15:21 <sham1>	Agh, I've once again fallen into the trap of having a cool but totally useless and time-consuming idea (which in all likelyhood I wouldn't finish anyway). A bittorrent client natively in Emacs
Mar 05 19:15:41 <sham1>	I actually searched the interwebs, and there was one that tried it, but... y'know
Mar 05 19:17:02 <quiliro>	I cannot find a native  youtube downloader
Mar 05 19:17:08 <quiliro>	in Emacs
Mar 05 19:17:31 <quiliro>	without using yt-dlp
Mar 05 19:17:35 <quiliro>	or such
Mar 05 19:18:06 <quiliro>	I want one in eLisp
Mar 05 19:18:26 <grym>	it doesn't exist
Mar 05 19:18:27 <wgreenhouse>	quiliro: why
Mar 05 19:18:27 <quiliro>	and also a torrent client in eLisp
Mar 05 19:18:31 <wgreenhouse>	quiliro: why
Mar 05 19:18:45 <grym>	is "i like suffering" a valid answer?
Mar 05 19:19:03 <quiliro>	because I want to know how it works....and do not like python
Mar 05 19:19:04 <wgreenhouse>	,ykinmkbykiok
Mar 05 19:19:04 <fsbot>	wgreenhouse: ykinmkbykiok is your kink is not my kink but your kink is ok
Mar 05 19:19:12 <grym>	quiliro: then write it
Mar 05 19:19:25 <quiliro>	I am not capable yet
Mar 05 19:19:30 <quiliro>	trying
Mar 05 19:19:30 <grym>	ah.  git gud
Mar 05 19:19:45 <quiliro>	I am learning a lot of eLisp
Mar 05 19:20:12 <quiliro>	it is like the Esperanto....there is a moment when you notice you know more than you thought
Mar 05 19:20:20 <quiliro>	because you persist
Mar 05 19:20:32 <grym>	that is usually how it works, yes
Mar 05 19:20:40 <quiliro>	yeah
Mar 05 19:20:51 <JohnGalt>	quiliro: youtube obscures the fragment paths in javascript, youtubedl has a javascript engine to find the fragments
Mar 05 19:21:11 <JohnGalt>	its a arms race, and elisp likely wont get a native elisp javascript engine
Mar 05 19:21:23 <quiliro>	sure
Mar 05 19:21:29 <quiliro>	I do not care for that
Mar 05 19:21:35 <grym>	ah.  then you're up a creek
Mar 05 19:21:38 <quiliro>	I would like to learn to scrape it
Mar 05 19:21:41 <JohnGalt>	dont use youtbe
Mar 05 19:21:43 <quiliro>	yes...
Mar 05 19:21:55 <JohnGalt>	quiliro: write a javascript engine
Mar 05 19:21:56 <grym>	quiliro: soooo you want to build a web engine in elisp, too
Mar 05 19:22:04 <quiliro>	I do not want to use javascript
Mar 05 19:22:12 <JohnGalt>	dont use youtube then
Mar 05 19:22:14 <grym>	then you're up a creek, but i repeat myself.
Mar 05 19:22:22 <quiliro>	I know
Mar 05 19:22:22 <JohnGalt>	they chose javascript not you
Mar 05 19:22:25 <sham1>	We already have like half a web engine in elisp
Mar 05 19:22:39 <sham1>	Well, somewhat. eww is odd
Mar 05 19:22:48 <quiliro>	what do you mean, sham1
Mar 05 19:22:49 <grym>	quiliro: ok, then... what are we talking ab out
Mar 05 19:23:46 <quiliro>	If I do not want javascript and cannot use youtube without javascript...I have to leave youtube
Mar 05 19:23:50 <grym>	yes
Mar 05 19:23:54 <grym>	them's the breaks
Mar 05 19:24:08 <sham1>	Doesn't inviduous allow you to download stuff without JS?
Mar 05 19:24:16 <sham1>	Because it basically just proxies the content
Mar 05 19:24:22 <grym>	it runs plenty of its own
Mar 05 19:24:25 <grym>	but it is a nice thing
Mar 05 19:24:32 <wgreenhouse>	yeah, nvidious can work without js
Mar 05 19:24:35 <wgreenhouse>	*invidious
Mar 05 19:24:38 <quiliro>	so it insists on using javascript, sham1
Mar 05 19:25:00 <wgreenhouse>	sham1: correct; there is no non-JS youtube site any more
Mar 05 19:25:03 <quiliro>	it still makes you connect to google
Mar 05 19:25:05 <wgreenhouse>	er quiliro: ^
Mar 05 19:25:19 <wgreenhouse>	yes, youtube is a google service
Mar 05 19:25:25 <younder>	A browser today hardly works without JavaScript. Good luck with that
Mar 05 19:25:28 <quiliro>	exactly
Mar 05 19:25:31 <sham1>	quiliro: well no. The invidious node is the one that connects to google
Mar 05 19:25:49 <wgreenhouse>	quiliro: yt-dlp also does not avoid running js, or talking to google
Mar 05 19:25:53 <sham1>	And part of the point is that you yourself don't need to go over there
Mar 05 19:25:59 <wgreenhouse>	it just does so in its own process
Mar 05 19:26:34 <quiliro>	when I open a video with eww and yt-dpl it shows urls with googlevideo on it
Mar 05 19:26:41 <quiliro>	them*
Mar 05 19:26:45 <e1f>	iirc a yt video is split into 3s segments which are then spread across the entire google yt cloud
Mar 05 19:26:47 <younder>	There is a small group that still lurks on gopher..
Mar 05 19:27:14 <grym>	quiliro: yes, no shit
Mar 05 19:27:16 <fristed>	Some invidious instances can proxy video's through their servers, preventing any direct connections to google
Mar 05 19:27:19 <grym>	quiliro: what else would it do
Mar 05 19:27:28 <younder>	Even more 'aged' than irc
Mar 05 19:27:43 <sham1>	e1f: makes sense since that also allows for Google to use their own infra for what is essentially CDN stuff
Mar 05 19:27:47 <bremner>	if you really want freedom from google, don't use youtube
Mar 05 19:27:57 <quiliro>	I like gopher and gemini...but I have not hung out there
Mar 05 19:27:58 <grym>	in which case, of course, freedom is privation
Mar 05 19:28:06 <sham1>	It's not a totally nefarious thing
Mar 05 19:28:46 <sham1>	Gemini the protocol has... problems
Mar 05 19:28:59 <quiliro>	anyway...I think someone should proxy google somehow
Mar 05 19:29:05 <grym>	quiliro: so do it
Mar 05 19:29:12 <grym>	(this is going to be a repeating theme)
Mar 05 19:29:21 <quiliro>	without making the users connect to google
Mar 05 19:29:26 <sham1>	Searx does that for search, invidious does that for youtube, etc
Mar 05 19:29:38 <quiliro>	but I have seen invidious instances do not do that
Mar 05 19:29:58 <quiliro>	I still go to google when I use them
Mar 05 19:30:06 <younder>	I have more problem with M$ owning github and tightening it's links with code.
Mar 05 19:30:13 <sham1>	Is that representative of all invidious instances? Because if not...
Mar 05 19:30:26 <quiliro>	maybe there are different policies
Mar 05 19:30:28 <sham1>	> M$
Mar 05 19:30:31 <sham1>	Lazy gag is lazy
Mar 05 19:31:16 <younder>	old as the hills.. ;)
Mar 05 19:31:44 <JohnGalt>	try you.com
Mar 05 19:31:52 <JohnGalt>	good google alternative
Mar 05 19:32:15 <JohnGalt>	and if you dont like google leave google. its that simple
Mar 05 19:32:29 <JohnGalt>	dns blackhole their adsense too
Mar 05 19:32:36 <JohnGalt>	watch the whole internet break
Mar 05 19:32:45 <sham1>	Well it's not that simple
Mar 05 19:33:06 <sham1>	For example if your place of work uses Google Workspace stuff, that can get odd
Mar 05 19:33:12 <grym>	i host my own invidious
Mar 05 19:33:17 <fristed>	Video proxy is not enabled by default and some instances disable it due to bandwidth constraints. It needs to be enabled in invidious settings or add &local=true in url
Mar 05 19:33:22 <JohnGalt>	I pulled all my data off with takeout and basically ditched google
Mar 05 19:33:23 <sham1>	Personally? Absolutely, but it's not as simple as just saying "no"
Mar 05 19:36:35 <JohnGalt>	rehab is hard
Mar 05 19:36:40 <JohnGalt>	but people do it
Mar 05 19:37:45 <sham1>	But yeah. An Elisp native bittorrent client
Mar 05 19:37:57 <sham1>	An interesting idea. I have to see if I ever get around to it
Mar 05 19:38:17 <tromey>	I vaguely thought there was one already
Mar 05 19:38:42 <grym>	it sounds like pain to me, but ..
Mar 05 19:39:09 <sham1>	No pain, no gain
Mar 05 19:40:06 <tromey>	what would the advantage of this be, over just a subprocess
Mar 05 19:40:14 <sham1>	tromey: there was one, but it doesn't seem all that feature ready. The description pretty much says that it was by the author to practice elisp with
Mar 05 19:40:28 <sham1>	Well, not much of an advantage
Mar 05 19:40:36 <sham1>	Except that you wouldn't need to install, say, rtorrent
Mar 05 19:44:00 <sham1>	Also, being impractical has never stopped people from creating Emacs stuff. I mean, we have not one but two IRC clients, two+ email things (and those are just the built-in ones) and so on
Mar 05 19:44:37 <tromey>	indeed that's true
Mar 05 19:44:41 <wgreenhouse>	someone did write a bencode library for elisp
Mar 05 19:44:53 <tromey>	don't let me dissuade you
Mar 05 19:44:57 <wgreenhouse>	just not the networking part of being a bittorrent client
Mar 05 19:45:05 <tromey>	hacking elisp can be done just for the joy of it
Mar 05 19:45:30 <JohnGalt>	use emacs, find itches
Mar 05 19:45:33 <JohnGalt>	scratch itches
Mar 05 19:46:01 <JohnGalt>	years later.... emacs = multiple bankrupcies
Mar 05 19:46:05 <sham1>	tromey: yeah, but that is also a valid question
Mar 05 19:46:30 <wasamasa>	sham1: I've started working on one, funnily enough
Mar 05 19:46:34 <wasamasa>	sham1: lots of moving pieces
Mar 05 19:46:46 <sham1>	Oh nice
Mar 05 19:47:01 <wasamasa>	I realized my networking skills were too bad to continue, so I instead practiced protohackers
Mar 05 19:47:13 <wasamasa>	and it made me realize that doing it in elisp would very quickly devolve into a big mess of callbacks
Mar 05 19:48:03 <wasamasa>	https://depp.brause.cc/protohackers/
Mar 05 19:48:11 <wasamasa>	just compare the scheme with the elisp stuff
Mar 05 19:48:37 <wasamasa>	in scheme I can use green threads or fork or whatever
Mar 05 19:48:49 <wasamasa>	in elisp, good luck with that
Mar 05 19:48:52 <tromey>	you can use green threads in elisp.  or the iterator thingy
Mar 05 19:49:09 <sham1>	Manual CPS transform in elisp, probabl
Mar 05 19:49:11 <wasamasa>	the iterator thingy is the closest to green
Mar 05 19:49:20 <sham1>	Since that's pretty much what callbacks are
Mar 05 19:49:24 <wasamasa>	if you mean native threads, they're more dark brown
Mar 05 19:49:46 <tromey>	sham1: yeah, there's one in tree already
Mar 05 19:49:55 <tromey>	see generator.el
Mar 05 19:50:32 <wasamasa>	also, I realized that emacs cannot do really basic things, such as sending an empty UDP packet
Mar 05 19:50:42 <bpalmer>	there is also aio
Mar 05 19:50:56 <tromey>	like, aio.el?
Mar 05 19:50:58 <tromey>	haven't heard of it
Mar 05 19:51:05 <wasamasa>	quiliro: in all likelihood, chances are you'd understand the python version of a torrent client better than the elisp one
Mar 05 19:51:08 <bpalmer>	,aio
Mar 05 19:51:09 <fsbot>	bpalmer: Can you elaborate on that?
Mar 05 19:51:17 <bpalmer>	,emacs-aio
Mar 05 19:51:18 <fsbot>	LOU GRANT froze my ASSETS!!
Mar 05 19:51:19 <tromey>	aha, built on top of generators
Mar 05 19:51:22 <tromey>	makes sense
Mar 05 19:51:53 <bpalmer>	,aio is think python's asyncio but for elisp. See https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-aio
Mar 05 19:51:54 <fsbot>	Created new note for "aio"
Mar 05 19:53:08 <sham1>	wasamasa: wait, you can't send an empty UDP? Not even with like a process-send-string with an empty string
Mar 05 19:53:13 <wasamasa>	quiliro: another more likely way of understanding a torrent client is to read the bittorrent specification, it's written in an informal style
Mar 05 19:53:35 <wasamasa>	sham1: correct
Mar 05 19:53:42 <wasamasa>	sham1: I made a bug report for it
Mar 05 19:54:25 <wasamasa>	https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=62990
Mar 05 19:54:27 <sham1>	That's... pretty odd
Mar 05 19:54:51 <wasamasa>	it's not so odd considering that an empty TCP packet is illegal
Mar 05 19:55:04 <wasamasa>	so the leaky abstraction for both TCP/UDP considers both cases the same
Mar 05 19:56:04 <wasamasa>	my favorite bit of this is how developers of GNU software (emacs) cannot be arsed to run another piece of GNU software (guile) to reproduce the bug
Mar 05 19:57:06 <davemq>	I don't know about an empty TCP packet. If you try to write 0 bytes to a TCP stream, it should have little to no effect. Maybe an implementation might try to send a TCP PSH with no data, I'd have to think about that
Mar 05 19:57:34 <wasamasa>	to quote someone else in the thread
Mar 05 19:57:35 <wasamasa>	> Empty TCP messages are perfectly valid, but they should be hidden from you. recvfrom returning 0 means the connection has been closed, but thatʼs a separate thing.
Mar 05 19:57:44 <wasamasa>	this is what I meant
Mar 05 19:58:15 <wasamasa>	oh, hm
Mar 05 19:58:25 <wasamasa>	I completely overlooked somehow there was a follow-up patch
Mar 05 19:58:36 <wasamasa>	perhaps I should revive this bug report if the combination resolves things
Mar 05 20:01:13 <davemq>	To be a little pedantic, TCP doesn't deal in messages, it deals in a stream of octets. You can get a 0 length read for EOF OR for a non-blocking read, though IIRC a non-blocking read typically returns -1 and sets an errno like EWOULDBLOCK
Mar 05 20:02:48 <wasamasa>	sham1: in any case, my point is that a torrent client is quite the expedition into uncharted waters and I stopped working on it since I ran out of time :(
Mar 05 20:04:14 <sham1>	Yeah... but it'd be an interesting exploration into implementing more weird binary protocols in elisp
Mar 05 20:04:55 <wasamasa>	it's not that weird
Mar 05 20:05:13 <wasamasa>	just the whole trying to transfer files efficiently thing is a bad match for a text editor
Mar 05 20:05:39 <wasamasa>	since most networking projects I've encountered are about 1 client connected to 1 server
Mar 05 20:05:51 <wasamasa>	or at best, a peer connected to another peer
Mar 05 20:06:07 <wasamasa>	but none of this connecting to a swarm of peers and deciding which ones to share with
Mar 05 20:07:18 <sham1>	But yeah, I feel that you should revive the bug report so we could have zero-length datagram receiving
Mar 05 20:08:04 <kickingvegas>	on emacs as a bittorrent client; seems like you'd want to have a separate daemon that does all the heavy lifting and have the elisp client just relay status from that daemon
Mar 05 20:08:12 <twb>	Sounds insufficiently byzantine to me

Mar 05 22:33:43 <sham1>	This is how I've just began to think about joins after I realised that the predicate can literally be any boolean function instead of requiring one-to-one
Mar 05 22:33:55 <Odin-LAP>	But unintentional self joins in a larger join tend to expand your result set considerably. :)
Mar 05 22:35:11 <corwin>	That I'll have to agree with.
Mar 05 22:35:21 <sham1>	Let A and B be the tables we're joining. Let P be the predicate. For each a in A and b in B, there exists c in A * B iff P(a, b) is true. Well something like that.
Mar 05 22:36:04 <sham1>	Basically one row can of course be joined to multiple rows, and not just in the sense where you could have like a relation table between the two tables, but for example you could join on B.value < 5
Mar 05 22:38:02 <Odin-LAP>	sham1: Combinatorial explosions are such fun, aren't they?
Mar 05 22:38:06 <sham1>	Yeah
Mar 05 22:40:28 <sham1>	One thing that always baffled me is the popularity of NoSQL databases esp. in the 2010s even though SQL is so powerful and useful for munging data
Mar 05 22:40:47 <grym>	predefining a relational schema can suck
Mar 05 22:40:56 <grym>	,next
Mar 05 22:40:56 <fsbot>	Another satisfied customer. NEXT!
Mar 05 22:41:54 <sham1>	That's fair, but even for most NoSQL databases you end up having some kind of an ad-hoc data relation thing, because usually data does have to relate to other data in some ways
Mar 05 22:42:31 <Odin-LAP>	I think there's a second factor that's at least as significant, and that's the fact that a _lot_ of programmers really, really don't like declarative coding.
Mar 05 22:43:01 <sham1>	Mmm.
Mar 05 22:43:03 <Odin-LAP>	That's also why CSS continuously gets the short stick from web developers.
Mar 05 22:43:51 <sham1>	Of course, there are NoSQL databases that are useful. Redis for example, but I don't know how you might even use that as a primary data source (cf. the boom that MongoDB had) instead of as the caching DB that it always was
Mar 05 22:44:08 <sham1>	Caching and inter-service message stuff
Mar 05 22:47:13 <sham1>	Erlang platform of course has the mnesia thing, which IIRC scales rather nicely (it's Erlang after all) but even then I feel like it would be most useful for prototyping since, again, you most likely want to have some kind of a relation model
Mar 05 22:47:30 <bpalmer>	in a lot of high-qps situations, you *don't* want a relational model.
Mar 05 22:47:38 <bpalmer>	You want vastly denormalized tables you can patch up after the fact.
Mar 05 22:48:24 <sham1>	But you'd still be normalising them after the fact
Mar 05 22:48:41 <sham1>	Or what do you mean by patching up
Mar 05 22:55:50 <bpalmer>	I'm a little rusty so my examples aren't great, but imagine you're tracking purchases of people and displaying for each user how much they've spent in total. A classic denormalized model might be something like Account(id, name, ...)  and Purchase(id, account_id, foreign key (account_id) references account(id), itemname, cost)
Mar 05 22:56:36 <quiliro>	I thought you were talking about joins in elisp
Mar 05 22:56:52 <bpalmer>	so the classic relational way would be to do a join and sum across those tables. And when an account is deleted, you're going to be locking the purchase table and deleting all rows that reference the account.
Mar 05 22:57:18 <JohnGalt>	Holy Crap, I HATE vi, if I wanted to edit on a dot-matrix printer I would go back in time ala Back to the Future
Mar 05 22:57:40 <sham1>	I mean, at least it's not ed. And I say this as someone who actually does like ed
Mar 05 22:57:58 <bpalmer>	but you could also just write into Purchase without ever joining back into Account table, and also keep a RunningSum(account id, total)  table that you just add to at the same time that you insert into purchase
Mar 05 22:58:51 <bpalmer>	then sometime after your business closes, you go through a list of all the deleted accounts, and remove them from the purchase table. Similarly, you deal with all returned purchases in bulk and subtract them from the RunningSum table
Mar 05 22:59:32 <JohnGalt>	Vi is like having your head smashed with a brick with a lemon wrapped around it
Mar 05 22:59:33 <bpalmer>	you're doing this "patching up" in the background -- you're willing to settle for eventually consistent data instead of atomically consistent.
Mar 05 23:00:04 <sham1>	Hm, I can see the use
Mar 05 23:01:36 <rpav>	i thought vi was more like playing rogue with your text
Mar 05 23:01:53 <bpalmer>	What's the backstab multiplier?
Mar 05 23:02:22 <dcb>	maybe querying graphs with sql would also be problematic
Mar 05 23:03:08 <rpav>	5istab => stabstabstabstabstab
Mar 05 23:03:35 <bpalmer>	GraphQL confused me for a while as I thought it was addressing a different problem than it does
Mar 05 23:04:02 <rpav>	i'm still not entirely sure what problem it solves
Mar 05 23:04:09 <technomancy>	rpav: frontend developer job security
Mar 05 23:04:19 <rpav>	technomancy: ah well that explains it (;
Mar 05 23:04:49 <sham1>	It also addresses the question of "how do we make this API slow and allocate a lot of garbage promises"
Mar 05 23:05:14 <sham1>	Because instead of a paperclip maximizer, web development is RAM usage maximizer
Mar 05 23:05:19 <bpalmer>	spoiler: don't await a Promise<garbage>
Mar 05 23:05:20 <technomancy>	"I feel like my life doesn't have enough 32-bit integer overflows in it these days"
Mar 05 23:05:21 <Odin-DECK>	Dunno, half these technologies seem geared towards ensuring front-end developer turnaround.
Mar 05 23:05:46 <technomancy>	(yes this is a real thing; I had to patch around it just last week. graphql integers max out at 32-bits for some godforsaken reason)
Mar 05 23:06:04 <sham1>	For fun adventures
Mar 05 23:06:13 <Odin-DECK>	bpalmer: node is horrible with promises that resolve to 'undefined'.
Mar 05 23:06:20 <sham1>	It's probably because until relatively recently, in Javascript you could only use (signed) integers up to 32-bits
Mar 05 23:06:30 <technomancy>	Odin-DECK: that's a little on-the-nose even for node
Mar 05 23:07:07 <JohnGalt>	I am totally done with *BSD
Mar 05 23:07:10 <Odin-DECK>	technomancy: I think something like half the filesystem API works that way.
Mar 05 23:07:10 <sham1>	Like, JavaScript's Number is of course IEEE 754 double-precision floating point number, but if you do a bitwise operation, it gets treated like a 32-bit signed integer
Mar 05 23:07:15 <JohnGalt>	its so rediculous
Mar 05 23:07:27 <sham1>	So that's why I think GraphQL has only 32-bit integers
Mar 05 23:08:08 <sham1>	Gotta optimize for those frontend technology deficiencies, guise
Mar 05 23:08:28 <Odin-DECK>	sham1: That's actually not supposed to be visible to user code, but it's part of the ASM.js optimisations.
Mar 05 23:08:42 <JohnGalt>	installing BSD is like snorting powedered glass
Mar 05 23:08:57 <Odin-DECK>	(The "turns into a 32-bit integer" thing, that is.)
Mar 05 23:09:02 <corwin>	"We're not saying it's a bad idea, it's just an optimization best made on the chip"
Mar 05 23:09:09 *	Odin-DECK never once succeeded in installing FreeBSD.
Mar 05 23:09:29 <Odin-DECK>	BeOS, Solaris, QNX, Haiku ... all fine.
Mar 05 23:10:20 <JohnGalt>	tried openbsd = unusable, freebsd = unbootable , dragondfly = nothing works
Mar 05 23:10:58 <sham1>	ECMAScript explicitly states that doing a bitwise operator, "Return the Number value for the integer represented by the 32-bit two's complement bit string result."
Mar 05 23:11:15 <sham1>	So it's very much meant to be user-visible
Mar 05 23:11:40 <JohnGalt>	typescript is like Ada with objects
Mar 05 23:11:48 <JohnGalt>	definitely plastic scissors
Mar 05 23:12:39 <sham1>	What isn't visible is that the JS engine might change its internal representation to actually be a 32-bit signed integer instead of a IEEE 754 double-precision floating point number, but the Number very specifically gets the value of the bitwise operator
Mar 05 23:12:44 <sham1>	https://262.ecma-international.org/14.0/#sec-numberbitwiseop
Mar 05 23:13:12 <corwin>	let's make JR a strongly typed flavor of EMCAscript that compiles down to rust
Mar 05 23:13:13 <Odin-DECK>	sham1: Oh, right. Yeah, the bitwise operators are strange in an all-float environment.
Mar 05 23:13:15 <sham1>	So yeah, `x|0` was used as an optimisation hint by asm.js, but there's a spec reason for that. It wasn't just a random thing
Mar 05 23:13:32 <bpalmer>	corwin: javascript, jr. ?
Mar 05 23:13:48 <corwin>	bpalmer: you know, for kids.
Mar 05 23:13:48 <sham1>	JavaRust?
Mar 05 23:14:24 <Odin-DECK>	corwin: https://www.assemblyscript.org/ <-- This close enough for you?
Mar 05 23:14:30 <corwin>	I was trying to rhyme with "TS".  I got nothing.
Mar 05 23:14:55 <JohnGalt>	Lets make everything staticly typed!! then we can all stop reading code and abuse type checkers
Mar 05 23:14:59 <Odin-DECK>	Although the folks running that project are very much not fans of Rust and want to use WTF-16 for everything because "that's what JavaScript does".
Mar 05 23:15:03 <bpalmer>	rudybot: then I told the kids, they can go to their room without any supper, or they can make me an ecommerce PWA. They get the punishment they choose.
Mar 05 23:15:05 <rudybot>	bpalmer: h OK. Try this: https://plus.google.com/photos/115209488640908180409/albums/posts/5862911967574803954?banner=pwa&pid=5862911967574803954&oid=115209488640908180409
Mar 05 23:15:07 <corwin>	I have never looked into webassy; I should learn something about that one day.
Mar 05 23:15:35 <Odin-DECK>	corwin: It's really cool and completely insane at the same time.
Mar 05 23:18:15 <JohnGalt>	omg anyone who uses google anything either hasnt seen the google graveyard or are in denial
Mar 05 23:18:23 <JohnGalt>	anyone got any stadia controllers? LOL
Mar 05 23:18:32 <JohnGalt>	Circles?
Mar 05 23:18:52 *	Odin-DECK strongly suspects that's not a recent link.
Mar 05 23:19:33 <sham1>	WebAssembly is neat in many ways.
Mar 05 23:20:01 <Odin-DECK>	It's really a shame that it's tied to the web. :)
Mar 05 23:20:30 <sham1>	I've been thinking about compiling ECL for WASM for work stuff so I could run CL stuff like Maxima on the browser. It would probably require a bunch of extra stuff, but it might just be worth it
Mar 05 23:24:05 <rpav>	i think wasm is neater for what it might eventually do out of the browser, but otoh it's err not the best and not necessarily necessary anyway
Mar 05 23:24:42 <sham1>	WASI is an interesting model of OS interaction
Mar 05 23:26:27 <Odin-DECK>	wasm has a potentially interesting role in making it easier to run untrusted code, IMO.
Mar 05 23:27:01 <Odin-DECK>	But it's really heavily oriented towards fairly static, AOT-compiled languages, which is annoying.
Mar 05 23:27:27 <hodapp>	enh, we've already enough things for more dynamic languages

Mar 06 01:55:10 <e1f>	we run freebsd on our servers, and it has been quite stable for decades. the last upgrade however, was ugly; there were changes to an intermediate stage of the os upgrade procedure that broke a few things esp. around pam and ssl
Mar 06 01:55:36 <e1f>	were you referring to that?
Mar 06 01:56:43 <mattie>	freebsd spontaneously rebooted when i breathed on it

Mar 06 02:00:28 <bremner>	for some reason I am mildly surprised that FreeBSD uses PAM. I thought PAM was a linuxism.

Mar 06 02:10:08 <technomancy>	1466
Mar 06 02:10:31 <technomancy>	but that includes a line for every gif in my gifs directory
Mar 06 02:10:43 <wgreenhouse>	only 238 lines right now. and no gif menu. lmao
Mar 06 02:10:55 <technomancy>	so the real code is 506 lines less
Mar 06 02:11:25 <grym>	pretty long
Mar 06 02:11:46 <grym>	~3k lines
Mar 06 02:12:41 <weary-traveler>	1658 SLOC per sloccount
Mar 06 02:13:02 <weary-traveler>	a considerable portion of that is probably email configuration
Mar 06 02:13:55 <grym>	ok, 2k sloc
Mar 06 02:14:08 <wgreenhouse>	email.
Mar 06 02:14:28 <wgreenhouse>	weary-traveler: amazingly, my gnus config at present is almost all M-x customize
Mar 06 02:14:29 <JordiGH>	Hey, are any of you at Facebook or Meta?
Mar 06 02:14:31 <JordiGH>	I have questions.
Mar 06 02:14:32 <wgreenhouse>	there really was not much to do
Mar 06 02:14:33 <grym>	the email, the email; what, what, the email
Mar 06 02:14:45 <JordiGH>	grym: sbemail!
Mar 06 02:14:53 <grym>	there, that ought to agestamp me
Mar 06 02:15:01 <grym>	JordiGH: da cheat is _grounded_
Mar 06 02:15:09 *	wgreenhouse refrains from asking how JordiGH and grym type with boxing gloves on
Mar 06 02:15:35 <grym>	with flash!
Mar 06 02:15:45 <JordiGH>	grym: LIGHT SWITCH RAVE
Mar 06 02:15:55 <weary-traveler>	wgreenhouse: i started there, but with multiple accounts there're too many redundancies. especially if you're using something like gnus-alias in addition to posting styles
Mar 06 02:16:06 <weary-traveler>	s/redundancies/duplications/
Mar 06 02:16:21 <wgreenhouse>	weary-traveler: I stuck with posting styles and the X-Message-SMTP-Method facility in message-mode
Mar 06 02:16:39 <wgreenhouse>	I was aggressively trying not to have gnus-related hax I had to think about, tho
Mar 06 02:16:49 <wgreenhouse>	and pretty much succeeded
Mar 06 02:16:57 <JordiGH>	It's funny, I seem to know a bunch of people working at Google, but I don't know any at Facebook.
Mar 06 02:17:08 <wgreenhouse>	JordiGH: we used to have a mole there
Mar 06 02:17:32 <weary-traveler>	heh i use gnus-alias to set the X-Message-SMTP-Method. gnus-alias was almost entirely because i couldn't figure out how to get debbugs.el to get the right settings
Mar 06 02:17:38 <JordiGH>	I think I got pissy with the Facebook people I used to know after they forked off Mercurial.
Mar 06 02:17:41 <grym>	wgreenhouse: yeh and he's the only one i can think of...
Mar 06 02:17:55 <wgreenhouse>	weary-traveler: ah yeah I've heard of debbugs completely hosing your preexisting posting styles
Mar 06 02:18:03 <technomancy>	Mercurial; that's the thing that crossed the line?
Mar 06 02:18:06 <wgreenhouse>	is it this sort of thing
Mar 06 02:18:39 <technomancy>	not Cambridge Analytica, or the Rohingya situation
Mar 06 02:19:12 <grym>	technomancy: allowing non-@edus.  after that, it was just all downhill
Mar 06 02:19:31 <weary-traveler>	wgreenhouse: whatever you've heard. it's that and worse. i've come to appreciate just how much "magic" there is in sending email via emacs. to a large extent gnus deals with it for you and all is fine and dandy till debbugs comes bumbling along
Mar 06 02:19:40 <grym>	if you can't upload a spreadsheet of your classes to find out who the hot people are you're taking classes with, just ... delete it
Mar 06 02:19:43 <grym>	what's the point
Mar 06 02:19:45 <technomancy>	grym: well, even when it was .edus it was still initially designed as stalkerware
Mar 06 02:19:51 <e1f>	til openpam was developed for freebsd under a darpa contract
Mar 06 02:19:57 <technomancy>	jinx
Mar 06 02:19:59 <grym>	:D
Mar 06 02:20:03 <wgreenhouse>	weary-traveler: which is interesting, because debbugs is made of gnus' libraries, and is [ab]using its structures. maybe that's the problem?
Mar 06 02:20:21 <wgreenhouse>	it does things as globals that interfere with the global state gnus expects to solely run??
Mar 06 02:20:22 <fsbot>	Ask yourself, do you really want to know?
Mar 06 02:20:38 <wgreenhouse>	if so, that calls for some kind of profile facility in gnus
Mar 06 02:20:49 <wgreenhouse>	so you can safely use gnus proper and debbugs.el in the same emacs
Mar 06 02:20:53 <weary-traveler>	wgreenhouse: it's just aware enough [of gnus] to cause trouble
Mar 06 02:21:16 <wgreenhouse>	weary-traveler: interesting. is one order more dangerous than the other?
Mar 06 02:21:29 <wgreenhouse>	are you more likely to fall down go boom with gnus already up?
Mar 06 02:21:41 <weary-traveler>	i gave up on trying to fix it and went the way of gnus-alias. which clumsy as it is, at least works with the help of x-message-smtp-method
Mar 06 02:23:01 <JordiGH>	technomancy: fb messed with my Mercurial, you bet that's where they crossed the line.
Mar 06 02:23:02 <weary-traveler>	wgreenhouse: you mean if within the same emacs session you have both gnus and debbugs running does that cause additional headache?
Mar 06 02:23:09 <JordiGH>	This aggression will not stand, man.
Mar 06 02:23:10 <JordiGH>	,dude
Mar 06 02:23:11 <fsbot>	"Do you speak Emacs sir? Parla usted Elisp?"
Mar 06 02:23:25 <weary-traveler>	if that's the question, not to my knowledge. they mostly seem to set things in a buffer-local fashion
Mar 06 02:23:48 <grym>	let's add a sounding mode to mercurial to prevent stds
Mar 06 02:23:49 <corwin>	e1f: we saw the same on svh servers
Mar 06 02:24:28 <corwin>	so whatever going on with pam/openssl is breaking trisquel also, I guess?  (No BSD there.)
Mar 06 02:25:18 <wgreenhouse>	weary-traveler: I'll have to play with this (carefully).
Mar 06 02:28:04 <weary-traveler>	wgreenhouse: if you do come up with a way to get debbugs to safely not override posting styles and obviate the need for gnus-alias, i'd be curious. as far as broken things are concerned the issue with debbugs is fairly contained - it simply tried very hard and succeeded in being oblivious of posting styles
Mar 06 02:28:05 <e1f>	oh, interesting. i wonder what the underlying cause is. we didn't investigate any further after getting things to work again
Mar 06 02:28:27 <weary-traveler>	*user-defined posting styles (iirc it sets it to some of its own)
Mar 06 02:28:45 <e1f>	it was odd that there was no mention of it in the release notes
Mar 06 02:28:55 <weary-traveler>	the other thing debbugs.el does is it assumes if you're using it, surely you only want to be working on Emacs
Mar 06 02:29:43 <wgreenhouse>	lol
Mar 06 02:38:11 <weary-traveler>	so applying patches isn't that smooth. i have a clunky process atm with saving the articles via gnus and then applying via magit. i've heard good things about b4 and piem but not tried any of those
Mar 06 02:46:49 <mattie>	wow, the only portable way to roll is to build from source
Mar 06 02:49:55 <spikemaster>	well i mean all Emacs are built from source. It's just whether it's by you or some other guy.
Mar 06 02:50:28 <mattie>	well every system seems to have different versions and features
Mar 06 02:50:35 <mattie>	it's obnoxious to the extreme
Mar 06 02:51:19 <mattie>	Im just burnt from trying to get open sores to work at all
Mar 06 02:51:37 <weary-traveler>	switch to guix or nixos?
Mar 06 02:51:44 <mattie>	possible
Mar 06 02:51:53 <mattie>	Ill take a look at them
Mar 06 02:52:01 <weary-traveler>	though i've had no issues simply using those as package managers on  opensuse
Mar 06 02:53:12 <mattie>	linux mint had 27
Mar 06 02:53:24 <mattie>	and unless you checked it gave you a flatpack
Mar 06 02:59:35 <hwpplayer1>	hi Emacs People !
Mar 06 03:00:08 <dcb>	I'm guessing compiling emacs from source should be simpler than setting up guix
Mar 06 03:00:56 <hwpplayer1>	building or compiling ? which one do you prefer to say ?
Mar 06 03:03:46 <mattie>	mm compiling
Mar 06 03:03:57 <mattie>	im kinda old like that
Mar 06 03:04:03 <mattie>	building is probably more accurate
Mar 06 03:06:15 <dcb>	"prefabricate"
Mar 06 03:09:14 <mattie>	well if Im going to beta test something I would rather it be emacs
Mar 06 03:20:01 <weary-traveler>	dcb: depends on if there are possibly other packages that need to be compiled that may require different versions of the build toolchain. if that's the case, setting up guix is simpler
Mar 06 03:29:56 <mattie>	wow, 30 is actually working
Mar 06 03:33:13 <mattie>	open source is war on your productivity
Mar 06 03:35:51 <grym>	`paru emacs-git`, wait about ... 3 minutes?
Mar 06 03:35:53 <grym>	hard life
Mar 06 03:37:12 <mattie>	what is paru?
Mar 06 03:37:25 <grym>	an arch package manager front-end
Mar 06 03:37:39 <mattie>	I used arch, it broke alot
Mar 06 03:37:53 <mattie>	had good docs though
Mar 06 03:37:55 <mattie>	pacman sux
Mar 06 03:38:06 <dcb>	even the steps from the installation readme doesn't seem particularly complex
Mar 06 03:38:35 <mattie>	a near infinite loop of installing -dev packages
Mar 06 03:38:58 <grym>	mmm that sounds like ubuntu
Mar 06 03:39:11 <mattie>	I think mint is ubuntu based
Mar 06 03:39:31 <grym>	i forget
Mar 06 03:39:33 <mattie>	two of my servers are ubuntu as well
Mar 06 03:40:20 <mattie>	by manually downloading and installing firmware I did get wifi, and wifi6 as well
Mar 06 03:40:30 <mattie>	but wifi6 has a weaker signal
Mar 06 03:41:15 <dcb>	maybe I was lucky but I experienced less breaking with arch, compared to two ubuntu distros I ran
Mar 06 03:41:51 <mattie>	Everything has broken for me
Mar 06 03:42:04 <grym>	i run arch at work
Mar 06 03:42:07 <grym>	no regrets so far
Mar 06 03:42:17 <mattie>	MacOS severed find my for my airpods, and trashed my keyring twice on the i9 machine
Mar 06 03:42:20 <dcb>	once I had issues starting X after an update to the graphics driver... and that was it
Mar 06 03:42:47 <mattie>	every bsd had every breakage imaginable, and doesnt support thunderbird
Mar 06 03:42:52 <mattie>	thunderbolt
Mar 06 03:43:01 <dcb>	I did have issues upgrading between major ubuntu versions, however
Mar 06 03:43:16 <mattie>	linux screwed me from 2.x on
Mar 06 03:43:36 <grym>	dcb: coworker hit the weirdest do-release-upgrade bug i've seen last week
Mar 06 03:44:06 <e1f>	mattie: have you considered that you may be cursed?
Mar 06 03:44:08 <grym>	he wound up with two kernels, and one of them believed that the uuids in fstab were wrong
Mar 06 03:44:23 <craigbro>	should go into QA, would be stellar
Mar 06 03:44:24 <grym>	a little apt-purge later...
Mar 06 03:44:42 <dcb>	the release upgrades are fairly time consuming sometimes
Mar 06 03:44:55 <mattie>	e1f: if you only knew.....
Mar 06 03:45:29 <dcb>	so much that I got into the habit of simply overwriting the install, home partition included since most things would break
Mar 06 03:46:07 <dcb>	I kinda forgot the feeling of declaring distro bankruptcy after arch
Mar 06 03:53:01 <weary-traveler>	suse tumbleweed does rolling distro right. their openqa means breakages are rare. and snapper and btrfs and their grub2 patches ensure that when they do occur rolling back is easy
Mar 06 03:54:43 <e1f>	i'll contact the vatican and see if they're interested enough in your case for an exorcism
Mar 06 03:55:51 <craigbro>	anyone got an erc face mapping for modux themes?
Mar 06 03:56:02 <craigbro>	modus even....
Mar 06 04:18:20 <Viking667>	hi all
Mar 06 04:19:32 <mattie>	yo
Mar 06 04:20:08 <mattie>	Laptop works, except for yubikey, Macallan 15 yr, Single Malt double cask
Mar 06 04:20:44 <Viking667>	sounds like a nice way to celebrate. Why does a laptop rate that?
Mar 06 04:20:54 <mattie>	Unsurprisingly Emacs 30 is very good indeed
Mar 06 04:21:10 <Viking667>	I haven't taken the plunge.
Mar 06 04:21:23 <mattie>	Because I have installed openbsd, freebsd, dragonfly bsd, and now Linux mint with endless headaches
Mar 06 04:21:53 <Viking667>	so OpenXNI... er,8ONuth
Mar 06 04:21:56 <Viking667>	 Cat.....
Mar 06 04:22:16 <mattie>	Yubikey I will battle later
Mar 06 04:22:17 <Viking667>	So. OpenBSD gave you grief, FreeBSD gave you grief, etc?
Mar 06 04:22:23 <mattie>	oh yeah
Mar 06 04:22:34 <Viking667>	huh? What about the toaster BSD?
Mar 06 04:22:43 <spikemaster>	craigbro: something like this can be used to tweak the erc faces. http://paste.debian.net/1309616/
Mar 06 04:23:33 <craigbro>	spikemaster: thanks
Mar 06 04:23:48 <mattie>	In a world of terrible Operating Systems Emacs is the only constant
Mar 06 04:24:14 <Viking667>	I think I used some form of green, as it was a passable colour that worked in both light and dark themes. I'll pull up the exact colour in a moment.
Mar 06 04:25:12 <Viking667>	Yeah. Here we are:     (erc-input-face ((t (:foreground "forest green"))))
Mar 06 04:26:06 <wgreenhouse>	a good trick is to borrow something that will usually inherit from a prominent face in whatever theme, e.g. :inherit font-lock-constant-face
Mar 06 04:26:51 <Viking667>	Granted, and I sometimes wish I had thought of that. However, I think I came up with a workable result.
Mar 06 04:28:00 <Viking667>	And the beauty of my solution is that it doesn't matter what theme I'm using, my "forest green" stays the same throughout.
Mar 06 04:28:09 <Viking667>	Anyhow, I gotta shaddup
Mar 06 04:37:22 <mattie>	my pain: bsd = apm, macos = pmset, linux = acpi - to get battery charge
Mar 06 04:39:34 <Viking667>	And then there's Windows.
Mar 06 04:39:50 <Viking667>	No doubt that's some weird libcall from powershell
Mar 06 04:39:51 <mattie>	we do not invoke the dark one here
Mar 06 04:40:16 <Viking667>	Big deal. It's just .mmmgffmffmmmffmmm....
Mar 06 04:40:45 <mattie>	write out windows, erase half the letters, re-incantate
Mar 06 04:40:51 <mattie>	from set satanism
Mar 06 04:41:11 <Viking667>	inos
Mar 06 04:44:35 <craigbro>	oh..... heh, I had disabled global font lock mode...
Mar 06 04:51:05 <craigbro>	after almost 30 years I still manage to derp in my emacs
Mar 06 04:51:20 <Viking667>	that's a derp?
Mar 06 04:53:02 <craigbro>	I was confused as to why the set-face-attribute calls where not making any colors in my ERC buffers..  took me 10 minutes to realize it was because no font-lock in erc-mode
Mar 06 04:53:09 <craigbro>	so yah, calling that a derp
Mar 06 04:53:55 <Viking667>	Where were you using that set-face-attribute call? from within an ERC window's minibuffer?
Mar 06 04:54:53 <craigbro>	nah, more complex...  in the indirect edit of a org-babel code block..
Mar 06 04:55:31 <Viking667>	Ah. Won't do much there. Did you try inside M-:  (I think that's where it'd go?)
Mar 06 04:57:34 <Viking667>	... prod... prod... hmm, meat's still soft, marthter.
Mar 06 05:17:23 <craigbro>	Viking667: well, custom-set-face worked from any context, so just converted to that form
Mar 06 05:18:02 <craigbro>	but then decided I was ok with the default colors that the theme provided already... so deleted it all
Mar 06 07:10:06 <codingquark>	Good morning!

Mar 06 07:48:48 <RickAstley>	How do I tell emacs minibuffer it should always use a certain path?
Mar 06 07:49:09 <bpalmer>	RickAstley: what do you mean?
Mar 06 07:49:14 <RickAstley>	For instance I always want it to go to home when I find file. Not the current directory
Mar 06 07:49:39 <RickAstley>	bpalmer: using helm-find-file I always want it to start at ~/ not current dir
Mar 06 07:49:48 <RickAstley>	Although I want this behavior to change depending on the major mode
Mar 06 07:50:25 <wgreenhouse>	RickAstley: see ,,dv read-file-name-function
Mar 06 07:50:25 <fsbot>	The function called by ‘read-file-name’ to do its work.
Mar 06 07:50:25 <fsbot>	It should accept the same arguments as ‘read-file-name’.
Mar 06 07:50:25 <fsbot>	Defined in `/usr/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/minibuffer.elc'.
Mar 06 07:50:27 <bpalmer>	RickAstley: by default, find file (and thus probably helm-find-file) will use the path in default-directory to start from
Mar 06 07:50:51 <bpalmer>	RickAstley: you can simply set this value (such as with M-x cd RET ), either interactively, or in your mode hook
Mar 06 07:51:33 <wgreenhouse>	or, yeah, manipulate default-directory (which is buffer local) from a mode hook--better than defining a new read-file-name-function. :)
Mar 06 07:52:17 <RickAstley>	wgreenhouse bpalmer: ty
Mar 06 07:52:43 <RickAstley>	any way to bookmark / mark this IRC fragment with circe and org-remark
Mar 06 07:57:04 <RickAstley>	Wondering if there's a way to save circe-channel-mode in like a text file as an irc log then highlight stuff
Mar 06 07:58:01 <RickAstley>	I see there's erclogging...
Mar 06 07:58:46 <RickAstley>	wasamasa: where do I read about how to log with circe
Mar 06 07:59:04 <bpalmer>	you can just copy and paste things into a text file.
Mar 06 07:59:21 <bpalmer>	otherwise, I believe circe has a logging module, but you'll have to check its documentation
Mar 06 07:59:44 <RickAstley>	how do I pull up manual on emacs package I always forget this
Mar 06 07:59:57 <RickAstley>	M-x info no circe entry :/
Mar 06 08:00:14 <bpalmer>	fsbot: circe
Mar 06 08:00:15 <fsbot>	Circe is [0] a Client for IRC in Emacs at https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/circe/wiki
Mar 06 08:00:15 <fsbot>	[1] Visit us in #emacs-circe
Mar 06 08:00:26 <bpalmer>	check its wiki on github
Mar 06 08:02:28 <RickAstley>	found it thank
Mar 06 08:02:34 <RickAstley>	If I want to make the wiki into info package howto
Mar 06 08:06:40 <RickAstley>	circe doesn't log until buffer killed and if you kill buffer it leaves the channel :/
Mar 06 08:07:37 <bpalmer>	that doesn't seem like it's useful behavior, so I wonder if you might be misinterpreting something
Mar 06 08:12:05 <RickAstley>	odd, circe logs even when the buffer isn't killed
Mar 06 08:12:10 <RickAstley>	idk why the docs say that
Mar 06 08:12:13 <RickAstley>	I'll update them
Mar 06 08:17:08 <RickAstley>	can someone replay for me the question I asked before I was asking about logging and what the answer was
Mar 06 08:17:26 <RickAstley>	idk if there's a bot here for that
Mar 06 08:19:20 <RickAstley>	I wonder if someone sent me weird unicode if the write file could pwn me :D
Mar 06 08:24:12 <bkhl>	Certainly stuff like this can happen with bugs in UTF-8 parsing: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2008-37/
Mar 06 08:44:17 <Viking667>	pffft. No luck searching for an oil painter called Minteer. I can see pictures, but no biographical data on them whatsoever aside from their having painted in the 1940s and '50s.
Mar 06 08:49:12 <Viking667>	 I'm also not having much luck with another artist simply titled H. Carter.
Mar 06 09:50:44 <philipp_>	When I use M-x compile, why does the command run in some other directory, but not in the directory of the current file or in default-directory?
Mar 06 09:51:13 <philipp_>	Nevermind, I was using recompile instead of compile.
Mar 06 10:03:32 <Viking667>	And here was I thinking that compile actually compiled emacs. It doesn't, but I guess it could be taught how - I went the bash script route, but there's no reason I couldn't have figured out how to do it from within Emacs itself - the only problem being replacing the running binary.
