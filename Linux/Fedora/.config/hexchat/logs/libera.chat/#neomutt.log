janv. 18 11:06:19 <flatcap>	morning all
janv. 18 11:20:43 <roccoblues>	good morning
janv. 18 11:21:41 <roccoblues>	flatcap: looking for some recreational refactoring tasks
janv. 18 11:22:06 <roccoblues>	do you think it makes sense to spend time on smth like removing mutt_str_dequote_comment()
janv. 18 11:22:18 <roccoblues>	it's only used in a buffer function, I'd inline the code there
janv. 18 11:26:07 <flatcap>	hi roccoblues 
janv. 18 11:26:18 *	flatcap looks ...
janv. 18 11:27:46 <flatcap>	yeah, sounds reasonable
janv. 18 11:28:30 <roccoblues>	ok, I'll also look through the mutt_str_* functions and see if we have other that are called mostly with buffers
janv. 18 11:28:39 <roccoblues>	maybe we can migrate some more
janv. 18 11:28:47 <flatcap>	cool
janv. 18 11:28:53 *	flatcap looks through trivial.txt (his short-term memory backup :-)...
janv. 18 12:56:03 <patroniv>	Hi, could someone please explain to me how "regex" works? I tried to set it up for my native language, however when I want to reply to a message, neomutt always puts "re" in the subject line anyway 
janv. 18 12:56:40 <patroniv>	i mean set reply_regexp. in my case is set to "^((Odp.)(\[[0-9]+\])*:[ \t]*)*"
janv. 18 13:04:00 <flatcap>	hi patroniv, I'll try :-)
janv. 18 13:04:35 <flatcap>	when you reply to an email, the subject gets a prefix of "Re:"
janv. 18 13:04:58 <flatcap>	that would lead to re: re: re: ... after several replies
janv. 18 13:05:30 <flatcap>	so reply_regex tries to match any of that repeated string and kill it, leaving just Re:

Feb 21 11:01:37 <gahr>	morning roccoblues 
Feb 21 11:03:36 <roccoblues>	hi gahr 
Feb 21 11:03:45 <roccoblues>	how is life?
Feb 21 11:17:46 <gahr>	busy :) how about you?
Feb 21 11:18:31 <roccoblues>	same :)
Feb 21 11:18:36 <roccoblues>	crazy workload right now
Feb 21 11:18:43 <roccoblues>	plus private life :D
Feb 21 11:19:27 <roccoblues>	somehow we managed to put cycle planning + performance review in the same calendar spot
Feb 21 11:19:47 <roccoblues>	so the last weeks were super busy
Feb 21 11:27:51 <gahr>	how long's a cycle?
Feb 21 11:28:46 <roccoblues>	4 month
Feb 21 11:31:21 <gahr>	interesting
Feb 21 11:31:30 <gahr>	we work in quarters
Feb 21 11:33:25 <roccoblues>	we used to, but then it was switched because ending the cycle at the end of the year was also suboptimal
Feb 21 11:33:30 <roccoblues>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Feb 21 11:33:54 <gahr>	that makes a lot of sense actually.. how about ending a cycle at the end of august, though?
Feb 21 11:33:57 <gahr>	:)
Feb 21 11:34:09 <gahr>	ah you probably do your vacations early in .de, right?
Feb 21 11:34:19 <gahr>	*earlier, like June?
Feb 21 11:34:25 <roccoblues>	depends on the county
Feb 21 11:34:33 <roccoblues>	*if* you have kids
Feb 21 11:59:53 <flatcap>	morning all

Feb 22 11:27:43 <socksinspace>	What am i doing wrong here? 'Bad regex: *@vger.kernel.org' i want to configure nemoutt to assume mail with those, and a few other domains, belongs to lists, like this "lists *@vger.kernel.org *@lists.linux.dev *@lists.infradead.org"
Feb 22 11:28:09 <qyliss>	*@vger.kernel.org is a glob pattern, not a regex
Feb 22 11:28:14 <qyliss>	perhaps you want .*@vger.kernel.org
Feb 22 11:28:33 <socksinspace>	I'll try
Feb 22 11:28:42 <socksinspace>	sounds plausible ;)
Feb 22 11:30:16 <socksinspace>	seems to have done the trick, thanks

Feb 29 13:48:28 <rustbuckett>	It seems that with the latest update of Protonmail Bridge, mbsync will no longer sync with it. I've used the same config for months, and now it doesn't work.
Feb 29 13:49:42 <rustbuckett>	And, I know this isn't related to Neomutt, but now Bridge in "syncing". Syncing what? It's a bridge! What is it syncing?!

Feb 29 14:41:37 <rustbuckett>	Now that the "sync" is finished, it seems that almost everything is fixed. I'm still getting 'INBOX: UIDVALIDITY genuinely changed (at UID 69)', and on several other folders. Do you have any tips on how to fix this? I seem to remember you helping me with a message move script that doesn't upset mbsync.
Feb 29 14:45:37 <rustbuckett>	would deleting the .mbsyncstate file just rebuild the local/remote sync?
Feb 29 14:53:28 <rustbuckett>	Or would that further break everything?
Feb 29 14:54:13 <bookworm>	ah yeah... it likes to do that
Feb 29 14:54:25 <bookworm>	the proton mail people aren't very good as far as that is concerned
Feb 29 14:54:31 <bookworm>	the bridge is a piece of #@!%$
Feb 29 14:55:24 <bookworm>	I personally nuked my mailstore and just let it re-sync everything, after having backed up my notmuch tags with notmuch dump or whatever the command ist
Feb 29 14:55:26 <bookworm>	is*
Feb 29 15:00:59 <rustbuckett>	Hm. Okay. That really sucks. But losing all of my notmuch tags was a concern. I didn't know about notmuch dump. I'll check the man pages for that.
Feb 29 15:10:25 <rustbuckett>	Oh boy. This is going to take a while.

Mar 04 16:06:44 <Maddie>	What would be the best way to add a macro to neomutt that will provide me a menu of contacts and automatically set the meta data (from address)? I suppose I could use abook for choseing the contact but is there a way to make neomutt detect the reciepiant and let me change the address? Because I could make a script to generate a config to be imported of "company_a = use professional mail, company_b
Mar 04 16:06:46 <Maddie>	= use personal mail" trigers/macros.

Mar 05 12:40:37 <roccoblues>	hi flatcap 
Mar 05 12:40:58 <flatcap>	hi roccoblues 
Mar 05 12:41:18 <flatcap>	how's it going?
Mar 05 12:41:30 <roccoblues>	busy as usual :)
Mar 05 12:41:44 <roccoblues>	how about you? Any end in sight with the expandos?
Mar 05 12:42:53 <flatcap>	getting closer
Mar 05 12:43:28 <roccoblues>	nice
Mar 05 12:43:29 <flatcap>	I discovered a random feature that I'd never heard of before...
Mar 05 12:43:40 *	roccoblues is curious now
Mar 05 12:44:07 <flatcap>	%_X (underscore before the expando letter) makes the text lowercase
Mar 05 12:44:21 <roccoblues>	wow
Mar 05 12:45:07 <roccoblues>	sometimes mutt seems to be half an emacs :D
Mar 05 12:45:44 <flatcap>	yeah :-)
Mar 05 12:46:05 *	flatcap is determined to make neomutt all VIM :-)
Mar 05 12:47:01 <flatcap>	and %:X replaces all dots with underscores
Mar 05 12:47:14 <flatcap>	I'm not sure how useful that is
Mar 05 12:47:14 <roccoblues>	yeah, let's add normal and command modes
Mar 05 12:47:24 <flatcap>	ooh!  yes!
Mar 05 12:47:47 <roccoblues>	c'mon %:X really?!
Mar 05 12:48:06 <roccoblues>	I'd like to see the original feature request
Mar 05 12:48:15 <flatcap>	hehe
Mar 05 12:48:45 <flatcap>	I didn't `git blame` it, but my guess is that it's "initial commit" territory
Mar 05 12:50:08 <flatcap>	549e98c86 Add a ':' flag to % expandos.  This will make sure that any dots are converted into underscores.  (_ is already used for lowercasing the result of an expando.) (21 years ago)
Mar 05 12:50:35 <roccoblues>	oh boy

Mar 06 18:16:38 <jindraj>	ngortheone: you need terminal with true color support and set corresponding TERM env variable, e.g.: xterm-direct. Then you should be ready to use hex codes for colors.
Mar 06 18:17:28 <ngortheone>	so I just use hex codes in the same places where old color codes were before?
Mar 06 18:17:38 <ngortheone>	jindraj: thanks 
Mar 06 18:59:31 <jindraj>	ngortheone: exactly. the main pitfall is you cannot use prefixes. if you used e.g. prefix$my_color like `my_color = blue` -> `bright$color`, there's nothing like bright#0000ff :D

Mar 10 11:57:10 <Guest97>	Hi. I'd like to start contributing to Neomutt but I'm not seeing any issues marked with the 'good first issue' label. I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction.
Mar 10 12:07:25 <vuori>	Do you have any particular theme in mind? flatcap is probably the best person to say, but how about something like https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/4163 ? The data the user is asking about is _probably_ available through the gpgme library neomutt uses so with luck it's just a matter of adding those items to the stuff that's already shown
Mar 10 12:08:08 <vuori>	Also expanding the current set of fuzzers would be nice to have if that's something you're interested in
Mar 10 12:17:02 <Guest97>	Thanks for the reply.  I'm pretty open. My own personal theme was adding some more features to match features I had in Superhman such as Send Later and Snooze for later.
Mar 10 12:17:03 <Guest97>	4613 looks like a good introduction since I want to make some enhancements.
Mar 10 12:20:50 <Guest97>	I'll start having a look. Well. First I need to build neomutt locally. Then I'll start.
Mar 10 12:20:51 <Guest97>	It says there are also mentors? How does that work?
Mar 10 12:22:59 <vuori>	I'll have to leave that question to flatcap since I haven't been getting anything done in a good while
Mar 10 12:25:12 <vuori>	I think send later/snooze would be welcome, but the still-ongoing backend/UI separation refactoring may affect those kinds of features where tasks need to be scheduled for later
Mar 10 12:27:38 <vuori>	ultimately I expect that they will be easier to implement at that point, because old Mutt code has those two sides pretty closely tied up and trying to use backend objects to do things in the background will often cause problems for the UI which expects things to stay put
Mar 10 12:31:44 <Guest97>	Got it. Do you know when the refactor is expected to finish?
Mar 10 12:34:06 <vuori>	nope, I've been totally slacking off, but things are happening in pieces so the parts relevant to you may well be done before everything is done
Mar 10 12:35:04 <vuori>	That said, the sending side is probably the easier side concurrency-wise. The biggest separation issues have been in the mailbox backends, where same structures have historically held UI state and mailbox state
Mar 10 13:19:56 <Guest97>	Got it. Ok that's useful to know. Will prioritise the Send Later feature - which is the one I want to do most anyways.
Mar 10 13:19:57 <Guest97>	Thanks for the help vuori
