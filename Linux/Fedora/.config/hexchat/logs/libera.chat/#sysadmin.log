Mar 04 15:43:57 <bn_work>	Anyone here manage Oracle 19c DB by chance?  Trying to confirm if Compaction actually reclaims free space to the OS or not, or that only just makes it re-available to the DB only.  Is the only way to actually get that space back to "re-org" (AskTom's term) the DB tables?  ie:  export out data, re-import?
