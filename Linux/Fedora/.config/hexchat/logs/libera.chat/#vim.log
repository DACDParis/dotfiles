Dec 10 15:38:06 <xerox>	m_ben: had a bunch of stmt; stmt lines, changing ; into \n
Dec 10 15:38:44 <xerox>	another way I know of doing it is visual selection then :s/;/\r/g but I was wondering how to do it with I, I tried some ways to input ^M or \r but that didn't do it

Feb 20 16:07:22 <tirnanog>	xx: do you have to unset tw though?
Feb 20 16:07:45 <tirnanog>	it may not have any peripheral effect, though it depends on your workflow.
Feb 20 16:15:51 <lopid>	it's also local to the buffer if you use :setlocal
Feb 20 16:20:15 <lopid>	oh it is already
Feb 20 16:26:37 <FakuVe>	Hey , is there an exit Status for commands executed within Vim ? (not shell commands)
Feb 20 16:27:21 <FakuVe>	I have seen there is , v:errmsg , But when scripting something , this could have been setted by other function call
Feb 20 16:27:51 <FakuVe>	So shall I set the variable to 0 , then perform the error check with this? or just 
Feb 20 16:28:04 <FakuVe>	There is an exit-code like variable
Feb 20 16:29:21 <lopid>	there's :try and various assert functions
Feb 20 16:36:08 <FakuVe>	lopid: cheers
Feb 20 16:38:27 <xx>	tirnanog: I don't know what sideffects it can have, so I'd prefer to return it to the state it was before
Feb 20 16:38:42 <xx>	anyway !fmt works, I forgot about having that executable available
Feb 20 16:39:27 <tirnanog>	fair enough.
Feb 20 18:36:00 <patanga>	why does even an exit with :q! change the timestamp of the file/folder? is there a way to avoid that?
Feb 20 18:37:14 <lopid>	maybe because of the swapfile. don't use a swapfile
Feb 20 18:38:38 <tirnanog>	I can't rerpoduce that.
Feb 20 18:39:02 <tirnanog>	then again, there is some abiguity in "file/folder".
Feb 20 18:39:09 <tirnanog>	and I can't type, apparently.
Feb 20 18:41:13 <tirnanog>	anyway, :q! does not alter the mtime or ctime of a file whose buffer was modified here.
Feb 20 18:48:33 <patanga>	tirnanog: yes. only the folder's timestamp is changed. the file' not
Feb 20 18:48:51 <patanga>	*file's*
Feb 20 18:49:00 <tirnanog>	which timestamp are you referring to exactly? there are at least three.
Feb 20 18:50:13 <patanga>	atime rests the same. mtime and ctime change
Feb 20 18:50:17 <patanga>	of the folder
Feb 20 18:50:32 <tirnanog>	it's probably what lopid said. swapfile and/or backup file being written into the directory at the time of opening the file within said directory.
Feb 20 18:50:46 <tirnanog>	you can configure swapfiles to be written elsewhere, if it's a problem.
Feb 20 18:51:20 <patanga>	i dont see any swapfile, if you mean this .swp files
Feb 20 18:51:34 <patanga>	*these*
Feb 20 18:51:50 <lopid>	you wouldn't, after the event, unless something went wrong
Feb 20 18:52:10 <tirnanog>	indeed. inspect while the file is still open.
Feb 20 18:52:37 <tirnanog>	.filename.swp would be typical.
Feb 20 18:53:16 <patanga>	lopid: right. there is the swap file there while the file is open. how can i disable that behaviour of vim , even in case something goes wrong it leaves me without a backup of the file?
Feb 20 18:55:11 <tirnanog>	define "directory" so that . isn't part of it.
Feb 20 18:55:20 <tirnanog>	that way swap files will be written elsewhere, and you can decide exactly where.
Feb 20 18:55:34 <lopid>	-n disabled the swapfile
Feb 20 18:55:39 <lopid>	s
Feb 20 18:55:39 <tirnanog>	say, ~/.cache/vim
Feb 20 18:58:12 <tirnanog>	to be clear: set directory=~/.cache/vim
Feb 20 18:58:17 <tirnanog>	or wherever else you feel is appropriate.
Feb 20 19:01:51 <patanga>	lopid: thanks. yeah, i could have found that myself. sorry.
Feb 20 19:02:12 <patanga>	tirnanog: thanks for the idea to define a swapfile somewhere else
Feb 20 19:03:18 <tirnanog>	of course, if you disable them, there will be no recovery safety.
Feb 20 19:03:21 <tirnanog>	keep that in mind.
Feb 20 19:05:18 <patanga>	sure
Feb 20 19:37:42 <maikel_frias>	that's a load of people
Feb 20 19:40:29 <lopid>	:%people
Feb 20 20:01:38 <FakuVe>	So I am doing a function taht is going to be executed through ~/.vim/autoload/something.vim
Feb 20 20:02:15 <FakuVe>	I need this function to get the fileName of the buffer with which is been called
Feb 20 20:02:26 <FakuVe>	(for that your would normaly expand('%') 
Feb 20 20:02:32 <FakuVe>	But in this context expand('
Feb 20 20:03:10 <FakuVe>	Is not working cause the execution environment of this command lies outside that file
Feb 20 20:03:20 <FakuVe>	Is there other way to tell which file I am working in?
Feb 20 20:41:41 <m_ben>	I don't understand, post some code
Feb 20 20:41:49 <FakuVe>	noremap <F5> :call myFile#MyFunc()<CR>
Feb 20 20:42:19 <FakuVe>	~/.vim/autoload/myfile.vim
Feb 20 20:42:25 <FakuVe>	function myFile#MyFunc()
Feb 20 20:42:30 <FakuVe>	    echo expand('%')
Feb 20 20:42:35 <FakuVe>	endfunc
Feb 20 20:45:39 <FakuVe>	oh yeah it worked
Feb 20 20:45:51 <FakuVe>	But previously it didint
Feb 20 20:45:54 <FakuVe>	such a weird case

Feb 21 04:43:50 <habamax>	with some vimscript why not
Feb 21 04:44:50 <habamax>	although it would require some magic as : register is readonly

Feb 21 10:46:53 <nerozero>	o/
Feb 21 10:48:05 <nerozero>	I got a weird question, is there a way other then clipboard to copy text from vim on one host to vim running on another ( via ssh ) 
Feb 21 10:48:25 <nerozero>	or on the same machine but on different tmux sessions 
Feb 21 10:49:17 <nerozero>	please don't hit me hard :)
Feb 21 10:49:21 <brutusmcforce>	you can run xclip through ssh
Feb 21 10:49:51 <brutusmcforce>	vim uses its own clipboard thing though, disregard
Feb 21 10:50:21 <nerozero>	yah ... 
Feb 21 10:51:03 <nerozero>	just looking for a way to exchange text other then mouse select of the screen
Feb 21 11:05:10 <lopid>	if you are forwarding x then you can yank to and paste from "+ 
Feb 21 15:17:11 <dumbledoor>	Given a JavaScript array of objects, how would you count the number of objects? Does anyone have a trick to do this? Example: https://paste.debian.net/1308089/
Feb 21 15:18:19 <dumbledoor>	Would you use some vim function or quickly write a function or perhaps you have a plugin?
Feb 21 15:24:23 <dumbledoor>	The formatting of the objects is significant. Both braces must be on newlines.
Feb 21 15:29:35 <dumbledoor>	A different question: How can I get a vim macro to replay until a certain line?
Feb 21 15:31:30 <dumbledoor>	For example I am on line 30 and I need a macro that does something like this. process current line -> 3j -> process -> 3j -> process -> atOrBeyond(70) ? stop
Feb 21 15:33:00 <stutz>	I feel like that'd be a job for a js plugin that shows you the information because that should ideally use some kind of ast. 3j -> process -> 3j process.. would only work for that one specific array with that one specific formatting 
Feb 21 15:34:16 <dumbledoor>	stutz: Ok, so something like nvim's treesitter textobjects?
Feb 21 15:34:56 <dumbledoor>	(or something that uses them)
Feb 21 15:35:12 <stutz>	the dumbest solution I can think of (again, only works for that very specific thing) select everything in [] and run :s/},//gn
Feb 21 15:35:35 <stutz>	assuming that }, is the end of one entry therefor the sum of all }, occurences is the sum of items in that list
Feb 21 15:35:52 <dumbledoor>	hmm, but this wouldn't work if there were more nested objects
Feb 21 15:36:22 <dumbledoor>	hey how can I use the vim command line to tell a macro to run or not?
Feb 21 15:36:35 <stutz>	it'd work if you included the whitespaces before the }, which again, really stupid.
Feb 21 15:37:48 <dumbledoor>	stutz: How can I check what is the current line number?
Feb 21 15:37:59 <dumbledoor>	I am trying the macro thing.
Feb 21 15:38:17 <dumbledoor>	using the vim command line that is
Feb 21 15:39:51 <dumbledoor>	Ok, it's line(".")
Feb 21 15:40:01 <dumbledoor>	I'll try somethings and get back
Feb 21 15:40:03 <dumbledoor>	later
Feb 21 15:40:30 <stutz>	idk what you're trying to do but you might wanna checkout tern.js if u try to get code analysis done for js
Feb 21 15:40:38 <stutz>	just throwing that one out, you have fun!
Feb 21 15:41:13 <dumbledoor>	will look at it stutz. thanks
Feb 21 15:51:10 <igemnace>	aww. they left, but the trick i usually do is just append .length then :'<,'>w !node -p
Feb 21 15:56:20 <stutz>	for simple js files sure but that wouldnt work for bigger code bases.
Feb 21 15:57:08 <stutz>	either way its probably a weird use case anyway so meh
Feb 21 15:57:19 <lairnc>	I have a problem with vim and I am not sure if it is because I am using it differently than anyone else:
Feb 21 15:57:19 <lairnc>	Let's imagine you are still getting to know the codebase of a project; you are still not familiar with the name of the files.
Feb 21 15:57:19 <lairnc>	You are editing one file, then you want to look for another file whose name you are not really sure. So you go through the list of opened buffers. You open one. It's not that one. You open the list again and enter another buffer. Ok. From that point, how do you get back to the first buffer you were editing if you don't recall its name?
Feb 21 15:58:20 <stutz>	:h ctrl-o
Feb 21 15:58:20 <digmbot>	:help ctrl-o -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#CTRL-O
Feb 21 15:59:53 <stutz>	fwiw when we talk about code you shouldn't really care about files/filenames but more about the content of files.
Feb 21 16:00:52 <igemnace>	stutz: re: bigger code bases, as long as you carve out lines you can :'<,'>w cleanly then undo after, it should still work well
Feb 21 16:01:58 <stutz>	sure, that'd work.
Feb 21 16:02:15 <lairnc>	the content of the file?
Feb 21 16:02:39 <stutz>	I dont have the use case where I have an editor open and I think *oh I need to find that file*
Feb 21 16:03:02 <stutz>	thats not something I care about, I care about function/class/structs/enum/variable/etc defintions. 
Feb 21 16:03:45 <lairnc>	how do you find a variable without knowing the name of the file?
Feb 21 16:04:03 <stutz>	using tags or a language server that finds it for me
Feb 21 16:04:22 <stutz>	https://vimways.org/2018/you-should-be-using-tags-in-vim/ 
Feb 21 16:04:40 <lairnc>	sometimes languageserver doesnt find the actual definition of a function
Feb 21 16:04:57 <stutz>	read link
Feb 21 16:05:38 <lairnc>	ok, im reading
Feb 21 16:05:41 <lairnc>	ty!
Feb 21 16:07:17 <japh>	lairnc, yeah, I had to do this hack for one of the servers today https://github.com/trapd00r/configs/blob/master/zsh/zshrc#L1452
Feb 21 16:07:27 <japh>	weird but whatever
Feb 21 16:09:31 <stutz>	huh? japh that seems wrong. phpactor doesn;t care about pwd
Feb 21 16:09:55 <japh>	maybe it doesn't, but what it cares about though is where you start vim
Feb 21 16:10:04 <japh>	this is because of composer and git
Feb 21 16:10:07 <stutz>	I can literally cd into the directory where the file is, vim Foo.php and then use gd and phpactor jumps to the correct location
Feb 21 16:10:17 <japh>	the docs say you can't
Feb 21 16:10:19 <japh>	:)
Feb 21 16:10:22 <stutz>	I literally just did it
Feb 21 16:10:58 <japh>	https://phpactor.readthedocs.io/en/master/usage/vim-plugin.html#vim-plugin
Feb 21 16:11:05 <japh>	Under "Composer not found"
Feb 21 16:12:15 <japh>	are you using something other than
Feb 21 16:12:16 <japh>	autocmd Filetype php nnoremap <backspace> :PhpactorGotoDefinition<cr>
Feb 21 16:12:17 <japh>	 ?
Feb 21 16:14:03 <stutz>	after/ftplugin/php.vim https://ctxt.io/2/AAAIBNThFA
Feb 21 16:14:33 <stutz>	the default mappings are at the bottom, nothing fancy, no auto cd hack in either vim nor zsh
Feb 21 16:15:05 <stutz>	also the doc is weird cos it says project directory not *root directory*
Feb 21 16:15:30 <japh>	autocmd BufWritePost *.php silent! !eval '[ -f ".git/hooks/ctags"  ] && .git/hooks/ctags' &   even this line can't possibly work for you
Feb 21 16:15:49 <stutz>	it also talks about composer and git *not found* specifically 
Feb 21 16:16:01 <stutz>	tl;dr it works on my machine (tm) :D
Feb 21 16:16:22 <japh>	yes, if I don't do my hack, gd works for what's not in vendor/ etc
Feb 21 16:19:47 <stutz>	https://github.com/airblade/vim-rooter is also a thing, you probably know about it already but in case you do not i just wanted to mention it
Feb 21 16:20:52 <japh>	yeah, I was using this already but no dice. I think it happens to late
Feb 21 16:22:10 <nerozero>	lopid, WOOOWOWOOW - that was massive ! 
Feb 21 16:22:48 <nerozero>	ssh -X + "vim "+y" actually did the job ! 
Feb 21 16:22:56 <nerozero>	That was really impressive 
Feb 21 16:23:07 <japh>	stutz, so, I tried your after/ script
Feb 21 16:23:36 <japh>	it didn't help one single bit
Feb 21 16:23:42 <japh>	weird how it can work for you
Feb 21 16:23:44 *	lopid jumps
Feb 21 16:24:09 <stutz>	idk, maybe something else doing magic that I am unaware of japh. honestly I just read your statement and thought thats weird, I never had that issue.
Feb 21 16:24:09 *	nerozero also jumps non stop ! 
Feb 21 16:24:34 <stutz>	didn't mean to "argue" your point :D It might as well just be another thing on my system doing magic
Feb 21 16:25:00 <japh>	hey, no worries at all mate, I would have prefered if it worked as well :)
Feb 21 16:30:28 <stutz>	oh japh I might be dumb but I don't use phpactor for gd
Feb 21 16:30:35 <japh>	lol
Feb 21 16:30:49 <japh>	just tags?
Feb 21 16:31:01 <stutz>	I just realized the mapping is commented out, so I checked the lsp status and et voila
Feb 21 16:31:12 <stutz>	intelephense: running
Feb 21 16:31:37 <japh>	wait is that another php server?
Feb 21 16:31:47 <japh>	I'm new to php, just getting started...
Feb 21 16:35:51 <stutz>	I guess so? I know only three servers rn, phpactor, php-language-server, and intelephense. the last one is what I am using.

Feb 21 17:01:28 <dumbledoor>	now
Feb 21 17:03:33 <dumbledoor>	thanks igemnace :execute works. Tell me, do if you have to do use normal mode commands in this manner do you use :execute norm everytime or is there a more common syntax
Feb 21 17:04:53 <igemnace>	:execute 'norm ...' is reasonably common. esp with :h expr-"
Feb 21 17:04:54 <digmbot>	:help expr-" -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/eval.txt.html#expr-quote
Feb 21 17:06:22 <igemnace>	depending on what you're doing though, it's not all the time you'd call :norm from vimscript (very very situation dependent, but e.g. expr mappings, macros, or eschewing normal mode commands for functions instead might be a better fit)
Feb 21 17:07:32 <Cheaterman>	Love me some macro abuse
Feb 21 17:07:48 <Cheaterman>	qq10Gq for your use-case
Feb 21 17:07:50 <Cheaterman>	then you can just @q
Feb 21 17:11:39 <dumbledoor>	I thought so igemnace. Writing normal mode commands together in a string looks very hacky. I wonder if every vim motion has an equivalent way to do with vimscript functions. For example, is it possible to move down a line from he command line mode without using j ? Does a function suitable for this purpose exist? Just wondering.
Feb 21 17:14:00 <Cheaterman>	normal/exec norm seems to be what people do for that
Feb 21 17:15:23 <igemnace>	in general: no, not every motion has an equivalent way with vimscript functions. taking a step back: what are you trying to achieve, big picture? i find that thinking the "normal mode" way, with functions, with ex commandline, etc are different paradigms
Feb 21 17:17:43 <dumbledoor>	I was just asking. My current objective is: replay a vim macro as long as the cursor has not crossed a particular line number. But I am trying this myself and ask for help on getting stuck by some atomic question
Feb 21 17:18:20 <dumbledoor>	will ask for help when I get stuck*
Feb 21 17:19:00 <igemnace>	sure, np. not sure your exact case, but e.g. :1,10norm! @q might be useful
Feb 21 17:19:18 <Cheaterman>	I find it intriguing that html syntax has been broken for at the _very_ least 20 years and nobody noticed and/or tried to fix it
Feb 21 17:19:36 <igemnace>	(doesn't account for your macro moving through lines itself, but maybe you can mold the macro to fit)
Feb 21 17:19:52 <Cheaterman>	Like, this would be the commit: https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/071d4279d6ab81b7187b48f3a0fc61e587b6db6c (RIP Bram <3)
Feb 21 18:12:05 <ash_worksi>	can I move directly down, highlighing 1 column in visual block mode across what would normally be considered a paragraph, `}`? Just using } takes me 1 line after the paragraph which highlights the current column plus everything behind it.
Feb 21 18:27:07 <lopid>	not sure what you mean. ctrl-v and gj ?
Feb 21 18:28:37 <dumbledoor>	Is it possible to go a few steps back in the undo history without undoing the steps in between?
Feb 21 18:28:59 <GranitePenguin>	this sounds like https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/20782/jump-to-end-of-paragraph
Feb 21 18:30:46 <dumbledoor>	For example I type A\nB\nC, then replace A with X, then replace B with Y. Is it now possible to undo X back to A without undoing Y?
Feb 21 18:33:39 <lopid>	i usually undo, yank what i want, redo, paste it
Feb 21 18:34:44 <lopid>	there are some undo plugins that can provide diffs i think (gundo, undotree) that might help
Feb 21 18:35:19 <dumbledoor>	lopid: oh so you replace the extra undone part with whatever you get in your register
Feb 21 18:35:35 <dumbledoor>	in that case wouldn't it be yank -> undo -> redo -> paste
Feb 21 18:36:11 <lopid>	if that's what you want
Feb 21 18:36:40 <dumbledoor>	that doesn't always work when the lines are spread over a wide range. i'll have to look into those plugings
Feb 21 18:36:47 <lopid>	right
Feb 21 18:37:11 <lopid>	maybe you could save the buffer as it was, come back and diff it
Feb 21 18:37:22 <lopid>	same principle
Feb 21 18:37:25 <Cheaterman>	I generally do what lopid suggested personally, if I have to yank a whole block as a consequence so be it
Feb 21 18:37:29 <Cheaterman>	but it's suboptimal for sure
Feb 21 18:37:30 <dumbledoor>	so manually make changes after looking at git diff?
Feb 21 18:37:49 <dumbledoor>	I see Cheaterman
Feb 21 18:38:08 <lopid>	go back to see that changes i want. save them somewhere (register, new file, etc). come back, restore at will
Feb 21 18:38:16 <Cheaterman>	It's always a tradeoff between the learning curve of a new plugin vs the "wasted time" of a known subobtimal method (for which you may already have developed muscle memory anyway)
Feb 21 18:38:26 <Cheaterman>	yes exactly what lopid just sai
Feb 21 18:38:27 <Cheaterman>	said
Feb 21 18:38:51 <Cheaterman>	Combined with solid use of visual mode (eg "visual inside braces") it really goes fast
Feb 21 18:39:56 <Cheaterman>	The "fun" part of what lopid just suggested with an extra buffer/file is you can then use diff mode
Feb 21 18:40:34 <dumbledoor>	But then I have to manually move the changes from the extra file to the original right Cheaterman
Feb 21 18:40:38 <Cheaterman>	Absolutely
Feb 21 18:41:08 <Cheaterman>	OTOH perhaps not but... that's what I do :-) could be vimdiff has ways to make that simpler too
Feb 21 18:45:01 <Cheaterman>	There's :diffg and :diffpu apparently
Feb 21 18:45:18 <Cheaterman>	There's also :do and :dp but those don't work with visual mode
Feb 21 18:45:45 <Cheaterman>	Generally :help diff is good (at least if you're used to vim docs)
Feb 21 18:45:45 <digmbot>	:help diff -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/diff.txt.html#diff
Feb 21 18:49:01 <dumbledoor>	Thanks I didn't think about vimdiff. Last time I tried that out for resolving git merge conflicts the separation of code using git conflict markers made by head spin. Since then I have strayed clear from it. But, it seems that it's slightly lesser complicated when not used with git. So, I'll look more into it.
Feb 21 19:08:44 <stefanos82>	greetings everyone. I have a question about expand(); I have a directory $HOME/tmp/various that contains a file named testing.txt and I would like to get only `various` directory instead of the absolute path...I use fzy and I face this nightmare with long paths when terminal is not maximized :/
Feb 21 19:09:31 <stefanos82>	going with expand('%:p:h') works just fine, but the full path is quite long most of the times
Feb 21 19:11:47 <stefanos82>	the interesting thing is that expand('%:p:h') and getcwd() produce the same results, but it would be interesting to have something like basename(getcwd())
Feb 21 19:17:03 <dumbledoor66>	stefanos82 Is expand('%:p:t') what you are looking for?
Feb 21 19:19:05 <dumbledoor66>	Or perhaps expand('%:p:h:t')
Feb 21 19:23:37 <ash_worksi>	lopid: no, I mean... uh... like this? https://gist.github.com/ash-m/2ed8fb837536360b4f31726a91f2aaf6
Feb 21 19:23:59 <ash_worksi>	hard for me to describe
Feb 21 19:26:54 <lopid>	ctrl-v would select the column in |'s
Feb 21 19:28:02 <ash_worksi>	lopid: I mean... that'll put me in block mode and then I can inch down to the bottom, yes...
Feb 21 19:29:15 <ash_worksi>	lopid: I mean, while _in_ visual block mode, and given your cursor is on the `m` of `|m|`, is there a way to move directly to the `d` in `|d|` ?
Feb 21 19:30:15 <lopid>	not directly. you could jump 4j
Feb 21 19:33:22 <dumbledoor>	ash_worksi did you look at this link https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/20782/jump-to-end-of-paragraph shared above by granitpenguin. It does what you want
Feb 21 19:34:57 <ash_worksi>	yeah; I am pretty bad at getting that correct and if you overshoot then it'll put me at the start of the line so I have to inch up with `k` and inch right with `l` many more times than just inching down to begin with
Feb 21 19:35:02 <ash_worksi>	lopid: ^
Feb 21 19:35:26 <ash_worksi>	dumbledoor: I did not, I'll take a look, thanks
Feb 21 19:35:29 <lopid>	i think it's the best you can do short of scripting it a bit like in that link
Feb 21 19:36:02 <lopid>	you could always make a number of short jumps *shrug*
Feb 21 19:36:46 <lopid>	maybe even create a mark before you set up, to you can return easily
Feb 21 19:36:50 <lopid>	set off
Feb 21 19:41:40 <ash_worksi>	lopid: yeah, that's another thing I've been meaning to ask, I read somewhere (since I have in my notes) that "`[  go to the last edited position (for example, the begining of a paste)" -- there isn't such a position set when you go in and out of visual mode is there?
Feb 21 19:42:29 <ash_worksi>	oh hell it's there in my notes
Feb 21 19:42:32 <ash_worksi>	I take back my question
Feb 21 19:42:42 <ash_worksi>	its `< for those who are curious
Feb 21 19:58:58 <Cheaterman>	Ah dang dumbledore is gone
Feb 21 19:59:04 <Cheaterman>	I'd have advised fugitive
Feb 21 19:59:16 <Cheaterman>	Learning curve is fairly shallow IME, and it really gets the job done
Feb 21 20:02:27 <Cheaterman>	ash_worksi: I usually just use gv to go back to visual, then o to select the right end, then ^C or ESC to keep my cursor there while going back to normal mode
Feb 21 20:03:37 <Cheaterman>	Also to navigate overshoots I don't spam l "many more times", I use w/b/W/B
Feb 21 20:05:21 <Cheaterman>	ash_worksi: Ah and yes I guess your main question is about o in visual mode
Feb 21 20:06:19 <Cheaterman>	About last edited position, generally ^I/^O serve me well

Feb 21 21:01:15 <ash_worksi>	Cheaterman: hmm, I wonder if `[ will take you across files.... I hope it doesn't
Feb 21 21:02:27 <ash_worksi>	... it does not. :)
Feb 21 21:02:37 <ash_worksi>	I didn't realize it's a mark actually
Feb 21 21:04:19 <ash_worksi>	Cheaterman: yes, well, when you have a litany of misc chars (like parens, underscores, slashes, etc) then sometimes it's easier to just hold `l` for me. Nonetheless I'll try what you're saying
Feb 21 21:04:37 <Cheaterman>	Well
Feb 21 21:04:47 <Cheaterman>	You could also... exploit said chars
Feb 21 21:04:49 <Cheaterman>	Do you know f and F
Feb 21 21:05:08 <ash_worksi>	yes
Feb 21 21:05:11 <Cheaterman>	Also do you know %
Feb 21 21:05:16 <ash_worksi>	yes
Feb 21 21:05:32 <Cheaterman>	Then IDK what to say haha, clearly you know better ways to navigate than holding l
Feb 21 21:05:39 <ash_worksi>	:P
Feb 21 21:06:16 <ash_worksi>	gv is supposed to take me _out_ of visual mode while leaving the (visual) cursor where it is?
Feb 21 21:08:46 <ash_worksi>	maybe mine is mapped to something... in normal or visual mode it highlights to the end of the file without moving the cursor
Feb 21 21:09:10 <pell_>	You could also estimate how far to go with 5l 5h to get close and then h or l the rest of the way.
Feb 21 21:10:55 <pell_>	But f will get you there more precisely, with a few times doing n if you have a bunch of the same characters
Feb 21 21:11:03 <pell_>	Like Cheaterman said
Feb 21 21:12:37 <ash_worksi>	pell_: yeah
Feb 21 21:12:55 <ash_worksi>	right now, I am trying to figure out what `gv` is supposed to do vs what is happening on my laptop
Feb 21 21:13:59 <ash_worksi>	I tried starting with `vi -u NONE`; when I try that, it doesn't appear to do anything in visual block mode
Feb 21 21:15:00 <ash_worksi>	oh .. it seems to go back to the last selected position
Feb 21 21:15:57 <ash_worksi>	even given that I don't really understand what Cheaterman said.... "o to select the right end" ... what?
Feb 21 21:16:35 <pell_>	left end
Feb 21 21:17:09 <pell_>	o takes you to the beginning of the line
Feb 21 21:17:34 <ash_worksi>	pell_: in what mode?
Feb 21 21:18:13 <pell_>	edit mode. are you still talking about visual mode?
Feb 21 21:18:26 <ash_worksi>	pell_: yeah
Feb 21 21:18:55 <ash_worksi>	I mean, my original question is regarding highlighting a single column of text
Feb 21 21:19:18 <ash_worksi>	pell_: like so: https://gist.github.com/ash-m/2ed8fb837536360b4f31726a91f2aaf6 (given the || indicate the highlight)
Feb 21 21:20:00 <ash_worksi>	pell_: also, "edit mode" == "insert mode" ?
Feb 21 21:20:10 <ash_worksi>	pell_: because in that case, "o" just types an "o"
Feb 21 21:20:35 <pell_>	ok. I've never done much with visual mode aside from copying to the clipboard, and I don't even do that with vim commands very often
Feb 21 21:21:19 <ash_worksi>	in normal mode it [o]pens a line, and in visual mode it seems to trade places with the start position of the selection
Feb 21 21:21:55 <ash_worksi>	pell_: I often use it to overwrite text
Feb 21 21:22:44 <ash_worksi>	esp in some form of brackets where I can just type ^vi(p
Feb 21 21:22:56 <ash_worksi>	(where ^ = ctrl)
Feb 21 21:23:07 <pell_>	I'm thinking of 0 (zero). It's hard to talk about, because my fingers just do it.
Feb 21 21:24:44 <ash_worksi>	oh
Feb 21 21:25:39 <ash_worksi>	maybe Cheaterman thought I want to select a horizontal line of text
Feb 21 21:26:18 <ash_worksi>	because I don't get this "select the (right?|left?) end"
Feb 21 21:26:37 <ash_worksi>	maybe they meant "correct" end
Feb 21 21:27:40 <jclsn>	Does anyone know a source for statically linked vim binaries for ARM?
Feb 21 21:36:40 <Cheaterman>	ash_worksi: So
Feb 21 21:36:45 <Cheaterman>	ash_worksi: gv restores your last visual
Feb 21 21:36:51 <Cheaterman>	ash_worksi: o alternates between beginning and end of it
Feb 21 21:36:58 <Cheaterman>	^C then takes you out of visual
Feb 21 21:37:24 <Cheaterman>	So, _that_'s how you can easily move back to a place you previously visual'd
Feb 21 21:37:39 <Cheaterman>	In your case you had visual block with a column
Feb 21 21:37:44 <Cheaterman>	So it'll alternate between top and bottom
Feb 21 21:37:55 <Cheaterman>	Not really assuming a horizontal line of text unlike what you just said
Feb 21 21:38:44 <Cheaterman>	ash_worksi: and yes I meant correct end, "right" is another word for correct as opposed to "wrong"
Feb 21 21:40:02 <Cheaterman>	jclsn: I'd cross-build them if I were you
Feb 21 21:40:23 <jclsn>	Cheaterman: Yeah just trying that with docker buildx
Feb 21 21:40:25 <Cheaterman>	Maybe it's just the Gentooligan in me, but I rarely find stuff built to my wishes
Feb 21 21:40:26 <Cheaterman>	Good idea!
Feb 21 21:40:32 <jclsn>	Too lazy to compile me a toolchain 
Feb 21 21:40:40 <Cheaterman>	Totally fair, but THAT you can find prebuilt easily in theory
Feb 21 21:40:44 <Cheaterman>	What are you targeting?
Feb 21 21:40:50 <jclsn>	armv7
Feb 21 21:40:54 <Cheaterman>	SBC or phone or other
Feb 21 21:40:57 <jclsn>	TV
Feb 21 21:41:02 <Cheaterman>	oh wow OK :-D
Feb 21 21:41:04 <Cheaterman>	so SBC
Feb 21 21:41:08 <Cheaterman>	Android or Linux
Feb 21 21:41:08 <jclsn>	Yes
Feb 21 21:41:14 <jclsn>	LG TV with webOS
Feb 21 21:41:28 <Cheaterman>	Oh uh so a very bastardized Linux
Feb 21 21:41:29 <jclsn>	No way to install libraries or mess with the rootfs
Feb 21 21:41:32 <Cheaterman>	Yeah I see :-/
Feb 21 21:41:37 <jclsn>	It is Yocto 
Feb 21 21:41:41 <Cheaterman>	Do they provide a toolchain through eg a devkit?
Feb 21 21:41:42 <jclsn>	Very old version
Feb 21 21:42:02 <jclsn>	There is an inoffical toolchain, but it is missing ncurses even
Feb 21 21:42:09 <Cheaterman>	Prebuilt toolchains aren't usually hard to find - and I do mean cross-build toolchains
Feb 21 21:42:11 <pell_>	@jclsn and you have to type with your remote control
Feb 21 21:42:12 <Cheaterman>	erf I see
Feb 21 21:42:13 <jclsn>	and I am too lazy to build one. Just kidding around
Feb 21 21:42:22 <Cheaterman>	Makes sense makes sense
Feb 21 21:42:22 <jclsn>	This is quite nice https://github.com/ansemjo/static-toolbox
Feb 21 21:42:37 <jclsn>	Never knew that you could use docker to cross-compile
Feb 21 21:42:52 <Cheaterman>	Seems pretty cool indeed
Feb 21 21:42:55 <Cheaterman>	Yes why not :-)
Feb 21 21:43:05 <Cheaterman>	You can even run non-native binaries on mac
Feb 21 21:43:19 <Cheaterman>	(caused the rest of us to have to add --platform=linux64 on our build scripts haha)
Feb 21 21:43:37 <Cheaterman>	linux/amd64*
Feb 21 21:43:43 <jclsn>	Uh static make
Feb 21 21:43:49 <jclsn>	Could even build directly on the TV haha
Feb 21 21:43:55 <Cheaterman>	Haha yes!
Feb 21 21:44:12 <Cheaterman>	You could literally extract the toolchain from the image, and make yourself at home on the TV
Feb 21 21:44:35 <jclsn>	Some other guys have already done that
Feb 21 21:44:43 <jclsn>	They did found the exploits and all
Feb 21 21:45:05 <jclsn>	There is a whole project around it by some Linux hackers
Feb 21 21:45:20 <jclsn>	Enabling Ambilight and some other apps on the TVs
Feb 21 21:45:55 <jclsn>	and I have nothing I really need it for, but when ssh into any machine, I WANT VIM
Feb 21 21:46:28 <jclsn>	It also makes me seem like a better programmer than I actually am
Feb 21 21:47:58 <pell_>	which text editor is installed?
Feb 21 21:48:13 <pell_>	or is there any?
Feb 21 21:52:38 <jclsn>	Ha worked
Feb 21 21:52:48 <jclsn>	Static vim on my TV :P
Feb 21 21:54:21 <pell_>	Vim, the Gentoo Linux of text editors
Feb 21 21:55:11 <pell_>	Edit configs on your toaster
Feb 21 22:46:52 <Cheaterman>	jclsn: congrats :D
Feb 21 22:47:28 <Cheaterman>	Pell's kinda right except Gentoo is the vim of distros :-)
Feb 21 22:55:45 <ash_worksi>	Cheaterman: so, firstly, further clarification, "then ^C or ESC to keep my cursor there while going back to normal mode" -- are you saying as opposed to going back to normal mode in another manner?
Feb 21 22:56:16 <Cheaterman>	Not really no :) rather as opposed to doing something else
Feb 21 22:57:20 <ash_worksi>	Cheaterman: secondly; is that all addressing when I asked about going to the last visualized position?
Feb 21 22:57:31 <Cheaterman>	I think so
Feb 21 22:57:44 <Cheaterman>	But it also addresses your further question about going from |a| to |m| or something
Feb 21 22:57:52 <Cheaterman>	since I explained what o does
Feb 21 22:59:09 <ash_worksi>	I think then you misunderstood the premise; I was trying to ask: having no previous visual selection, is it possible to visually select a vertical column of characters such as from |a| to |m| in this example: https://gist.github.com/ash-m/2ed8fb837536360b4f31726a91f2aaf6
Feb 21 22:59:27 <ash_worksi>	Cheaterman: or rather, I misconveyed the premise
Feb 21 22:59:50 <Cheaterman>	Aaaaaaaaah :-)
Feb 21 22:59:53 <Cheaterman>	Like a vertical f
Feb 21 22:59:59 <ash_worksi>	yes
Feb 21 23:00:02 <Cheaterman>	That would be handy asf indeed
Feb 21 23:00:35 <ash_worksi>	well, I'll add you to the list of people who tell me there's no native easy way to do that
Feb 21 23:00:37 <Cheaterman>	I'm afraid OOTB (and without some scripting) it's gonna be / and ?
Feb 21 23:00:42 <Cheaterman>	Well
Feb 21 23:00:46 <Cheaterman>	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21264034/vim-vertical-f-and-t
Feb 21 23:01:00 <Cheaterman>	There's a bunch of good answers
Feb 21 23:01:02 <Cheaterman>	Including a plugin

Feb 21 23:56:14 <ash_worksi>	habamax: `normal }k` isn't the best way to get to the last line in a paragraph?
Feb 21 23:56:52 <habamax>	nnoremap <CR> <cmd>call cursor(getpos("'}")[1]-1, col('.'))<CR>
Feb 21 23:57:47 <habamax>	it might be the best way to get to the last line in paragraph, but your example was to move to current position as well

Feb 21 23:58:01 <ash_worksi>	habamax: sorry, that was the intention
Feb 21 23:58:17 <habamax>	so you can use :h cursor() to position your cursor
Feb 21 23:58:17 <digmbot>	:help cursor() -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/builtin.txt.html#cursor%28%29
Feb 21 23:58:43 <habamax>	there is also getpos() to get position of, '}  paragraph end
Feb 21 23:58:56 <habamax>	and you can combine it...
Feb 22 00:00:33 <habamax>	but if former works for you, sure go for it
Feb 22 00:02:46 <ash_worksi>	so, firstly, in your map command... are you mapping that to Carriage Return?
Feb 22 00:03:26 <habamax>	in vim9script, which is what you're using probably: https://0x0.st/H5TZ.txt
Feb 22 00:03:44 <habamax>	ash_worksi, yes, just as a throwaway example
Feb 22 00:05:05 <habamax>	https://asciinema.org/a/fFFO3pWnrkw46ORET75qEyHCC
Feb 22 00:10:16 <ash_worksi>	habamax: I am guessing that [1] references the nth paragraph relative to the current one?
Feb 22 00:10:30 <habamax>	nope, :h getpos()
Feb 22 00:10:30 <digmbot>	:help getpos() -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/builtin.txt.html#getpos%28%29
Feb 22 00:11:13 <habamax>	returns a list of [bufnumber, line number, column number, offset]
Feb 22 00:11:50 <habamax>	[1] targets second element of that list
Feb 22 00:13:45 <habamax>	'} is the end of current paragraph, so getpos("'}") returns position of the end of current paragraph
Feb 22 00:14:32 <ash_worksi>	I see
Feb 22 00:15:44 <ash_worksi>	I am always afraid of creating my own custom mappings overriding useful native maps
Feb 22 00:16:16 <habamax>	do not afraid, experiment
Feb 22 00:32:14 <ash_worksi>	habamax: is there a movement-y key that stands out to you as natively useless?
Feb 22 00:36:05 <habamax>	I never use + and -, wouldn't call them useless though
Feb 22 00:38:01 <habamax>	you actually gave me an idea with your previous question, I was constantly annoyed by visual block selection with { or }
Feb 22 00:38:27 <habamax>	like if I want to prepend something inside a paragraph with visual block I
Feb 22 00:39:03 <habamax>	so I was doing <C-v>} to realize cursor went off and I need to correct it with navigation
Feb 22 00:39:28 <habamax>	so I have created a mapping that "fixes" it for me ;)
Feb 22 00:39:47 <ash_worksi>	that does sound similar to my problem
Feb 22 00:40:18 <ash_worksi>	though I don't really get what you mean in the visual block sense
Feb 22 00:40:49 <habamax>	https://asciinema.org/a/8SpnOueftAtZMICA3q4CtvCaa
Feb 22 00:41:34 <ash_worksi>	OH
Feb 22 00:41:35 <ash_worksi>	I see
Feb 22 00:41:47 <ash_worksi>	habamax: that is often my case
Feb 22 00:42:26 <habamax>	https://github.com/habamax/.vim/blob/master/plugin/mappings.vim#L81-L95
Feb 22 00:42:29 <ash_worksi>	habamax: you have to change that to `noremap`, right?
Feb 22 00:42:33 <ash_worksi>	drop the 'n'
Feb 22 00:43:11 <habamax>	nope, I did it for visual mode which is xnoremap + inside the func I am checking if visual mode is actually visual block mode
Feb 22 00:44:29 <ash_worksi>	habamax: I don't think I get xnoremap
Feb 22 00:45:16 <habamax>	xnoremap works when you are in visaul mode
Feb 22 00:45:33 <ash_worksi>	I see
Feb 22 04:25:12 <jmcantrell>	i've got an autocmd on TextYankPost and the regname is empty when using quoteplus. vim is compiled with xterm_clipboard. is there something special going on when not on x? i'm over ssh
Feb 22 06:38:10 <ccx>	There are no default normal-mode bindings for navigating the quickfix/location list, right? Is there some convention for them? Say [q ]q
Feb 22 06:39:12 <habamax>	I use ]q [q and [Q ]Q not sure about existing convention
Feb 22 06:39:30 <ccx>	What's the [Q ]Q ?
Feb 22 06:39:49 <habamax>	cfirst/clast
Feb 22 06:40:11 <ccx>	Gotcha, that sounds useful.
Feb 22 06:41:12 <habamax>	probably tpope made it popular
Feb 22 06:41:40 <habamax>	]q[q
Feb 22 06:44:08 <tanath>	i'd suggest also adding ]b for next buffer, et al, if you haven't yet
Feb 22 06:45:00 <habamax>	doesn't work for me -- I usually have too many buffers opened to find it useful
Feb 22 10:39:39 <m0norail>	This plugin contains a lot of bindings like [b and [q: https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired/blob/master/doc/unimpaired.txt
Feb 22 10:40:32 <sphertext__>	habamax may i suggest you give the fzf plugin a try. it binds C-b to displaying a preview pop up window, with all the open buffers and a prompt that runs a fuzzy finder in that list. the default selection is the previously active buffer too (for that window), so switching back and forth between 2 buffers is as easy as <C-b> <CR>
Feb 22 11:05:43 <habamax>	sphertext__, thx for suggestion
Feb 22 11:06:12 <habamax>	https://github.com/habamax/vim-select
Feb 22 11:06:31 <habamax>	https://github.com/habamax/.vim?tab=readme-ov-file#fuzzy-popup-finder
Feb 22 11:06:47 <habamax>	I use this, "hand-made" fuzzy finder, sphertext__
Feb 22 11:07:27 <habamax>	was fzf'ing many years ago though
Feb 22 11:07:33 <sphertext__>	oh yeah, that looks pretty cool. very similar to fzf 
Feb 22 11:11:36 <habamax>	and one less binary to rely on
Feb 22 11:29:14 <dumbledoor>	Is it safe to close the terminal without closing vim first?
Feb 22 11:33:02 <dumbledoor>	Hmm, seems like it depends on what signal my terminal application sends to vim (if it does) before closing. Ok, I will ask the tmux guys what happens on :kill-session
Feb 22 11:39:22 <osse>	dumbledoor: it's HUP
Feb 22 11:39:43 <osse>	I asked the very same question once and got a weird answer, so itested it myself
Feb 22 11:40:02 <dumbledoor>	Ah, thanks you saved me from going through tmux' source code.
Feb 22 11:40:11 <dumbledoor>	So, is vim robust enough to handle SIGHUP?
Feb 22 11:40:32 <dumbledoor>	How did you test it by the way?
Feb 22 11:41:07 <osse>	open a pane, define TRAPINT() { echo INT > file; } and so on for TRAPINT, TRAPHUP etc. then :kill-pane and inspect file
Feb 22 11:41:24 <osse>	(that's zsh specific I think, but could do the same with bash)
Feb 22 11:41:51 <osse>	I justr re-read the answer I got then, and they say it's HUP :P I missed it the first time
Feb 22 11:42:01 <osse>	"tmux does not send the signals, that is the responsibility of the kernel, and it will send SIGHUP"
Feb 22 11:42:07 <osse>	I don't understand the first part though
Feb 22 11:42:32 <osse>	 But it explains why my own code dive didn't yield anything
Feb 22 11:43:15 <dumbledoor>	Oh, so the TRAPINT() thing did not work as intended?
Feb 22 11:43:28 <osse>	yes
Feb 22 11:43:46 <osse>	one of those functions get executed depending on which signal is sent
Feb 22 11:43:56 <osse>	TRAPINT didn't. TRAPHUP did
Feb 22 11:44:22 <dumbledoor>	oh. are these names zsh specific?
Feb 22 11:44:36 <dumbledoor>	how did you get them to run when the signal was sent
Feb 22 11:44:40 <dumbledoor>	otherwise
Feb 22 11:45:31 <dumbledoor>	s/name/tokens/g
Feb 22 11:51:14 <dumbledoor>	Forget that, I'll read more on shell traps myself.
Feb 22 11:51:39 <dumbledoor>	osse: do you now do tmux kill-session while vim is running?
Feb 22 11:53:28 <sphertext__>	you'll probably end up with leftover swap files either way, if you have any modified buffers 
Feb 22 11:54:36 <dumbledoor>	what if I saved all files beforehand. Can the vim software itself get corrupted on doing this multiple times over the months? sphertext__
Feb 22 11:54:47 <dumbledoor>	months/years
Feb 22 11:58:27 <sphertext__>	the vim program won't get corrupted. your main concern is the swap files. actually even if you saved all your buffers, but the vim process hangs around after you closed your terminal, then you will be alerted when you reopen the files that are still open in the previous process 
Feb 22 11:59:21 <sphertext__>	ideally you would want to reconnect/reattach a new terminal to the previous vim process (instead of starting a new one), but that requires some complicated magic 
Feb 22 12:02:31 <dumbledoor>	makes sense. i'll check this myself by not closing vim from now on.
Feb 22 12:04:28 *	dumbledoor wonders if the G in SIGINT is pronounced like gif or gif
Feb 22 12:17:22 <osse>	dumbledoor: you can also just kill -HUP $vimpid  to test
Feb 22 12:18:27 <dumbledoor>	yes, but i do not care about losing data. i want to know if the vim program itself breaks the next time i open it.
Feb 22 12:18:39 <dumbledoor>	over time
Feb 22 12:19:16 <osse>	as in after 10-50 signals it'll degrade??
Feb 22 12:19:23 <dumbledoor>	yes
Feb 22 12:19:53 <osse>	sounds unlikely unless you have a PC made of organic material
Feb 22 12:20:28 <habamax>	the only "visible" issue you might have is the swp files that might get in the way
Feb 22 12:21:10 <dumbledoor>	lol. Ok, well anyway the main objective was that I should not be concerned about my running programs when I do tmux kill-session. And from now on that's just what I am gonna do. So, problem is solved.
Feb 22 12:21:52 <osse>	Seems like the proper way to do signal handling in vim is an autocmd VimLeave that inspects the v:dying variable
Feb 22 12:22:32 <osse>	hmmm... it doesn't tell you which signal...
Feb 22 12:48:30 <Cheaterman>	Very interesting conversation this morning ; the way I personally navigate is I have <C-n> and <C-p> nmapped to :bn<CR> and :bp<CR> respectively
Feb 22 12:52:04 <Cheaterman>	Also liberal use of <C-^>

Feb 22 18:43:41 <quesker>	it is in .vim/pack/plugins/start
Feb 22 18:45:40 <quesker>	I should turn this whole thing off
Feb 22 19:04:07 <quesker>	I tried an autocmd to disable it but the plugins load after .vimrc
Feb 22 19:44:01 <birkoff>	is there a keybinding that can take percentage to set window size  ? 
Feb 22 19:46:17 <Cheaterman>	sphertext__: Interesting, thanks! And yes I figured indent would be fine for Python hehe, the one that worries me for it is poorly-indented HTML, so I was really wondering if I could set foldmethod to syntax and assume all syntaxes have solid folding support
Feb 22 19:49:06 <Cheaterman>	birkoff: Not from what I can see in :help :res, sorry
Feb 22 19:49:23 <Cheaterman>	OTOH I'm curious if there's an equivalent to z{nr}<CR> for vertical windows - but I assume I'd have seen it

Feb 22 20:54:11 <Cheaterman>	birkoff: What an interesting question :-D - adding an alternate map to : seems to work as you expect on nvim but not on vim
Feb 22 20:54:16 <Cheaterman>	ie :nnoremap ; :
Feb 22 20:54:39 <Cheaterman>	ofc that's assuming you want the prompt to be the key you triggered command mode with
Feb 22 20:54:39 <birkoff>	I meant to change the prompt text itself not the command 
Feb 22 20:54:44 <Cheaterman>	Yes, see above
Feb 22 20:55:06 <Cheaterman>	either way to the best of my knowledge there isn't a way to either change only the prompt on nvim or change the prompt at all on vim
Feb 22 20:55:08 <birkoff>	what if I dont want that?
Feb 22 20:55:14 <Cheaterman>	Again see above :D
Feb 22 20:55:20 <Cheaterman>	But I'm not omniscient

Feb 22 21:18:41 <Cheaterman>	So many interesting things, like Ctrl+Q being equivalent to Ctrl+V
Feb 22 21:19:05 <Cheaterman>	Either way the colon seems to be very static, sorry birkoff - I haven't seen (I think...) the exact rendering code but I'm fairly sure judging from the rest
Feb 22 21:19:41 <Cheaterman>	quesker: you have getenv() in vim, eg :echo getenv("SHELL")
Feb 22 21:31:41 <hernan>	sometimes when i split a buffer and open a file, vim auto re-sets the sizes for every buffer.Is there some shortcut to return buffers to their previous sizes ?
Feb 22 22:21:54 <birkoff>	can I paste raw termcap options in a terminal buffer? when I try the control characters are erased. tried setting 'paste' to no avail
Feb 22 22:22:47 <birkoff>	I do it with: <C-w>"=&t_SC  for example
Feb 22 22:29:49 <birkoff>	why am I getting E16: Invalid range for a user defined command with -range=0 and values higher than 1 ? 
Feb 22 23:28:32 <birkoff>	isn't it weird that v:count is not mentioned even once in map.txt ? 
Feb 22 23:33:53 <birkoff>	is it possible to pass v:count in an inbetween binding? i.e. for map <c-w><a-m>  have it "understand" v:count when typing <c-w>4<a-m> 
Feb 22 23:39:02 <habamax>	it is always passed afaik
Feb 22 23:39:38 <habamax>	I mean, it is available at rhs of the mapping, would it be using it? depends on how you do it
Feb 22 23:50:46 <birkoff>	it doesn't look like it 
Feb 22 23:51:20 <birkoff>	I can do i.e. 3<c-w><a-m>  but not <c-w>3<a-m>. v:count is simply passed on from rhs
Feb 22 23:57:09 <habamax>	you're right
Feb 22 23:58:07 <habamax>	and the answer is, your normal mode command is not composable
Feb 22 23:59:20 <habamax>	if your C-w was in operator pending mode that expects a motion -- v:count would've been there
Feb 23 02:17:56 <birkoff>	how can I pass a flag with a mapping ? I'm already using count 
Feb 23 03:59:49 <birkoff>	is it possible to hide the command line when not in use?
Feb 23 04:00:05 <birkoff>	i.e. make it pop up only when pressing : and when it needs to show messages
Feb 23 04:05:37 <habamax>	no, it was possible for a brief period of time when Bram merged PR, but it caused too many problems and reverted at the end
Feb 23 04:06:54 <habamax>	I can't find PR though
Feb 23 04:10:14 <habamax>	https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/11543
Feb 23 06:22:47 <birkoff>	oh
Feb 23 06:30:46 <birkoff>	how can i save custom colorscheme modifications?
Feb 23 07:48:23 <quesker>	how do I quote this to expand $TMPDIR env var?   if match(getcwd(), $TMPDIR/pass.?*/?*.txt)
Feb 23 07:49:06 <quesker>	I just realized that is a glob not a regex
Feb 23 07:50:37 <quesker>	the real problem is that this just doesn't work  autocmd VimEnter $TMPDIR/pass.?*/?*.txt Copilot disable
Feb 23 07:52:08 <quesker>	that glob does match though
Feb 23 08:10:27 <habamax>	vimenter doesn't expect file
Feb 23 08:10:44 <quesker>	what do you mean?
Feb 23 08:11:48 <quesker>	au {event} {pat} {cmd}  right?
Feb 23 08:12:22 <quesker>	how can you test au?  like make vim do something simple that I can see if the pat matched
Feb 23 08:12:37 <habamax>	au Colorscheme <- do you expect a filename here as well?
Feb 23 08:13:44 <habamax>	use echom "some message"
Feb 23 08:13:49 <quesker>	k
Feb 23 08:14:05 <quesker>	I thought it always needed a pattern.  I never messed with au before
Feb 23 08:14:51 <habamax>	yes, but what this pattern would be matched against?
Feb 23 08:15:00 <quesker>	the file being edited
Feb 23 08:15:07 <habamax>	in case of au colorscheme -- with colorscheme name
Feb 23 08:15:20 <habamax>	in case of au BufEnter -- with the buffer name
Feb 23 08:15:46 <habamax>	but I don't know what it has to match in vimenter
Feb 23 08:16:09 <habamax>	I doubt it is a filename or path
Feb 23 08:16:18 <quesker>	all the ones I see have * there with vimenter
Feb 23 08:16:26 <quesker>	to match any file
Feb 23 08:16:34 <habamax>	not any file but anything
Feb 23 08:16:46 <quesker>	hmm 
Feb 23 08:16:50 <quesker>	very confused  :)
Feb 23 08:17:00 <quesker>	where would that echom go to if it worked?
Feb 23 08:17:07 <habamax>	:messages
Feb 23 08:21:16 <habamax>	why do you need an autocommand in the first place?
Feb 23 08:21:52 <quesker>	I want to disable copilot plugin when editing my password manager passwords
Feb 23 08:22:21 <habamax>	in a new vim instance or existing one?
Feb 23 08:22:34 <habamax>	cause VimEnter triggers once when you start vim
Feb 23 08:22:45 <quesker>	the password manager runs a new vim each time
Feb 23 08:23:16 <habamax>	go with bufenter then
Feb 23 08:23:24 <quesker>	ok
Feb 23 08:24:39 <quesker>	still doesn't seem to work.  I am just going to use g:copilot_filetypes instead I guess
Feb 23 08:24:58 <quesker>	but then no copilot in text ft.  which is ok I guess
Feb 23 08:36:25 <quesker>	I got it.  tricky glob
Feb 23 08:37:01 <quesker>	have to have exact right number of /
Feb 23 08:41:14 <quesker>	autocmd VimEnter /private$TMPDIR/pass.?*/?*.txt Copilot disable
Feb 23 08:52:37 <quesker>	I decided to not load the plugin automatically, so I did cd .vim/pack/github; mv start opt
Feb 23 08:54:07 <quesker>	much better to just load as needed I think
Feb 23 08:54:32 <quesker>	maybe in modeline 
Feb 23 08:57:35 <quesker>	hmm can you not do packadd in modeline?
Feb 23 09:07:30 <quesker>	haha    autocmd VimEnter * if getline(2) =~ "copilot" | pa copilot.vim | endif
Feb 23 09:16:40 <strk>	I've a problem with VISUAL LINE resulting in white text over white background, how do I configure this ? It's in a Kitty terminal, where highlighting text with the mouse has a nicer effect (black text over yellow background) so this might be vim specific. Even screen(1) copy functionality turns the highlighted text into black over white background. The default text is white over black. Only vim VISUAL
Feb 23 09:16:42 <strk>	MODE does this white-on-white thing
Feb 23 10:49:09 <lopid>	use a different colour scheme?
Feb 23 11:53:30 <strk>	how/where ?
Feb 23 11:53:43 <lopid>	:help colorscheme
Feb 23 11:53:43 <digmbot>	:help colorscheme -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/syntax.txt.html#%3Acolorscheme
Feb 23 11:54:22 <strk>	current colorscheme is default, how can it be so bogus ? I mean... it must be affected by something else ?
Feb 23 11:55:04 <strk>	yes: affected by terminal, as gnome-terminal doesn't give the same problem (Kitty does)
Feb 23 12:05:57 <lopid>	kitty has its own set of colour schemes, i think
Feb 23 12:38:03 <strk>	how does vim references colors

Feb 23 17:04:35 <Cheaterman>	strk: I have an idea!
Feb 23 17:04:42 <Cheaterman>	Are you using visual with mouse by any chance
Feb 23 17:04:48 <Cheaterman>	Try pure keyboard visual and see if it works better
Feb 23 17:04:49 <strk>	No
Feb 23 17:05:13 <Cheaterman>	OK - I was suspecting the terminal selection highlight was inverting text color from vim visual
Feb 23 17:05:19 <Cheaterman>	resulting in white on white
Feb 23 18:42:22 <defjam>	hey i am having problems with this code...i dont know what "k" means

Feb 23 18:46:22 <phy1729>	I assume you know what k in normal mode does
Feb 23 18:46:35 <defjam>	it moves up one line
Feb 23 18:46:48 <defjam>	hmm ok thanks

Feb 23 19:22:35 <ash_worksi>	weird question; is there a way to perform s/// on buffer contents before putting it?
Feb 23 19:24:04 <ash_worksi>	actually, that's not really what I want to do... I think what I want to do is overly complicating my life

Feb 23 21:58:15 <m_ben>	dza: romainl hasn't been here a lot the last few months, maybe twice
Feb 23 22:03:14 <absinthium>	What's everyone's favorite language to write in Vim?
Feb 23 22:03:32 <absinthium>	Barring English. :P
Feb 23 22:04:49 <absinthium>	I'm looking to get into either Common Lisp or Python, but it seems like Common Lisp users are all in on Emacs. Does anyone here program in Common Lisp with Vim?
Feb 23 22:11:12 <Cheaterman>	absinthium: I write a lot of Python and I certainly would recommend it over common Lisp XD
Feb 23 22:11:51 <absinthium>	Yeah, I wanted to like Common Lisp, but the syntax is very dated.
Feb 23 22:12:16 <Cheaterman>	that's the beauty of it in theory
Feb 23 22:12:17 <absinthium>	I guess I shouldn't debate the two.
Feb 23 22:12:34 <absinthium>	Cheaterman: And in practice?
Feb 23 22:16:00 <Cheaterman>	absinthium: In practice I prefer to bask in the glory of the features I implemented and how useful I can make my software, rather than in the abstract simplicity of the syntax
Feb 23 22:16:13 <Cheaterman>	Python is a whole lot better to get actual work done
Feb 23 22:16:29 <Cheaterman>	OTOH if all Common Lispers are on emacs and you were doing it on vim, I guess that would make you a... uncommon Lisper? :D
Feb 23 22:17:21 <Cheaterman>	Or in other words, IMHO a good language isn't about the simplicity of its compiler but in the complexity of the stuff you can build with it (and how you can tame said complexity)
Feb 23 22:17:56 <Cheaterman>	(put the complexity demon on a leash - _you_ say now, complexity _very_, _very_ bad)
Feb 23 22:18:23 <Cheaterman>	( https://grugbrain.dev/ - just realized you liekly don't have the ref)
Feb 23 22:20:25 <dza>	m_ben: oh, I hope all is good. Thanks for the note!
Feb 23 22:25:19 <m_ben>	dza: in general #vim isn't as active as it used to be a few years ago. people have moved on to other things or just don't use irc anymore. idk
Feb 23 22:25:39 <m_ben>	same goes for the vim subreddit
Feb 23 22:26:04 <dza>	* no one liked that *
Feb 23 22:27:07 <dza>	well still 700+ users thats something but it was over 1000+
Feb 23 22:28:00 <dza>	and I mean like weddit.. phew.. who cares.. why don't that site just die already.. its getting worse by the hour
Feb 23 22:38:20 <Cheaterman>	m_ben: I think the latter, I assume there must be a vibrant vim community on Discord
Feb 23 22:38:27 <Cheaterman>	OTOH it might be a nvim community instead
Feb 23 22:39:18 <Cheaterman>	2238 members on vi-tality
Feb 23 22:39:29 <Cheaterman>	And obviously 32K on primeagen but that's a bit of a different story
Feb 23 22:39:55 <Cheaterman>	It's gonna be about nvim but also Rust mentioned, Go+htmx stack of the future, OCaml supremacy etc
Feb 23 22:39:56 <m_ben>	prime... no thank you :D
Feb 23 22:40:00 <Cheaterman>	Hahahahahahaha
Feb 23 22:46:36 <dza>	if there is a vim community on discord... Its not a good one .. haha
Feb 23 23:22:12 <Somelauw>	Just curious, but since BM is no more, does anyone know who his successor is. Even Wikipedia doesn't seem to know.
Feb 23 23:22:57 <Somelauw>	or is neovim the future?
Feb 23 23:27:31 <m_ben>	Somelauw: https://github.com/orgs/vim/people 
Feb 23 23:28:29 <Somelauw>	so it's a counsel of 6?
Feb 23 23:36:31 <dza>	Somelauw: you can also check https://github.com/vim/vim/commits/master/ theres a lot of regulars that contribute
Feb 23 23:37:12 <dza>	Christian Brabrand was handed the `keys to the kingdom` (so to say) as Bram passed
Feb 24 00:07:56 <Cheaterman>	dza: I've had the pleasure to interact with chrisbra on GitHub, thanks to them I'll be fixing a long-annoying bug in html syntax
Feb 24 00:08:26 <dza>	Cheaterman: thats great, my <ScriptCmd> syntax PR was approved to.. after 2 years I think heh
Feb 24 00:08:36 <Cheaterman>	Haha, nice!
Feb 24 00:50:44 <absinthium>	I'd say 700+ members in a room about a 32-year-old text-editor using a dying/dead chat protocol is actually kind of amazing.
Feb 24 02:02:28 <andonome>	absinthium: IRC's outlived a number of forums. Vim may outlive any number of text editing tools.

Feb 24 12:27:14 <habamax>	looks ok
Feb 24 14:42:44 <tully>	wow irc in vim. Watever next
Feb 24 15:35:14 <pid1400>	hi there! can anyone please tell me why this vim mapping doesnt work : inoremap <M-Bslash> <C-\><C-O>dB
Feb 24 15:37:02 <pid1400>	hi there! can anyone please tell me why this vim mapping doesnt work : inoremap <M-Bslash> <C-\><C-O>dB
Feb 24 15:42:50 <lopid>	to do what?
Feb 24 15:47:59 <pid1400>	@lopid to remove the characters from the cursor position to the beginning of the word where the cursor is present
Feb 24 15:48:32 <pid1400>	inoremap <C-Bslash> <C-\><C-O>dB   ctrl key also doesnt seem to work with it
Feb 24 15:49:21 <lopid>	you should be able to just inoremap <m-bslash> <c-o>dB
Feb 24 15:49:33 <pid1400>	hold on lemme try that
Feb 24 15:51:35 <pid1400>	@lopid nah man, it doesnt seem to work. although, this one works inoremap <M-Del> <C-\><C-O>dw but this removes from cursor till the end of the word, the opposite of what i want
Feb 24 15:54:16 <lopid>	this isn't twitter
Feb 24 15:54:19 <lopid>	what does it do?
Feb 24 15:57:54 <pid1400>	your suggestion: inoremap <m-bslash> <c-o>dB doesnt do anything at all. 
Feb 24 15:58:13 <lopid>	m = esc or alt
Feb 24 15:58:29 <pid1400>	yes, i am pressing either of those, doesnt work
Feb 24 15:58:48 <lopid>	does it work with c- at least?
Feb 24 15:59:01 <pid1400>	lemme see
Feb 24 15:59:02 <pid1400>	brbr
Feb 24 15:59:04 <pid1400>	brb
Feb 24 15:59:51 <pid1400>	no. doesnt work.
Feb 24 16:00:04 <lopid>	what version?
Feb 24 16:00:16 <pid1400>	let me share the rest of my mappings? see if anything is conflicting with it?
Feb 24 16:00:31 <pid1400>	vim --version
Feb 24 16:00:31 <pid1400>	VIM - Vi IMproved 9.0 (2022 Jun 28, compiled May 04 2023 10:24:44)
Feb 24 16:00:50 <lopid>	try with a clean vim: vim -Nu NONE
Feb 24 16:01:15 <pid1400>	okay
Feb 24 16:02:23 <pid1400>	nope still not working
Feb 24 16:02:28 <pid1400>	does it work for you as expected?
Feb 24 16:02:46 <lopid>	yeah, vim and gvim
Feb 24 16:03:03 <pid1400>	do you wanna see my other mappings ?
Feb 24 16:03:10 <pid1400>	i dont know if anything is conflicting with it
Feb 24 16:03:29 <lopid>	it should work clean
Feb 24 16:03:40 <lopid>	maybe a typo when you're entering it?
Feb 24 16:05:08 <pid1400>	i didnt see i had a nnoremap <M-Bslash> dB down below. should i remove it and try again?
Feb 24 16:05:34 <lopid>	how could you have that in a clean vim?
Feb 24 16:06:19 <pid1400>	no sorry. i wasnt clean, my fault. i was talking about my existing config in my last comment
Feb 24 16:08:59 <pid1400>	i tried it with clean vim
Feb 24 16:09:57 <pid1400>	the backspace works as h key like, it just navigates around the text one character at a time. does not do anything

Feb 24 16:33:56 <lopid>	<c-o> dB
Feb 24 16:34:25 <lopid>	but the second try looks ok

Feb 24 16:34:48 <lopid>	does <c-o>dB work manually?
Feb 24 16:34:59 <pid1400>	yes absolutely, i mean not <c-o> but just dB
Feb 24 16:35:05 <pid1400>	i mean
Feb 24 16:35:05 <pid1400>	yes
Feb 24 16:35:06 <pid1400>	yes

Feb 24 16:38:19 <lopid>	<c-o> is meant for insert mode
Feb 24 16:38:32 <lopid>	(in this case)
Feb 24 16:38:36 <pid1400>	wait no i accidentally did : 
Feb 24 16:38:37 <pid1400>	yes
Feb 24 16:38:43 <pid1400>	but in normal mode only dB works
Feb 24 16:38:52 <lopid>	you don't need <c-o> in normal mode
Feb 24 16:39:01 <pid1400>	oh okay
Feb 24 16:39:09 <pid1400>	so yes, dB works in normal mode
Feb 24 16:39:17 <lopid>	does <c-o>dB work in insert mode?

Feb 24 16:41:43 <pid1400>	yes how did you get it?
Feb 24 16:42:07 <lopid>	by holding control and pressing o in insert mode, then dB
Feb 24 16:42:08 <pid1400>	if i hit i on my keyboard, it takes me -- INSERT -- mode
Feb 24 16:42:18 <lopid>	yes, from that mode

Feb 24 17:29:26 <Chipzz>	pid1400: this is IRC, not discord or X/ twitter. @'ing people is a twitter/ discord thing, it's not customary on IRC. Most people will however set up their IRC client to highlight on lines containing their nickname
Feb 24 17:30:56 <Chipzz>	and even if they don't set that up, all IRC clients I know of will highlight <nick>: at the start of the line automagically, which is why on IRC that style is customary/ expected
Feb 24 17:31:00 <Chipzz>	just FYI

Feb 25 04:46:57 <jmcantrell>	i'm running vim -c 'helptags ALL' -c q in a script. If it's in a terminal there is a flicker as it's presumably starting the ui then quitting immediately. if i redirect stdout to /dev/null, there's no more flicker, but i get a warning. is there any way to avoid the warning?
Feb 25 04:53:44 <jmcantrell>	it looks like i can use -e for ex mode, and it seems to work. i'm not sure what the other implications are. guess i need to read up on that
Feb 25 10:05:25 <jclsn>	Anyone good at patterns? How to match any number, be it hex or float or int?
Feb 25 10:11:06 <jclsn>	Ah no that won't be enough
Feb 25 10:11:21 <jclsn>	Writing syntax files is really hard. So many cases to match and exclude
Feb 25 10:11:56 <jclsn>	Want to extend this syntax filet to match numbers, but only in certain cases https://github.com/jclsn/vim-assembly/blob/master/syntax/assembly.vim
Feb 25 10:12:33 <jclsn>	It doesn't match memory regions right though, like 1004:
Feb 25 10:12:57 <jclsn>	I wonder why there is no nice assembly syntax file out there
Feb 25 10:43:45 <Cheaterman>	jclsn: I can do patterns
Feb 25 10:44:27 <Cheaterman>	But this is a particularly thorny problem and in the context of assembly you might care about weird formats like 0$ or whatever
Feb 25 10:44:31 <Cheaterman>	or #123
Feb 25 11:06:22 <lopid>	look at how other syntax definitions do it

Feb 27 23:17:27 <ring>	yes, I finished that for my own colorscheme and then realized a /lot/ of syntax elements link to a small group of highlights.. changing the value for one purpose botches something elsewhere
Feb 27 23:28:36 <habamax>	syntax files usually define their own highlight groups one can redefine in the colorscheme
Feb 27 23:29:25 <ring>	yes, that's the main issue, really. what is a sufficient level of depth for a public color scheme? rust, typescript, javsacript, haskell?
Feb 27 23:29:35 <habamax>	e.g `static` in c is `cStorageClass`
Feb 27 23:29:45 <ring>	there are so many syntaxes with their own unique highlight groups
Feb 27 23:30:06 <habamax>	they in turn link them by default to :h group-names
Feb 27 23:30:30 <habamax>	so public colorscheme has to work out whatever is in group-names
Feb 27 23:30:57 <habamax>	and maybe tune specific highlights of specific syntax files
Feb 27 23:31:10 <habamax>	that don't look good with default linking
Feb 27 23:32:06 <ring>	correct, but that is certainly a limitation. if you have many disparate syntax components, you reach a point where links to the built-in groups become very saturated
Feb 27 23:33:10 <ring>	suddenly, changing the color for Struct or Special affects a spattered bunch of things
Feb 27 23:35:11 <habamax>	it is, that is why one changes cStruct or javascriptStruct
Feb 27 23:35:15 <ring>	https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme/yats.vim/blob/master/syntax/common.vim here, you can see the saturation of Keyword, Special, etc... redefining many of these would then only affect typescript and you have other languages to sift through
Feb 27 23:35:36 <ring>	it's just a bit tedious
Feb 27 23:36:35 <j`ey>	then leave them as is!
Feb 27 23:36:48 <habamax>	fwiw, syntax file author are insane
Feb 27 23:36:58 <habamax>	s/author/&s
Feb 27 23:37:54 <ring>	precisely. more reason to reign in their chaos with an expanded (yet focused) set of highlight groups
Feb 27 23:38:06 <habamax>	usually, colorscheme authours come up with colors that suits "most of the cases" aka files they are working with
Feb 27 23:38:57 <ring>	I am working on a colorscheme now, so I suppose it would benefit me to behave like other 'colorscheme authors,' but this was definitely a demotivator for me
Feb 27 23:39:24 <habamax>	after 50+ colorschemes I am ok :)
Feb 27 23:39:43 <ring>	yes I saw your involvement in the colorschemes. I use ColorTemplate v3 
Feb 27 23:40:02 <habamax>	I am yet to try it out
Feb 27 23:41:30 <ring>	Colortemplate is clearly the best way to create colorschemes; it's relieving to use when you see some of what's out there... I suppose I'll just go through each language I care about and make tweaks where necessary, though
Feb 27 23:41:53 <nickspoon>	What kind of tweaks are you making?
Feb 27 23:42:13 <ring>	for my colorscheme; not for any syntax definitions
Feb 27 23:43:17 <nickspoon>	I am just curious to know what these necessary tweaks are
Feb 27 23:43:40 <habamax>	I would have changed javascript default links if I were using it
Feb 27 23:44:13 <habamax>	elixir is also an abomination
Feb 27 23:44:53 <habamax>	not the language, but the syntax hl
Feb 27 23:45:52 <ring>	string interpolation needs highlighting, the error propagation operator '?' is paired with exports/imports, highlights inside lambdas need some surgery as well...
Feb 27 23:46:17 <habamax>	am guessing you're about vim syntax?
Feb 27 23:46:18 <ring>	generic type parameters too
Feb 27 23:46:21 <habamax>	vimscript?
Feb 27 23:46:31 <ring>	sorry, RUst
Feb 27 23:47:03 <ring>	typescript needs some intervention as well; the colors don't map favorably in some cases
Feb 27 23:47:12 <habamax>	oh, never opened rust file so idk :)
Feb 27 23:48:01 <ring>	the sigil is also paired with Type or something like that
Feb 27 23:48:15 <ring>	so if you want &mut to have a purple &, suddenly half your file is purple
Feb 27 23:48:22 <nickspoon>	Rust needing string interpolation highlighting and lambda support etc. is a different issue, that's just something that the maintainer needs to add or merge if someone else does it. If it's missing completely and you know how to do it, submit a PR?
Feb 27 23:48:22 <ring>	unless you use the rust-specific highlight groups
Feb 27 23:49:31 <ring>	I haven't yet dug through https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim/blob/master/syntax/rust.vim but I think some of these (perhaps not string interpolation) are available for changing
Feb 27 23:49:36 <ring>	e.g. rustSigil is in there
Feb 27 23:50:26 <m_ben>	I agree, vim's default typescript syntax highlighting is awful
Feb 27 23:51:44 <ring>	the syntax definitions (regex) are there, but it involves an awesome level of granularity mapped to a small set of built-in highlight groups which takes all the air out
Feb 27 23:54:08 <ring>	some of the C highlight groups (PreProc, Include, Define) are adapted for use in other languages just to get a bit more variety
Feb 28 00:06:06 <ring>	https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-gruvbox8/blob/master/templates/_filetypes this, for example, shows what may not be necessary, but is certainly important for a widely adopted colorscheme
Feb 28 00:08:17 <ring>	javascript in particular is naked without those JS-specific definitions

Mar 02 10:31:23 <sphertext>	i yanked some multi-line text. and i have a table-like format in my file. how do i put the yanked text inside a column of the table, so that each line is inserted in one row of the table (without creating additional rows)?
Mar 02 10:32:49 <sphertext>	even if i do visual-mode to select the starting position in that column for each row, put just creates new rows for each line
Mar 02 10:35:45 <habamax>	did you try visual block?
Mar 02 10:36:00 <sphertext>	yeah
Mar 02 10:36:13 <sphertext>	it's kinda weird
Mar 02 10:36:16 <sphertext>	i kinda solved it 
Mar 02 10:36:41 <sphertext>	ok so
Mar 02 10:37:09 <sphertext>	you have to yank in visual block, then just put normally in the first row 
Mar 02 10:37:19 <habamax>	yes
Mar 02 10:38:35 <sphertext>	ok but now i have a different problem. this vimcasts says that in visual block, $ should select to the end of all lines, even if they are diff length. for me this just selects to the length of the last line  http://vimcasts.org/episodes/selecting-columns-with-visual-block-mode/ at 2:32
Mar 02 10:39:46 <habamax>	don't know about vimcasts, but yes in visual block $ select till the end of all lines
Mar 02 10:39:53 <sphertext>	not for me?
Mar 02 10:40:01 <habamax>	idk what setup you have
Mar 02 10:40:44 <sphertext>	ok i have $ remapped to g$
Mar 02 10:41:11 <sphertext>	to work as i expect it to when set wrap
Mar 02 10:41:20 <sphertext>	i think that's the problem 
Mar 02 10:42:57 <sphertext>	hmm but is only remapped for normal mode 
Mar 02 10:43:42 <sphertext>	ok apparently visual-block is under normal mode? i guess
Mar 02 10:43:49 <habamax>	try with vim -Nu NONE
Mar 02 10:44:43 <sphertext>	it's ok i just did `noremap <silent> $ $` to map it back to default 
Mar 02 10:45:04 <habamax>	https://asciinema.org/a/tsXX7oYTKO00xL2tzHSFRxmva
Mar 02 10:45:15 <sphertext>	annoying I have to change it and change it back whenever I need it for visual block 
Mar 02 10:46:47 <sphertext>	well yes what you did only works if $ is $
Mar 02 10:46:53 <habamax>	noremap is not for normal mode
Mar 02 10:46:58 <habamax>	jfyi
Mar 02 10:47:10 <sphertext>	oh i thought no = normal
Mar 02 10:47:15 <habamax>	nnoremap is
Mar 02 10:47:36 <habamax>	noremap == map that doesn't use remapped keys
Mar 02 10:47:41 <habamax>	`nore`
Mar 02 10:48:36 <habamax>	and map (as well as noremap) target normal and visual
Mar 02 10:48:59 <habamax>	:h map-table
Mar 02 10:48:59 <digmbot>	:help map-table -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/map.txt.html#map-table
Mar 02 10:49:24 <sphertext>	yes i think i need g$ in both normal and visual, in order to have nice behaviour with wrapped text
Mar 02 10:50:16 <habamax>	sure, but this was to clarify "ok apparently visual-block is under normal mode?"
Mar 02 10:50:37 <sphertext>	true. that was wrong 
Mar 02 10:53:17 <habamax>	you can go furhter then, remap $ to check if vim is in visual block mode...
Mar 02 10:55:25 <sphertext>	so.. mode() would return C?
Mar 02 10:55:33 <sphertext>	in visual block
Mar 02 10:55:49 <habamax>	something like: noremap <expr> $ mode() == "\<C-v>" ? "$" : "g$"
Mar 02 11:01:14 <sphertext>	oh..
Mar 02 11:01:24 <sphertext>	is that a control character?
Mar 02 11:01:55 <habamax>	C-v?
Mar 02 11:01:59 <sphertext>	"mode([expr]) [...] only the first letter is returned."
Mar 02 11:02:00 <sphertext>	yeah
Mar 02 11:02:06 <sphertext>	i expected it to return "C"
Mar 02 11:02:21 <habamax>	it is CTRL-V in vim's term
Mar 02 11:02:37 <sphertext>	that is considered 1 character?
Mar 02 11:03:30 <habamax>	yep, this is 
Mar 02 11:03:48 <habamax>	it is somewhere in the help, I don't remember
Mar 02 11:03:55 <sphertext>	so.. kinda like a control character 
Mar 02 11:04:10 <sphertext>	new mapping works nice, thanks
Mar 02 11:05:36 <habamax>	it is the last paragrpah of :h key-notation
Mar 02 11:05:36 <digmbot>	:help key-notation -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/intro.txt.html#key-notation
Mar 02 11:06:14 <habamax>	"The notation can be used in a double quoted strings, using "\<" at the start"...

Mar 03 13:21:00 <obiwahn>	i am using coc-complete with vim
Mar 03 13:21:42 <obiwahn>	And whenever I try a rename. the popup windows opens, but it opens at the top of the buffer.
Mar 03 13:22:24 <obiwahn>	now i wonder if one of you uses the tool as well and has the same problem or maybe you can give me a hint what to look for
Mar 03 13:26:13 <obiwahn>	https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/blob/master/autoload/coc/ui.vim#L30
Mar 03 13:29:22 <obiwahn>	What could be the reason that the opening the menu scrolls to the top of the buffer?
Mar 03 13:31:06 <obiwahn>	https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/4876 - it is like this
Mar 03 13:31:59 <obiwahn>	https://0x0.st/H7Z6.txt
Mar 03 13:32:09 <obiwahn>	^-- my vim version
Mar 03 13:43:41 <m_ben>	obiwahn: I opened that issue :D
Mar 03 13:44:14 <m_ben>	can't help you because I don't use coc
Mar 03 13:44:35 <obiwahn>	well now i doubt that it is the correct window type, it is more a small floating popup or something at the top.
Mar 03 13:44:43 <obiwahn>	but is is vim not neovim
Mar 03 13:48:57 <m_ben>	which window scrolls, the popup window or the current window?
Mar 03 13:50:25 <obiwahn>	The current window i guess, I am with my cursor on a word. And as soon as I start the rename the lillte new window opens up and I am in the fist line
Mar 03 13:57:38 <m_ben>	obiwahn: do you use the fastfold plugin?
Mar 03 13:57:48 <m_ben>	I remember having similar issues
Mar 03 13:58:35 <obiwahn>	I use something for folding, so i can open folds with space. let me check.
Mar 03 13:59:10 <m_ben>	I mean this one here: https://github.com/Konfekt/FastFold
Mar 03 13:59:17 <obiwahn>	no
Mar 03 14:00:04 <obiwahn>	https://0x0.st/H7ZD.txt
Mar 03 15:16:12 <obiwahn>	it is caused by editorconfig
Mar 03 15:16:15 <obiwahn>	WTF
Mar 03 15:17:11 <m_ben>	obiwahn: the new builtin plugin or some 3rd party editorconfig?
Mar 03 15:17:39 <obiwahn>	oh i have a 3rd party plugin is there editorconfig support out of the box now?
Mar 03 15:18:15 <obiwahn>	origingit@github.com:/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim (fetch)
Mar 03 15:20:53 <m_ben>	obiwahn: :h editorconfig-install
Mar 03 15:20:53 <digmbot>	:help editorconfig-install -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/usr_05.txt.html#editorconfig-install
Mar 03 15:21:18 <m_ben>	I haven't used it myself yet so can't say anything about it
Mar 03 15:22:15 <obiwahn>	digmbot: is that the same plugin?
Mar 03 15:22:15 <digmbot>	obiwahn: beep boop boop...
Mar 03 15:24:01 <obiwahn>	m_ben: do you know the source of the builtin plugin?
Mar 03 15:25:50 <m_ben>	run :packadd editorconfig, after that you can check it out with :h editorconfig.txt
Mar 03 15:27:11 <m_ben>	or take a look at the script files in $VIMRUNTIME/pack/dist/opt/editorconfig/
Mar 03 15:27:25 <obiwahn>	will it breaks coc in the same way
Mar 03 15:28:27 <m_ben>	idk, I don't use either plugin :)
Mar 03 15:29:18 <m_ben>	and I would open an issue on coc-complete's github page about your bug
Mar 03 15:36:39 <obiwahn>	m_ben: if you are not working totally alone then consider looking at editorconfig :)
Mar 03 15:37:00 <obiwahn>	I think it is really great :)
Mar 03 15:40:36 <obiwahn>	https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim/commit/7eec46701ec7a954a6cb0b0e348ad7c13a893425
Mar 03 15:40:49 <obiwahn>	maybe it is related to this commit

Mar 04 08:52:04 <osse>	birkoff: approx 4 years
Mar 04 08:52:33 <birkoff>	i mean from which version can it used ?
Mar 04 08:53:16 <osse>	8.2.1978
Mar 04 09:01:20 <birkoff>	thanks
Mar 04 09:05:57 <birkoff>	can I somehow use more than 1 returned value of a function in an expression in different args of another ? 
Mar 04 09:06:16 <birkoff>	i.e. something like  somefunc()->otherfunc(somefunc_ret1, somefunc_ret2) ? 
Mar 04 09:13:05 <birkoff>	never mind
Mar 04 09:14:13 <birkoff>	is it possible to start visual mode via a function call with a specific column range perhaps ?
Mar 04 11:13:38 <strk>	why is ">" not using tabs when <TAB> is using them ?
Mar 04 11:23:13 <habamax>	> uses shiftwidth
Mar 04 11:24:26 <habamax>	and if you have set noexpandtab and shiftwidth == tabstop then it will insert actual tab
Mar 04 11:25:15 <habamax>	if you have tabstop ==8 and shiftwidth ==4 then first > will insert 4 spaces and second -- tab
Mar 04 11:36:55 <strk>	???
Mar 04 11:37:07 <strk>	I need to take a master to understand this
Mar 04 11:37:35 <strk>	I have tabstop=2
Mar 04 11:37:57 <strk>	but I'm using tabstop to check with my eyes whether what I'm seeing are tabs or spaces
Mar 04 11:38:06 <strk>	so I go set tabstop=10 and see what moves
Mar 04 11:38:34 <strk>	> being affected by tabstop sounds crazy, is there any way to _force_ > to use tabs ?
Mar 04 11:39:36 <habamax>	https://asciinema.org/a/Z5le7qmsod8awlUgEidWKR4RA
Mar 04 11:40:29 <habamax>	tabstop should be equal shiftwidth, then > will use tabs (if set noexpandtab)
Mar 04 11:41:25 <habamax>	or set shiftwidth=0
Mar 04 11:45:01 <habamax>	make your tabs visible with `set list listchars=tab:›\ ,nbsp:․,trail:·,extends:…,precedes:…`
Mar 04 11:45:22 <habamax>	well, not only tabs but you should get the idea
Mar 04 11:52:40 <habamax>	:set shiftwidth=0 will make it use tabs
Mar 04 14:52:42 <strk>	thanks!

Mar 05 10:09:32 <nerozero>	then one more thing, can I make split new window to the right ? 
Mar 05 10:12:06 <ttkap>	set splitright
Mar 05 10:12:33 <nerozero>	thank you so much !!!!
Mar 05 11:36:36 *	nerozero blesses everyone who made vim possible and reads and responds to this channel
Mar 05 12:09:17 <OMGOMG>	what's the state of the art way to search for foo, keep the highlight on foo, and search for bar?
Mar 05 12:10:20 <lopid>	use some plugin (or just match yourself) to highlight foo separately
Mar 05 12:11:25 <OMGOMG>	thanks
Mar 05 12:12:54 <lopid>	you could also probably tenuously use some form of non-matching lookaround to get both with the same pattern, with questionable results
Mar 05 12:14:54 <OMGOMG>	ideally the foo and bar would be highlit in different colours
Mar 05 12:16:48 <lopid>	then the former
Mar 05 12:17:18 <lopid>	highlight foo ctermbg=blue      match foo /foo/
Mar 05 12:18:52 <OMGOMG>	cool
Mar 05 12:19:06 <OMGOMG>	i was mostly asking to know which plugins people used. there exist a bunch
Mar 05 12:20:03 <lopid>	it was simple enough that i used it as an example when learning writing plugins, so i use my own
Mar 05 12:21:08 <OMGOMG>	judging by the change logs of the plugins that exist it's not necessarily simple
Mar 05 12:21:21 <lopid>	feature creep probably
Mar 05 12:35:14 <nerozero>	lopid is there anything vim can`t do ? :D just kidding :D there is no such a thing, i know :)
Mar 05 13:11:37 <lopid>	:! can do most things ;
Mar 05 13:11:39 <lopid>	0
Mar 05 13:11:41 <lopid>	)
Mar 05 15:36:38 <tully>	Omfg how do you all use vim in an environment where CAPS can’t be set as escape?
Mar 05 15:36:51 <tully>	I can’t reach all the way to the esc key!!
Mar 05 15:38:20 <igemnace>	tully: you can also use <C-[>
Mar 05 15:39:01 <tully>	Awesome
Mar 05 15:39:11 <tully>	kind of awkward but it will work 
Mar 05 16:05:39 <japh>	tully, you solve that in the keyboard firmware so that it stays that way no matter what system you're on.
Mar 05 16:10:33 <lopid>	ctrl-c if you don't like that
Mar 05 16:34:59 <mjanssen>	ctrl-[ and ctrl-c are not the same
Mar 05 16:52:37 <tully>	I just remembered I used to inoremap CR Esc
Mar 05 16:56:59 <lopid>	surely it's harder to type CR that press escape. where is your escape key? cambodia?
Mar 05 16:57:09 <lopid>	than
Mar 05 17:18:56 <japh>	... that's weird
Mar 05 17:43:26 <tully>	I mean carriage return

Mar 06 02:05:30 <absinthium>	I'm trying to setup SLIMV and it says to copy the files to my "vimfiles" folder. Does this have to be the /usr/share/vim/vimfiles directory, or can I refer to it from ~/.vim or, perhaps, ~/vimfiles?
Mar 06 02:11:07 <habamax>	linux/osx ~/.vim/
Mar 06 02:11:16 <habamax>	windows ~/vimfiles/
Mar 06 02:24:29 <absinthium>	Also, does anyone have a Lisp IDE setup in Vim? If so, which one?
Mar 06 02:29:46 <habamax>	for lisp stuff I would go for emacs tbf
Mar 06 02:30:04 <nickspoon>	why?
Mar 06 02:30:05 <habamax>	it has established infrastructure and plugins for that
Mar 06 02:30:21 <habamax>	sly/slime + swank
Mar 06 02:30:52 <habamax>	okay, for commonlisp, clojure and racket/scheme
Mar 06 02:31:15 <nickspoon>	they're basically just repls though right? surely getting a good lisp environment running in vim must be a solved problem?
Mar 06 02:31:21 <habamax>	for newLisp and some others it might be not that compelling
Mar 06 02:31:45 <habamax>	well, I wouldn't call it just repl
Mar 06 02:32:04 <habamax>	it is kind of a proper repl, very well integrated
Mar 06 02:32:45 <habamax>	slimv tries to replicate it, but I never tried it
Mar 06 02:35:23 <absinthium>	Yes, I meant Common Lisp. I truly, truly don't like Emacs though. I tried it before Vim and I thought it was horrendous.
Mar 06 02:35:35 <absinthium>	I'm trying to get slimv setup now, but it's not running. :\
Mar 06 02:35:44 <absinthium>	Also, `vim-slime`.
Mar 06 02:35:46 <habamax>	emacs is... different
Mar 06 02:35:57 <habamax>	even with evil
Mar 06 02:36:25 *	habamax can do emacs in emacs way, but prefers vim
Mar 06 02:37:18 <habamax>	I was thinking to write an integration with swank to have simplified slime/sly in vim but it never happened
Mar 06 02:37:26 <habamax>	:)
Mar 06 02:39:37 <habamax>	vim has jobs and channels, so it looks feasible but it probably will take quite an effort anyway
Mar 06 02:41:36 <habamax>	you can go "easy" with a :terminal and mappings to send selection to it (assuming cl repl is in terminal
Mar 06 02:41:37 <habamax>	)
Mar 06 02:46:05 <habamax>	https://asciinema.org/a/uPEiCcecbixb9qg7ThyZQS8AO
Mar 06 02:49:39 <des_h>	does anyone know a vim plugin which can generate this kind of table formatting with multi-line rows? https://catonmat.net/ftp/awk.cheat.sheet.txt
Mar 06 02:55:21 <absinthium>	habamax: How did you change the terminal to vertical split?
Mar 06 02:55:47 <phant>	ctrl-w + v
Mar 06 02:56:38 <absinthium>	Oh, that opened another terminal next to the one that was already opened.
Mar 06 02:56:59 <habamax>	C-w H (or J or K or L)
Mar 06 02:57:37 <phant>	Oh change to it not open it
Mar 06 02:58:52 <des_h>	also C-w C-w will jump back and forth between the two most recent 
Mar 06 02:59:25 <phant>	Also, while we're on the topic, anyone know how I can prevent windows from resizing when I enter and exit fullscreen? 
Mar 06 02:59:46 <phant>	I'm on i3wm and it's a pain to have to hit ctrl-w = every time I fullscreen in and out 
Mar 06 03:01:10 <des_h>	not possible. bcus the implementation for window resizing does not implement proportionality (i assume you'd want to maintain relative proportions when changing the dimensions of your terminal) 
Mar 06 03:01:20 <phant>	:\
Mar 06 03:01:22 <absinthium>	Thanks! I think sbcl running in a terminal is all I need. :)
Mar 06 03:01:32 <absinthium>	Do these shortcuts have commands as well?
Mar 06 03:01:46 <habamax>	absinthium, have fun
Mar 06 03:01:55 <des_h>	phant: `:help todo` and search for `resized proportionally`
Mar 06 03:02:05 <des_h>	(it's on their todo list)
Mar 06 03:02:30 <habamax>	absinthium, you might check https://github.com/habamax/.vim/blob/master/autoload/term.vim#L2-L5
Mar 06 03:02:57 <habamax>	an example on how to have a mapping to send visual text to a terminal
Mar 06 03:03:54 <des_h>	absinthium: they don't. when you want to issue them programmatically from a script you use the instruction `wincmd [whatever you press after C-w]`. so for example `wincmd j` is equivalent to pressing `C-w j`
Mar 06 03:05:06 <absinthium>	des_h: Ah, thank you.
Mar 06 03:05:34 <absinthium>	habamax: So, by default, Vim doesn't send the information to the terminal running `sbcl`?
Mar 06 03:05:48 <habamax>	it is not
Mar 06 03:06:46 <des_h>	the plugin vimREPL provides commands for sending lines/visual selections into an interpreter running in another split. very handy for debugging python/bash scripts. 
Mar 06 03:26:12 <absinthium>	So, I'm trying to install `slimv` and it says to run: `let g:slimv_swank_cmd = '! xterm -e sbcl --load /usr/share/common-lisp/source/slime/start-swank.lisp &'`
Mar 06 03:26:42 <absinthium>	However, I don't have "slime" in my /usr/share/common-lisp directory. Only "gpg-error" and "gpgme".
Mar 06 03:29:52 <absinthium>	The tutorial told me to unzip in vimfiles, but habamax said ~/.vim would work. I've tried changing the directory in the command to "~/.vim/slime" but that doesn't work.
Mar 06 03:31:15 <absinthium>	Here's the full command I'm trying: `:let g:slimv_swank_cmd = '! alacritty -e sbcl --load ~/.vim/slime/start-swank.lisp &'`
Mar 06 03:31:43 <absinthium>	Note: the command `alacritty -e sbcl --load ~/.vim/slime/start-swank.lisp` works fine in Alacritty.
Mar 06 03:34:53 <habamax>	absinthium, ~/.vim/ is the directory on runtimepath,
Mar 06 03:35:27 <habamax>	in vim if you are to install plugins modern way, you have to put a plugin into ~/.vim/pack/WHATEVER/start/nameofplugin/
Mar 06 03:38:59 <habamax>	or use vim-plug
Mar 06 03:39:04 <habamax>	or minpac
Mar 06 03:39:09 <habamax>	or any other plugin manager
Mar 06 03:57:29 <absinthium>	Okay, I installed `vim-plug` via AUR, and I've added the following lines to my ~/.vimrc:
Mar 06 03:57:37 <absinthium>	" Plugins
Mar 06 03:57:39 <absinthium>	call plug#begin()
Mar 06 03:57:41 <absinthium>	Plug 'https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv.git'
Mar 06 03:57:43 <absinthium>	call plug#end()
Mar 06 03:58:13 <absinthium>	I've reloaded ~/.vimrc with `:source` and then tried `:PlugInstall`. However, I get an error about the cwd.
Mar 06 03:58:42 <absinthium>	"Error detected while processing function <SNR>16_install[1]..<SNR>16_update_impl[53]..<SNR
Mar 06 03:58:44 <absinthium>	>16_prepare[2]..function <SNR>16_install[1]..<SNR>16_update_impl[53]..<SNR>16_prepare:"
Mar 06 03:58:53 <absinthium>	"line    2:
Mar 06 03:58:55 <absinthium>	E605: Exception not caught: Invalid current working directory. Cannot proceed."
Mar 06 04:42:38 <absinthium>	Oh, I was able to get it with `:cd ~/.vim`. Sorry, this is my first time installing a plugin.

Mar 06 21:28:49 <birkoff>	i.e. for 2<C-w><C-p> the window focus should move two windows backward by index

Mar 07 20:50:10 <chowbok>	Really old Unix terminals didn't have monitors, just printers, so a screen editor like vi wouldn't work
Mar 07 20:50:19 <chowbok>	You'd have to use ed

Mar 09 16:50:34 <japh>	quesker, it gets even better using this https://github.com/andymass/vim-matchup
Mar 09 18:33:51 <FabTG>	Hi, is that possible that vim configuration comes from several concatenated files? let's say .vimrc1, .vimrc2, .vimrc3
Mar 09 18:34:36 <lopid>	just source one after the other
Mar 09 18:35:04 <FabTG>	and automatically when vim opens?
Mar 09 18:35:16 <lopid>	if you do it from your vimrc
Mar 09 18:35:23 <FabTG>	ohk
Mar 09 18:35:47 <FabTG>	just need to write source ~/.vimrc1 in the vimrc file?
Mar 09 18:35:57 <lopid>	:help :source
Mar 09 18:35:57 <digmbot>	:help :source -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/repeat.txt.html#%3Asource
Mar 09 22:21:38 <birkoff>	how can I cause a recalculation of 'lines' & 'columns' in GVim ?
Mar 09 22:21:58 <birkoff>	i.e. in my tiling window manager I enter and exit fullscreen
Mar 09 22:43:43 <m_ben>	":echo &lines &columns" always gives you the current values
Mar 09 22:45:14 <m_ben>	if you're looking for an event that is triggered when the (g)vim application window changes, see :h VimResized

Mar 10 14:39:39 <no_gravity>	I have vim folding set up to use indention and foldlevel=4. When I hit zM, everything that is indented gets folded. How can I only fold those parts of the buffer that are indented with at least 8 spaces?
Mar 10 14:42:10 <no_gravity>	Or in other words: How do I only fold those parts of the buffer that are indented twice?
Mar 10 14:52:56 <igemnace>	no_gravity: you can just :set foldlevel=1
Mar 10 14:55:11 <no_gravity>	igemnace: In my tests, foldlevel has no impact on what is folded at all.
Mar 10 14:56:43 <no_gravity>	igemnace: I start with "vim --clean" and then ":set foldmethod=indent". Then when I press zM, everything indented by more than 4 spaced gets indented. No matter what I set foldlevel to.
Mar 10 15:01:20 <igemnace>	zM changes foldlevel
Mar 10 15:01:23 <igemnace>	no_gravity: ^
Mar 10 15:01:58 <no_gravity>	Ah!
Mar 10 15:02:40 <no_gravity>	Is that all zM does? Set the foldlevel to 0?
Mar 10 15:06:05 <igemnace>	looks like it, basing off :h zM
Mar 10 15:06:05 <digmbot>	:help zM -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/fold.txt.html#zM
Mar 10 15:06:32 <no_gravity>	igemnace: Perfect. That solves my use case.
Mar 10 15:06:44 <no_gravity>	I just have to zM and then zr to see a bit more. Great.
Mar 10 15:10:15 <no_gravity>	I wish I could style the folded lines differently. Just a [+] would be cool. Without any additional info.
Mar 10 15:12:38 <no_gravity>	Oh, this looks good: set foldtext="+ "
Mar 10 15:13:17 <no_gravity>	Its a bit better than before. But it still shows "4 lines folded". Wonder if I can get rid of that too.
Mar 10 15:16:51 <no_gravity>	Even better: set foldtext='+'
Mar 10 15:50:05 <chiselfuse>	i sometimes type in arabic in vim and i have to constantly switch layouts because command mode expects english bindings. does anyone have a .vimrc section that maps the respective QWERTY arabic characters to the vim ones in command mode? or even better, one that maps keys agnostic of the current locale to their respective commands in command mode=
Mar 10 15:56:32 <chiselfuse>	hmm, i found that there is a feature to tell vim to switch to a certain language only when in insert mode but i'd rather not have a different vim-language-switch in addition to the OS one
Mar 10 15:57:24 <chiselfuse>	do i just manually alias all of them?
Mar 10 16:42:28 <tedwing>	chiselfuse: It's possible to change the layout within Vim using :h 'keymap'. Otherwise, the layout could be changed at the OS level with something like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64242110/vim-switch-keyboard-layout-in-normal-mode
Mar 10 16:42:28 <digmbot>	:help 'keymap'. -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/options.txt.html#%27keymap%27
Mar 10 16:44:10 <tedwing>	Actually, I think the one I wanted was :h 'langmap'
Mar 10 16:44:10 <digmbot>	:help 'langmap' -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/options.txt.html#%27langmap%27
Mar 10 16:59:37 <chiselfuse>	tedwing: hmm, can i have conditionals in this `function! ... endfunction`? can i call an external script to check currently set layout and branch if statement based on that?
Mar 10 17:12:02 <tedwing>	chiselfuse: Yes, if you're going to set something up in Vimscript to change the OS layout, you can use conditionals and get the output of an external script with :h system( . The key for command mode would be the CmdlineEnter and CmdlineLeave autocmds. But it's also possible that an existing Vim plugin could satisfy your use case. There's some more information in this answer:

Mar 10 17:27:43 <pid1400>	hey anyone please tell me how do i set vim to show the current directory of the file always, while im editing the file
Mar 10 17:30:38 <pid1400>	lopid
Mar 10 17:31:12 <lopid>	always?
Mar 10 17:32:06 <pid1400>	yeah like, what i mean is, suppose im editing a file /home/user/Documents/file.txt , so if i vi file.txt, at the bottom can it show /home/user/Documents/file.txt
Mar 10 17:33:33 <lopid>	you can add it to the :help 'statusline'
Mar 10 17:33:33 <digmbot>	:help 'statusline' -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/options.txt.html#%27statusline%27
Mar 10 17:34:03 <lopid>	%F
Mar 10 17:35:37 <pid1400>	but if i do that, this is whats happening
Mar 10 17:36:04 <pid1400>	if i do vi /home/user/Docs/file.txt from suppose /home/anotheruser/Docs/
Mar 10 17:36:12 <pid1400>	then the status is /home/anotheruser/Docs
Mar 10 17:36:21 <pid1400>	instead of the directory of the file
Mar 10 17:36:48 <lopid>	vi or vim?
Mar 10 17:36:51 <pid1400>	vi
Mar 10 17:36:57 <pid1400>	vim
Mar 10 17:37:02 <pid1400>	sorry, vim
Mar 10 17:37:17 <pid1400>	i added vi aliased to vim in my zshrc. sorry for the confusion
Mar 10 17:37:52 <lopid>	`vim -Nu NONE /home/user/Docs/file.txt` then `:set laststatus=2 stl=%F`
Mar 10 17:39:53 <pid1400>	works! thank you lopid
