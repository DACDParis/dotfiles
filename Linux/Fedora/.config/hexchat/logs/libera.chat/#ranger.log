Feb 22 15:23:02 <vifon>	__monty__: Any objections against me pushing this change to master?  https://github.com/vifon/ranger/commit/38bb8901004b75a407ffee4b9e176bc0a436cb15
Feb 22 15:23:14 <vifon>	This is exactly how :scout handles that already.
Feb 22 15:37:56 <__monty__>	Ship it.
Feb 22 15:38:32 <__monty__>	Though ideally you open a PR and add it to the 1.9.4 milestone. Eases changelog bookkeeping.
Feb 22 15:38:49 <__monty__>	You can self-merge though.
Feb 22 15:39:10 <__monty__>	And I think CI is currently borked.
Feb 22 15:40:30 <vifon>	…whoa.  https://einval.eu/upload/836217915-image-oaqvwuax.png
Feb 22 15:40:38 <vifon>	I don't know Github anymore.
Feb 22 15:41:07 <vifon>	birkoff: The fix for your problem just landed on master. :)
Feb 22 15:41:30 <vifon>	Good catch, it was quite bad to crash on any incomplete regexp.
Feb 22 15:42:03 <__monty__>	I faintly remember an issue about this. So check the open issues as well, please.
Feb 22 15:42:19 <vifon>	I will!
Feb 22 15:43:47 <vifon>	Yep, you remembered correctly.
