Feb 22 09:43:44 <[twisti]>	does vscode not have a view for tasks the way it does for launch configs ?
Feb 22 09:44:49 <[twisti]>	alternatively: i am working on a webpack project, so i always run a task that builds it via webpack-hmr, and then a launch task that launches chrome plus debugger. is there a way to combine the two ? launching chrome needs to wait for webpack to finish running, so its not super trivial
Feb 22 11:39:58 <Ecko>	If there's a warning or an error with an open file, it turns the color yellow or red respectively. How do I disable this?

Mar 02 17:39:38 <delvinj>	Hello. Does VSCode have anything like Sublime's python console, where you can evaluate snippets against the editor itself without having to create an extension?
Mar 02 17:39:38 <delvinj>	For example, I'd like to run `editor.selection.active` and see the result in an output window or replacing the selection.
Mar 02 17:39:39 <delvinj>	Thanks in advance.

Mar 03 08:36:57 <jonnj>	Hi. Does anyone have a clue why "Run without Debugging" is no longer working for me, it looks like the debugger is running but the red square will not stop it. I have to stop it from the menu. This seemed to start happening after the last update. "RUN AND DEBUG" is "Run current file" which is index.js. Thanks in advance for any help.
Mar 03 13:04:21 <rawtaz>	jonnj: sorry i have no idea, never used that stuff. maybe downgrade to the previous version?

Mar 06 15:47:54 <FueraDeServicio>	Hi. I'm trying to avoid having a word highlighted with transparency when I click on it in the editor area. I would like it to only do this when I double-click, regardless of the case.
Mar 06 15:48:06 <FueraDeServicio>	this is an example: https://imgur.com/MybrOZd
Mar 06 15:48:24 <FueraDeServicio>	could somebody help me, please? thanks in advance!
Mar 06 16:16:08 <[twisti]>	FueraDeServicio: there are two colours, one for clicked on, another for selected, so you should be able to change the 'selected' variant to be transparent
Mar 06 16:16:57 <[twisti]>	i think its either editor.selectionBackground or editor.selectionHighlightBackground, maybe play around with those
Mar 06 16:21:54 <FueraDeServicio>	Thanks for your help [twisti]. Actually, I think that disabling editor.occurrencesHighlight is enough for me. Now it only highlights only when I doble-clic on the word, and marks any existing repetition
Mar 06 16:22:25 <FueraDeServicio>	enyway, I will save your idea just in case it's not actually whan I'm looking for
Mar 06 16:22:35 <FueraDeServicio>	thanks enyway for your help :)

Mar 09 22:43:59 <acalbaza>	having trouble getting extensions to install inside my devcontainer when its built. however, i can install them directly. is it supposed to work this way?! 
Mar 09 22:50:16 <rawtaz>	is it supposed to work in what way?
Mar 09 22:50:42 <rawtaz>	if you are asking "am i supposed to be able to install extensions in my devcontainer?" then the answer is yes.
Mar 09 22:50:49 <acalbaza>	having to explicitly install extensions for my devcontainer rather than having them install when it builds
Mar 09 22:51:10 <rawtaz>	i dont do that. i put them in the devcontianer config and they install as they shoudld
Mar 09 22:52:35 <acalbaza>	i have them defined in my devcontainer.json, but they don't install for some reason... ~/.vscode-server/extensions/extensions.json is empty after rebuilding.
Mar 09 22:53:14 <rawtaz>	okay. i guess you did something wrong or there is a bug in vs code or the devcontainer extension then
Mar 09 22:53:26 <rawtaz>	it worked for me last time i used it, thats really all i know at this point in time :)

Mar 11 11:22:52 <[twisti]>	any way to use vscode to connect to a remote system via ssh without leaving the vscode server binaries on the remote system ?
Mar 11 17:55:58 <rawtaz>	[twisti]: Remote: SSH - does that leave binaries on the remote system? i thought it just shuffled files over SSH or SFTP.
Mar 11 18:09:08 <[twisti]>	rawtaz: yeah, it installs vscode on the remote somewhere, i forgot where. maybe ~/.vscode ?
Mar 11 18:59:02 <rawtaz>	[twisti]: TIL :>
Mar 11 18:59:13 <rawtaz>	it sure says right on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh
Mar 11 18:59:51 <rawtaz>	perhaps you want to use something like https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liximomo.sftp instead
Mar 11 19:07:32 <rawtaz>	[twisti]: i must say im not very keen on having vs code execute stuff on my servers.
Mar 11 22:41:28 <[twisti]>	ill check it out, thanks

Mar 12 18:40:20 <jmcgee>	hello
Mar 12 18:40:48 <jmcgee>	when using devcontainers and i plan to edit a repo across different workstations, should i put the devcontainer settings in the repo?
Mar 12 18:41:05 <jmcgee>	it doesnt seem to carry across different workstations in the user configuration directory, unless i am doing something incorrect?
Mar 12 22:24:56 <rawtaz>	jmcgee: it sure wont, since the user settings are just stored in your user and not somewhere else, unless you sync them of course.
Mar 12 22:25:15 <rawtaz>	you can store the settings in the git repo if thats easier for you. i dont know what vs code has in terms of settings sync.
Mar 13 01:28:58 <jmcgee>	rawtaz: ya thats what i found.  thank you for the response. :)

Mar 14 17:55:10 <pgloor>	In some editors I have collapsable ranges. Now I have the situation that when I scoll down, the line at the point where the collapsable range begins, stays fix there and only the rest scrolls. In some situation this can be very annoying.
Mar 14 17:55:19 <pgloor>	Is there an option that let me disable this behavior?
Mar 14 18:27:30 <pgloor>	I tried to change the Editor Folding options, but none of them helped to solve the issue. Well, looks like I have to live with it :(

Mar 14 21:11:24 <faceface>	How do I write ^M correctly inside vscode to get written to my bash script?

Mar 14 22:49:28 <arkanoid>	seems like if parsing is completely broken but vscode keeps in trying working with it
Mar 14 22:50:32 <arkanoid>	could you please help me understand what is going on with my setup? I tried to reduce the context to bare minumum, but still

Mar 14 23:09:32 <rawtaz>	the "itor" coloring?
Mar 14 23:10:17 <rawtaz>	what file type/suffix is this file?
Mar 14 23:10:31 <arkanoid>	rawtaz: there are also other wrong colors on the right, but this is just a line, my whole notebook is like this
Mar 14 23:10:35 <arkanoid>	ipynb
Mar 14 23:11:18 <arkanoid>	the execution of the cell is correct, the code behaves correctly, but I would rather disable all extensions than writing python code with all wrong colors and false positive errors
Mar 14 23:38:27 <rawtaz>	are you going to answer all of my questions?
Mar 14 23:38:36 <rawtaz>	oh, you did. im stupid
Mar 14 23:38:52 <rawtaz>	i never used jupyter, but i presume that ipynb is a suffix
Mar 14 23:39:26 <rawtaz>	if you change the filename to end with .py does the colors behave correctly (and perhaps need to comment out non-python stuff)?
Mar 14 23:39:36 <rawtaz>	just curious if it's a problem with just those file types
Mar 15 00:38:56 <arkanoid>	rawtaz: I'd guess you never used a python noteboko
Mar 15 00:43:57 <rawtaz>	absolutely not.
Mar 15 00:50:32 <rawtaz>	i stopped using python many years ago due to how bad the ecosystem was. i still love the language but have better things to spend my time on than ten flavors of package managers, for example :)
Mar 15 00:50:39 <rawtaz>	sorry i couldnt help ya. bye
Mar 15 00:50:40 *	rawtaz &
Mar 15 02:45:50 <arkanoid>	rawtaz: gratitude for your attempt. I also dislike python explosion of ways to build devenv, but with modern tools it got lot easier

Mar 15 10:07:01 <[twisti]>	in vscode, i can set breakpoints to only trigger after other break points. is there a way to make those other breakpoints 'not trigger' ? my problem is like 7 breakpoints deep, and i only want it to STOP at the lowest one, but if i disable the ones the lowest one depends on it doesnt get triggered
Mar 15 10:31:21 <rawtaz>	arkanoid: back at work :) yeah.. i've found that nowadays virtualenv seems to be "the thing", is that right? i have often thought i should start using it again :D
Mar 15 10:44:59 <arkanoid>	virtualenv is the bare minimum to get a development environment. From there, you evolve into more complex systems. Most people use virtualenv as general starting point for anything python
