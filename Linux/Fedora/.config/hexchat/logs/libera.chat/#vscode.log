Feb 22 09:43:44 <[twisti]>	does vscode not have a view for tasks the way it does for launch configs ?
Feb 22 09:44:49 <[twisti]>	alternatively: i am working on a webpack project, so i always run a task that builds it via webpack-hmr, and then a launch task that launches chrome plus debugger. is there a way to combine the two ? launching chrome needs to wait for webpack to finish running, so its not super trivial
Feb 22 11:39:58 <Ecko>	If there's a warning or an error with an open file, it turns the color yellow or red respectively. How do I disable this?

Mar 02 17:39:38 <delvinj>	Hello. Does VSCode have anything like Sublime's python console, where you can evaluate snippets against the editor itself without having to create an extension?
Mar 02 17:39:38 <delvinj>	For example, I'd like to run `editor.selection.active` and see the result in an output window or replacing the selection.
Mar 02 17:39:39 <delvinj>	Thanks in advance.

Mar 03 08:36:57 <jonnj>	Hi. Does anyone have a clue why "Run without Debugging" is no longer working for me, it looks like the debugger is running but the red square will not stop it. I have to stop it from the menu. This seemed to start happening after the last update. "RUN AND DEBUG" is "Run current file" which is index.js. Thanks in advance for any help.
Mar 03 13:04:21 <rawtaz>	jonnj: sorry i have no idea, never used that stuff. maybe downgrade to the previous version?

Mar 06 15:47:54 <FueraDeServicio>	Hi. I'm trying to avoid having a word highlighted with transparency when I click on it in the editor area. I would like it to only do this when I double-click, regardless of the case.
Mar 06 15:48:06 <FueraDeServicio>	this is an example: https://imgur.com/MybrOZd
Mar 06 15:48:24 <FueraDeServicio>	could somebody help me, please? thanks in advance!
Mar 06 16:16:08 <[twisti]>	FueraDeServicio: there are two colours, one for clicked on, another for selected, so you should be able to change the 'selected' variant to be transparent
Mar 06 16:16:57 <[twisti]>	i think its either editor.selectionBackground or editor.selectionHighlightBackground, maybe play around with those
Mar 06 16:21:54 <FueraDeServicio>	Thanks for your help [twisti]. Actually, I think that disabling editor.occurrencesHighlight is enough for me. Now it only highlights only when I doble-clic on the word, and marks any existing repetition
Mar 06 16:22:25 <FueraDeServicio>	enyway, I will save your idea just in case it's not actually whan I'm looking for
Mar 06 16:22:35 <FueraDeServicio>	thanks enyway for your help :)

Mar 09 22:43:59 <acalbaza>	having trouble getting extensions to install inside my devcontainer when its built. however, i can install them directly. is it supposed to work this way?! 
Mar 09 22:50:16 <rawtaz>	is it supposed to work in what way?
Mar 09 22:50:42 <rawtaz>	if you are asking "am i supposed to be able to install extensions in my devcontainer?" then the answer is yes.
Mar 09 22:50:49 <acalbaza>	having to explicitly install extensions for my devcontainer rather than having them install when it builds
Mar 09 22:51:10 <rawtaz>	i dont do that. i put them in the devcontianer config and they install as they shoudld
Mar 09 22:52:35 <acalbaza>	i have them defined in my devcontainer.json, but they don't install for some reason... ~/.vscode-server/extensions/extensions.json is empty after rebuilding.
Mar 09 22:53:14 <rawtaz>	okay. i guess you did something wrong or there is a bug in vs code or the devcontainer extension then
Mar 09 22:53:26 <rawtaz>	it worked for me last time i used it, thats really all i know at this point in time :)

Mar 10 17:54:05 <jmcgee>	hello
Mar 10 17:54:44 <jmcgee>	2 questions about devcontainers.  is there a way to set devcontainers to have a default devcontainer for all projects? is there a way to set it so all projects automatically open in said devcontainer?
