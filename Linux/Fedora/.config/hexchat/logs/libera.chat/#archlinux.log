Dec 11 18:09:39 <arch-angel>	done
Dec 11 18:09:48 <arch-angel>	nope still not working
Dec 11 18:09:52 <Pikk3wyn>	you may need to restart xorg, tho it may also be needed to add a config to xorg for /dev/input/wacom
Dec 11 18:10:04 <arch-angel>	alright
Dec 11 18:10:10 <Pikk3wyn>	that is in section 5.3.3 Xorg config in the wiki page
Dec 11 18:10:21 <Pikk3wyn>	did you restart xorg first?
Dec 11 18:10:24 <Pikk3wyn>	just to check
Dec 11 18:10:51 <Pikk3wyn>	it really should be working tho, xorg was picking it up
Dec 11 18:10:58 <arch-angel>	nope
Dec 11 18:11:02 <arch-angel>	still not working
Dec 11 18:11:10 <arch-angel>	ls /dev/input/wacom* gives me no matches found: /dev/input/wacom*
Dec 11 18:11:49 <arch-angel>	https://termbin.com/g5xb
Dec 11 18:11:53 <arch-angel>	here's my Xorg.0.log
Dec 11 18:13:08 <Pikk3wyn>	you may need to replug the tablet aswell
Dec 11 18:13:31 <arch-angel>	xinput --list does not show my tablet
Dec 11 18:13:43 <arch-angel>	aaand I have also replugged it too
Dec 11 18:14:04 <Pikk3wyn>	unfortunately at this point I am not sure

Dec 11 18:14:45 <arch-angel>	damn
Dec 11 18:14:51 <MacGyver>	KillerWasp: Great to hear you succeeded!
Dec 11 18:14:51 <Exa>	Hello, I just installed a PCI card with wi-fi and bluetooth but I don't need the wi-fi part, I'm wondering if there is something that can be disabled so that it doesn't look for networks needlessly.  I only have dhdpcd and systemd-networkd enabled that could trigger this, or maybe I could blacklist iwlwifi (the module that is loaded).  Note that I don't want to disable the bluetooth part, but I would not be surprised if it works as a pair.  Thanks.
Dec 11 18:15:01 <Pikk3wyn>	arch-angel: try downgrade xf86-input-wacom
Dec 11 18:15:17 <arch-angel>	xf86-input-wacom did not get upgraded since like april I think
Dec 11 18:15:30 <arch-angel>	I downgraded libwacom too
Dec 11 18:15:33 <arch-angel>	didn't work either
Dec 11 18:16:40 <Pikk3wyn>	hmm
Dec 11 18:16:54 <MacGyver>	Exa: `rfkill` will list the options, then `rfkill block wlan` or somesuch, and hope that bluetooth keeps working with the wlan soft-blocked.
Dec 11 18:17:22 <arch-angel>	I going to sleep rn, please do update me if you find any potential solutions
Dec 11 18:17:24 <arch-angel>	thanks!
Dec 11 18:17:38 <Pikk3wyn>	it wouldn't hurt to install the git version of the wacom module I guess
Dec 11 18:18:14 <Pikk3wyn>	downgrading the kernel would fix it, if that is the problem
Dec 11 18:18:25 <Exa>	MacGyver: can it be done at boot (I mean I can write a systemd unit for that but there could be a better way)?
Dec 11 18:18:44 <MacGyver>	Exa: The default configuration we ship remembers rfkill state, I think.
Dec 11 18:19:42 <MacGyver>	Exa: I might be wrong -- see whether you see log messages for "Starting Load/Save RF Kill Switch Status..." in the journal when you execute rfkill.
Dec 11 18:20:32 <MacGyver>	Exa: If you want to configure it for a device you provision, i.e. it has to happen at *first* boot, I can look up how exactly that works again but it sounds like that's not the issue.
Dec 11 18:20:35 <Exa>	MacGyver: I have the systemd-rfkill unit already started (before running anything)
Dec 11 18:20:50 <Exa>	hmm, it's a static unit
Dec 11 18:21:11 <MacGyver>	Exa: Yes but that doesn't mean it actually *blocks*, it just applies rfkill state.
Dec 11 18:21:18 <MacGyver>	Exa: By default that's unblocked.
Dec 11 18:21:24 <Pikk3wyn>	it does remember in the default config
Dec 11 18:21:28 <MacGyver>	Exa: You actually have to make a change.
Dec 11 18:21:43 <Pikk3wyn>	Exa: it should show in the log of systemctl status systemd-rfkill.service
Dec 11 18:21:54 <Pikk3wyn>	whether it saved/loaded the state
Dec 11 18:22:00 <Exa>	MacGyver: it did start something when I have run the rfkill command
Dec 11 18:22:26 <MacGyver>	Exa: Then it's supposed to have saved rfkill state and will (attempt to) apply that at next boot.
Dec 11 18:23:01 <MacGyver>	Exa: If you now run `rfkill` without argument you'll see wlan listed as "blocked" under SOFT.
Dec 11 18:23:48 <Exa>	it saved something in /var/lib/systemd/rfkill (checked the manual).  I'm going to reboot to check if bluetooth is still there
Dec 11 18:24:26 <Pikk3wyn>	if the bluetooth stops working it should stop working now 
Dec 11 18:25:04 <Pikk3wyn>	thought it's not impossible that the hardware could be a little strange ;)
Dec 11 18:25:56 <Pikk3wyn>	bluetooth/wifi combo cards can be a bit weird 
Dec 11 18:26:44 <Exa>	it kept the config, thanks
Dec 11 18:26:50 <Exa>	and bluetooth still works
Dec 11 18:27:28 <Exa>	it's not set to be "hard blocked" so it's possible that this didn't change anything
Dec 11 18:28:52 <rapha>	Hi all! In my xrandr output, there is a 3rd screen (besides builtin and HDMI) called "None-2-1" ... what could that be caused by, and can i get rid of it? (this is an Nvidia Optimus laptop with Optimus disabled in the BIOS ... could it be related to that?)
Dec 11 18:31:23 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: it's probably related, and it's unlikely you can get rid of it
Dec 11 18:31:35 <nathan>	I assume it's disconnected? My laptop shows disconnected "screens" in xrandr that could be connected via usb-c
Dec 11 18:32:42 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: you shouldn't try to get rid of it
Dec 11 18:36:54 <Pikk3wyn>	does it only appear with optimus disabled?
Dec 11 18:37:19 <MacGyver>	Exa: "Hard blocked" is usually only set when the device is disabled at UEFI level or has some kind of in-hardware kill switch.
Dec 11 18:37:51 <MacGyver>	Exa: Soft blocked usually works fine.
Dec 11 18:43:10 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: if it only appears with optimus disabled, it would be some vestige of the igpu
Dec 11 18:43:13 <Pikk3wyn>	if the laptop has a mux
Dec 11 19:05:00 <fenugrec>	mpan , MacGyver , a power failure precipitated my full-poweroff-test, and... SATA0 port now works. Interesting that yesterday's regular shutdown (i.e. without physically unplugging the PSU) wasn't enough
Dec 11 19:05:33 <MacGyver>	fenugrec: That is intensely weird.
Dec 11 19:05:49 <MacGyver>	fenugrec: I wouldn't usually expect some firmware issue to only affect *one* SATA port.
Dec 11 19:05:58 <fenugrec>	I know right
Dec 11 19:06:03 <MacGyver>	But I guess good that you got it fixed :')
Dec 11 19:06:14 <fenugrec>	I hate this kind of anectodal, inexplicable 'fix'
Dec 11 19:06:28 <fenugrec>	"have you tried disconnecting from the wall for 12 hours", wtf
Dec 11 19:07:54 <mpan>	I find it weird too, but good that you no longer experience issues
Dec 11 19:08:18 <MacGyver>	fenugrec: Oh!
Dec 11 19:08:33 <MacGyver>	fenugrec: Did you, at any point, disconnect the drive's *power* cable?
Dec 11 19:08:41 <MacGyver>	No wait.
Dec 11 19:08:46 <MacGyver>	You tested the drive on another sata port.
Dec 11 19:08:48 <fenugrec>	yes, a few times early in the process
Dec 11 19:08:59 <MacGyver>	Even if you hadn't, that wouldn't be it.
Dec 11 19:08:59 <fenugrec>	specifically to rule out a flaky power conn
Dec 11 19:09:21 <MacGyver>	I was thinking "drive firmware crash could've survived SATA cable unplug".
Dec 11 19:09:49 <fenugrec>	(or a buggy SSD firmware, which may maintain some state through a data cable re-seat)
Dec 11 19:10:11 <fenugrec>	but yeah, this is all conjecture. Piece of garbage works for now, hopefully lasts another 4-5 years
Dec 11 19:10:43 <rapha>	Pikk3wyn: no idea what a mux is. i disabled optimus in order to get the sound card working, and i do have sound output now ... still no working microphone though. the reason i was asking about the "None" display is that, once i plug in the HDMI screen and close the lid, it does switch off the internal, but now the desktop becomes a double-width virtual desktop, which is annoying.
Dec 11 19:11:21 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: closing the laptop wouldnt turn off the screen in xrandr
Dec 11 19:11:31 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: you can use xrandr --off eDP-1 
Dec 11 19:11:37 <Pikk3wyn>	or whatever the internal display is
Dec 11 19:11:40 <rapha>	it happens automatically, Pikk3wyn 
Dec 11 19:11:45 <rapha>	so that part works fine
Dec 11 19:12:24 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: can you give xrandr output when the issue is ocurring and the screen is closed?
Dec 11 19:12:25 <rapha>	for some reason though, the desktop ends up being 5120x1440px
Dec 11 19:12:28 <Pikk3wyn>	possibly it does not reset the pos
Dec 11 19:12:30 <rapha>	yes, Pikk3wyn 
Dec 11 19:13:09 <rapha>	this is what it looks like: https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/a1c1a4d7e60e2b2adeb8b83b530f658a
Dec 11 19:13:38 <rapha>	interestingly, Cinnamon's Display setting knows nothing about the 5120x1440
Dec 11 19:14:34 <Pikk3wyn>	try xrandr --auto after closing the screen
Dec 11 19:16:30 <rapha>	screen goes blank and then it comes back like it was and xrandr complains "X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)" 
Dec 11 19:17:05 <Pikk3wyn>	and using --off before closing?
Dec 11 19:17:53 <Pikk3wyn>	also try xrandr --fb correctxdimensions
Dec 11 19:18:25 <rapha>	xrandr: failed to parse 'correctxdimensions' as a framebuffer size
Dec 11 19:18:30 <rapha>	let me try the off thing
Dec 11 19:18:33 <Pikk3wyn>	it needs to be the res
Dec 11 19:18:36 <rapha>	oooh
Dec 11 19:18:39 <Pikk3wyn>	:)
Dec 11 19:19:23 <rapha>	xrandr: specified screen 2560x1440 not large enough for output HDMI-0 (2560x1440+40+0) o_O
Dec 11 19:19:36 <Pikk3wyn>	make it 2600x1440
Dec 11 19:19:45 <Pikk3wyn>	it says it's got 40px of offset
Dec 11 19:19:51 <rapha>	yeah, weird
Dec 11 19:19:53 <rapha>	OH!
Dec 11 19:19:59 <rapha>	the mouse vanishes on the left side of the screen
Dec 11 19:20:02 <Pikk3wyn>	you can either use 2600, or you can try xrandr --output HDMI-0 --pos 0x0
Dec 11 19:20:03 <rapha>	i have a mouse-eating monster!
Dec 11 19:20:19 <rapha>	nah, 2600 is BadMatch, it doesn't like that
Dec 11 19:20:33 <Pikk3wyn>	try do --pos 0x0
Dec 11 19:20:40 <rapha>	that helped. mouse saved.
Dec 11 19:20:54 <rapha>	--fb is still BadMatch
Dec 11 19:21:06 <rapha>	so let's try the manual --off
Dec 11 19:21:51 <rapha>	xrandr --output DP-0 --off => screens go dark, come back, "BadMatch"
Dec 11 19:22:04 <lairnc>	is it normal that wheels group hasnt been automatically created?
Dec 11 19:22:31 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: is the display closed at this point?
Dec 11 19:22:41 <rapha>	no, i kept it open to not interfere
Dec 11 19:22:45 <espresso>	lairnc: many distros use it while I gather that others don't. arch?
Dec 11 19:22:46 <rapha>	now i closed it again tho
Dec 11 19:23:01 <lairnc>	oh it is already there
Dec 11 19:23:04 <lairnc>	sorry, my bad
Dec 11 19:23:07 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: has it always had this issue?
Dec 11 19:23:51 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: are there more than 1 providers in xrandr --listproviders?
Dec 11 19:24:22 <rapha>	Pikk3wyn: it's a new laptop, well, new to me and freshly installed. so yes, it's had it since i first tried attaching an external screen (which was yesterday).
Dec 11 19:24:52 <rapha>	here's the providers: https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/b80da448dae38e6b15071f185a788f8d
Dec 11 19:25:51 <Pikk3wyn>	ah, nvidia strangeness
Dec 11 19:26:03 <rapha>	oh.
Dec 11 19:26:11 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: it's a bit of a long shot, but first try xrandr --output internalwhatever --same-as HDMI
Dec 11 19:26:15 <rapha>	funny enough i don't even need a gaming GPU.
Dec 11 19:26:44 <Pikk3wyn>	have you tried without optimus disabled?
Dec 11 19:26:51 <rapha>	that's BadMatch again
Dec 11 19:28:03 <KillerWasp>	hello. exist a way for identify all the fonts in a old system?
Dec 11 19:28:04 <rapha>	no, Optimus was already disabled when i first connected an external screen. but i need sound, and under Linux there's some nvidia strangeness going on where Optimus overwrites the sound card's address space. it's exceedingly spooky. under Windows, all is well, but i don't want to use that and certainly can't do my work there.
Dec 11 19:28:19 <rapha>	but for the sake of debugging i'll enable Optimus again, Pikk3wyn 
Dec 11 19:28:49 <KillerWasp>	fonts in packages*
Dec 11 19:29:48 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: it's possible that you can fix it by blacklisting/unloading snd_hda_codec_hdmi
Dec 11 19:29:54 <Edu4rdSHL>	fc-list, KillerWasp 
Dec 11 19:30:12 <Pikk3wyn>	not sure if there is an nvidia.audio param
Dec 11 19:30:15 <KillerWasp>	i try with 'pacman -Qqn' and get the list, but still i can't find all the packages of fonts in the list, except for ttf-* and noto-font-*
Dec 11 19:30:16 <espresso>	KillerWasp: perhaps  fc-list ? https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fonts#Tips_and_tricks
Dec 11 19:30:17 <phrik>	Title: Fonts - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Dec 11 19:30:32 <Pikk3wyn>	do you know if the memory issue is on a hardware level?
Dec 11 19:31:24 <espresso>	KillerWasp: but yes, that is not packages..
Dec 11 19:31:49 <Pikk3wyn>	you can test by having optimus on but do a temporary edit in grub with modprobe.blacklist=nvidia 
Dec 11 19:32:32 <Pikk3wyn>	are there any details as to the address space?
Dec 11 19:34:36 <teraflops>	KillerWasp: pacman -F $(fc-list |awk 'BEGIN{FS=":"} {print $1}')
Dec 11 19:36:38 <rapha>	will try these two together, thank you Pikk3wyn! will be Friday evening until i can do a reboot though... - re the memory issue, i'm not even certain about whether that's accurate. it was just info from a forum post which now i can't find anymore :/
Dec 11 19:36:45 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: not being able to turn off the output sounds like the hardware being difficult, tho it's possible you could mess around with xrandr --setprovideroffloadsink or --setprovideroutputsource, perhaps it will decide to work with a certain configuration
Dec 11 19:37:06 <Pikk3wyn>	what exactly I am not sure, since with optimus disabled I don't know why there are 3 providers
Dec 11 19:37:15 <rapha>	it is strange.
Dec 11 19:37:27 <espresso>	KillerWasp: and of course pacman -Qs font may show some other
Dec 11 19:37:32 <rapha>	ok, friday evening => re-enable optimus and look into how that behaves then.
Dec 11 19:38:14 <Pikk3wyn>	rapha: what DE out of interest?
Dec 11 19:38:28 <rapha>	Cinnamon, Pikk3wyn 
Dec 11 19:38:38 <rapha>	(which i hope will soon move to Wayland)
Dec 11 19:39:00 <Pikk3wyn>	which is on the left
Dec 11 19:39:04 <Pikk3wyn>	is it the internal?
Dec 11 19:39:36 <rapha>	no, that's the external on the left
Dec 11 19:40:00 <rapha>	marked "primary", whether it's the only one or the internal one is on as well
Dec 11 19:41:08 <rapha>	funny enough, with the lid open, the size is "Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 5121 x 1440, maximum 32767 x 32767"
Dec 11 19:41:52 <rapha>	oh, wait, that was my own fault
Dec 11 19:41:59 <rapha>	messing with --pos
Dec 11 19:42:10 <rapha>	now it's 5120 as it should be
Dec 11 19:42:44 <rapha>	but even though the right screen is at 2560x1440+2560+0, the mouse cursor vanishes to the right of it
Dec 11 19:44:48 <Pikk3wyn>	quite strange
Dec 11 19:45:14 <MacGyver>	rapha: Could you pastebin your current layout again?
Dec 11 19:45:53 <Pikk3wyn>	they are both set to 2560x1440, they both have the correct offset, and the framebuffer is the correct size?
Dec 11 19:46:05 <rapha>	MacGyver: with the lid open? that's https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/da9025238c98e3d711770396b39de99e
Dec 11 19:46:09 <teraflops>	KillerWasp: even better LANG=C pacman -F $(fc-list |awk 'BEGIN{FS=":"} {print $1}') | awk '{print $5}' | awk '!seen[$0] {print}
Dec 11 19:46:10 <teraflops>	     {++seen
Dec 11 19:46:29 <rapha>	Pikk3wyn: how do i see the framebuffer size? it does not seem to be part of the `xrandr` output.
Dec 11 19:46:31 <teraflops>	sorryy  {++seen[$0]}'
Dec 11 19:46:46 <Pikk3wyn>	the framebuffer size is the current under Screen 0
Dec 11 19:47:05 <Pikk3wyn>	well, next to it :)
Dec 11 19:47:28 <rapha>	ah ok
Dec 11 19:47:46 <rapha>	so yeah, both 2460x1440 is correct and hence 5120x1440 is also correct
Dec 11 19:48:25 <Pikk3wyn>	is it a TV or a regular screen?
Dec 11 19:48:27 <rapha>	the mouse only just-so vanishes, too ... 1.5x the mouse cursor width perhaps; not more than that
Dec 11 19:48:47 <rapha>	it's a regular screen, an Asus PB278QV
Dec 11 19:48:50 <MacGyver>	That sounds like Pikk3wyn is onto something.
Dec 11 19:49:00 <MacGyver>	You may have some kind of edge cropping enabled somewhere.
Dec 11 19:49:06 <Pikk3wyn>	there was that offset of +40 that was set automatically before
Dec 11 19:49:35 <rapha>	Cinnamon doesn't have any edge cropping to my knowledge ... can't see anything like that in the Display settings
Dec 11 19:49:39 <MacGyver>	No, it's a screen thing.
Dec 11 19:49:42 <rapha>	oh
Dec 11 19:49:46 <MacGyver>	I forget what it's called.
Dec 11 19:50:03 <rapha>	but to the right side, that's the _internal_ display
Dec 11 19:50:24 <rapha>	let me re-arrange them, internal to the left
Dec 11 19:50:58 <rapha>	works like it should.
Dec 11 19:51:05 <rapha>	... and back ...
Dec 11 19:51:29 <rapha>	vanishing mouse on the very right edge. so it's reproducible. funky.
Dec 11 19:51:43 <Pikk3wyn>	probably has something to with why it had a pos of +40 by itself previously
Dec 11 19:52:05 <rapha>	i guess so, although the mouse hiding corner seems <40px
Dec 11 19:52:18 <MacGyver>	rapha: Do you also see the mouse twice on the left edge?
Dec 11 19:52:39 <rapha>	no, MacGyver, it's not drunk, it swears!!
Dec 11 19:53:01 <MacGyver>	rapha: See what happens if you select the 165 refresh mode.
Dec 11 19:53:07 <rapha>	huh
Dec 11 19:53:13 <rapha>	oh, right
Dec 11 19:53:15 <MacGyver>	--rate 165
Dec 11 19:53:41 <rapha>	nothing happened
Dec 11 19:53:45 <rapha>	and Cinnamon doesn't know about it
Dec 11 19:54:00 <MacGyver>	Full commandline you're trying?
Dec 11 19:54:10 <rapha>	as far as i can tell it's still at 60Hz ... xrandr --output DP-0 --rate 165
Dec 11 19:54:13 <Pikk3wyn>	it's very strange that you can't disable the internal one
Dec 11 19:54:22 <rapha>	and that there's 3, not 2
Dec 11 19:54:23 <MacGyver>	Yeah you probably need to be more explicit there.
Dec 11 19:54:35 <MacGyver>	Give me a second to craft this.
Dec 11 19:54:58 <rapha>	more explicit? want me to show it pictures of Billie Eilish?
Dec 11 19:56:11 <MacGyver>	rapha: xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 2560x1440 --rate 74.60 --pos 0x0 --primary --output DP-0 --mode 2560x1440 --rate 165 --pos 2560x0 --output None-2-1 --off
Dec 11 19:56:52 <MacGyver>	rapha: Don't make it deduce stuff from current layout, just explicitly configure all modes in one go, see how that fares.
Dec 11 19:57:04 <rapha>	oh, wow, that's very explicit
Dec 11 19:57:06 <Pikk3wyn>	strange it is giving 59.95
Dec 11 19:57:14 <Pikk3wyn>	that's a TV mode I think
Dec 11 19:57:32 <rapha>	also 74.94 for the external one, not 75 like it actually is
Dec 11 19:57:42 <MacGyver>	It probably *actually* is 74.94.
Dec 11 19:57:51 <MacGyver>	Marketed as 75 because close enough.
Dec 11 19:57:58 <rapha>	oh, wait
Dec 11 19:58:01 <rapha>	marked 74.60
Dec 11 19:58:14 <MacGyver>	Okay, same diff.
Dec 11 19:58:14 <rapha>	in native rez, anyways
Dec 11 19:58:23 <rapha>	mared 75.00 in the lower resolutions
Dec 11 19:58:50 <Pikk3wyn>	I would think so, the 59.95 is a bit odd for it to advertise tho
Dec 11 19:58:51 <MacGyver>	It's not unusual to be up to .5 away from a round number.
Dec 11 19:59:13 <rapha>	hmm, it seems that command changed nothing
Dec 11 19:59:21 <Pikk3wyn>	ja, it's never (usually) a round 60, but the .5 would be off in the modeline
Dec 11 19:59:27 <rapha>	https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/da9025238c98e3d711770396b39de99e/revisions
Dec 11 19:59:35 <rapha>	so it did, a little
Dec 11 19:59:39 <Pikk3wyn>	(as far as i remember anyway)
Dec 11 19:59:44 <MacGyver>	rapha: Yeah, that actually shows the right modes selected now.
Dec 11 19:59:45 <rapha>	oh, the little asterisk seems to indicate "active"
Dec 11 20:00:05 <MacGyver>	rapha: And it *also* shows that the physical geometry slightly changed.
Dec 11 20:00:13 <rapha>	that's weird, isn't it?
Dec 11 20:00:15 <MacGyver>	rapha: So, how's that mouse looking?
Dec 11 20:00:24 <MacGyver>	Oh yeah, absolutely.
Dec 11 20:00:30 <rapha>	mouse still has its nice little hiding spot on the far right
Dec 11 20:00:35 <rapha>	perhaps it's a Republican mouse
Dec 11 20:00:36 <MacGyver>	Darn.
Dec 11 20:00:48 <rapha>	but hey, i'm learning things here :)
Dec 11 20:01:14 <Pikk3wyn>	the 59.95 is possibly misreported 59.946, or just off by .01 for whatever reason
Dec 11 20:01:20 <Pikk3wyn>	that's ntsc tv rate
Dec 11 20:01:35 <MacGyver>	Pikk3wyn: I think you're attributing too much logic to it.
Dec 11 20:01:42 <MacGyver>	Pikk3wyn: I have a projector that has 59.81.
Dec 11 20:01:45 <rapha>	and when i do --output DP-0 --off, i still get the 5120px wide framebuffer, MacGyver 
Dec 11 20:01:48 <MacGyver>	And a screen that has 59.88
Dec 11 20:01:59 <Pikk3wyn>	haha probably
Dec 11 20:01:59 <MacGyver>	It's not necessarily NTSC rates.
Dec 11 20:02:08 <MacGyver>	rapha: Hrrm.
Dec 11 20:02:08 <rapha>	(and i'm in Europe, we got PAL)
Dec 11 20:02:21 <MacGyver>	rapha: So am I, it's still not a nice round number :P
Dec 11 20:02:41 <MacGyver>	The physics behind that is very interesting, weird, and for now, irrelevant and off-topic :P
Dec 11 20:02:59 <MacGyver>	Anyway.
Dec 11 20:03:06 <MacGyver>	Since the framebuffer stays the same size.
Dec 11 20:03:08 <rapha>	we can get into analog video of you like, i fly FPV quads :P
Dec 11 20:03:30 <MacGyver>	I wonder whether you should try explicitly configuring the Screen 0 geometry.
Dec 11 20:04:05 <rapha>	with --screen?
Dec 11 20:04:26 <rapha>	oh. wrong syntax.
Dec 11 20:04:29 <MacGyver>	Yeah. I've never had to do this myself so I don't know the exact incantation you'll need.
Dec 11 20:04:53 <Pikk3wyn>	that's just with --fb 
Dec 11 20:04:56 <rapha>	--screen 0 --fb 2560x1440, but that's "BadMatch"
Dec 11 20:05:03 <MacGyver>	Oh it may actually be --display, not --screen
Dec 11 20:05:35 <Pikk3wyn>	did you try without --screen?
Dec 11 20:05:44 <rapha>	BadRequest
Dec 11 20:06:08 <rapha>	i should make a rap song where the background chorus always goes "bad request"

Dec 17 12:36:20 <randomxusr>	got it. sorry it took me a moment to get back.  Let's I build a kernel from the LTS source. I end up with a bzImage. Would I then create the initramfs?
Dec 17 12:37:39 <Namarrgon>	yes
Dec 17 12:38:49 <randomxusr>	Could I accomplish this part by returning to the Wiki and follow the arch process?  I'm a bit nervous, and wondering where to find the best reference material
Dec 17 12:40:33 <Namarrgon>	you could use mkinitcpio to build one
Dec 17 12:41:32 <randomxusr>	thanks. I'll hit up the wiki and man pages.  I had made a kernel earlier, and it failed. I'm thinking this is why, and I didn't make the ramdisk
Dec 17 12:42:11 <ponies>	nope it's something else 
Dec 17 12:42:25 <Namarrgon>	"failed"?
Dec 17 12:43:37 <randomxusr>	Something about not being able to load the filesystem. I don't recall the exact error, however, I chave some reading to do, and troubleshooting to figure out what I did wrong
Dec 17 12:44:29 <ponies>	likely you are adding things not included in the vanilla kernel
Dec 17 12:44:35 <randomxusr>	the kernel tried to load and I suspect there was a kernel panic because the caps lock and power lights started blinking and the system wouldn't load
Dec 17 12:45:31 <randomxusr>	ponies, more than likely. I did stay away from any features that looked experimental or had the word "Dangerous" in the menuconfig
Dec 17 12:46:32 <Warepire>	When I started out doing my own kernel stuff I found a lot of great help at https://kernelnewbies.org/ and their IRC channel.
Dec 17 12:46:34 <phrik>	Title: Linux_Kernel_Newbies - Linux Kernel Newbies (at kernelnewbies.org)
Dec 17 12:47:08 <randomxusr>	Warepire, thank you. I will check that out
Dec 17 12:49:56 <Namarrgon>	if the OS is on a "plain" filesystem the perhaps building the drivers directly into the kernel would be simpler to get started
Dec 17 12:50:53 <Namarrgon>	an initrd adds a second layer of complexity, during the build and during runtime
Dec 17 12:51:58 <randomxusr>	I thought I had the drivers covered by choosing those available from menuconfig. I don't feel my understanding is great regarding module loading
Dec 17 12:52:30 <Ingar>	the kernel needs to load modules from the root filesystem, but for that it needs all the drivers to read the root filesystem in the first place
Dec 17 12:52:52 <Namarrgon>	if you already have a working arch kernel then you can look at the modules included with its initramfs, to get an idea what you cannot leave out
Dec 17 12:53:19 <randomxusr>	ooh good idea Namarrgon 
Dec 17 12:53:33 <MrElendig>	randomxusr: also modprobedb
Dec 17 12:54:22 <randomxusr>	I've been on my current system for almost two years, and haven't wanted to mess with the stability. Ergo, that test VM/USB
Dec 17 12:55:22 <randomxusr>	MrElendig, thanks
Dec 17 12:55:54 <ponies>	you should rather use vagrant instead of the usb 
Dec 17 12:56:12 <MrElendig>	or just a disk image
Dec 17 12:56:57 <randomxusr>	fair enough. I may do just that. I just figured since I had the USB, it's convient to take with
Dec 17 12:59:07 <lowden>	reading from archwiki https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/System_configuration#mkinitcpio in the table it says systemd and busybox does that i mean i can use encrypt or sd-encrypt and it won't matter ?
Dec 17 12:59:08 <phrik>	Title: dm-crypt/System configuration - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Dec 17 12:59:51 <Namarrgon>	if you use the systemd hook then you need to use the sd-* versions of the rest of the hooks
Dec 17 13:00:21 <lowden>	because i am trying to do https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-cryptenroll#Trusted_Platform_Module it says it requires systemd and sd-encrypt hooks
Dec 17 13:00:22 <phrik>	Title: systemd-cryptenroll - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Dec 17 13:01:40 <lowden>	will it break my current config with encrypt if i switch everything ti system and sd-*
Dec 17 13:01:50 <lowden>	s/ti/to
Dec 17 13:01:55 <lowden>	s/system/systemd
Dec 17 13:02:52 <Namarrgon>	yes, the hooks need different kernel parameters
Dec 17 13:43:56 <liminal>	Hey, I would love a point in the right direction if someone knows. Im running i3 and created a python script that I want to run in the background but send commands to. How would I approach this?
Dec 17 13:46:22 <gromit>	liminal: why does it need to run permanently and what is it for? 
Dec 17 13:47:20 <liminal>	just a silly project, I guess i can just make it write a file
Dec 17 13:47:25 <seawead>	maybe using sockets or signals?
Dec 17 13:47:48 <liminal>	ill look into that thanks seawead
Dec 17 13:47:58 <liminal>	and thanks gromit
Dec 17 13:48:09 <sheep>	a fifo (named pipe) might also work
Dec 17 13:48:31 <liminal>	ah thats an idea
Dec 17 13:49:14 <liminal>	thanks i think have enough to do some research and test things out
Dec 17 13:51:25 <gromit>	liminal: you could have a deamon and something that sends it commands
Dec 17 13:51:35 <gromit>	liminal: again, whats the usecase? 
Dec 17 14:05:21 <liminal>	gromit: I was just messing around with chatgpt api, I wanted something that runs in the background and responds to certain tasks
Dec 17 14:05:47 <gromit>	liminal: oof, alright good luck 
Dec 17 14:06:34 <liminal>	yeah, its a silly project
Dec 17 14:07:12 <liminal>	haha, i got TTS and STT working, just seeing what else I can do
Dec 17 14:08:16 <liminal>	I also never did python before, so its kind of a fun way to learn that. Im more of a c/c++ guy

janv. 18 11:11:52 <rs2009>	copying my question from yesterday:
janv. 18 11:11:53 <rs2009>	hey y'all, I've been trying to get any desktop environment (tried GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE) running without flickering on a 13900H with an Iris Xe, without any luck; I've tried several boot parameters (i915.enable_psr=0, i915.enable_fbc=0, intel_idle.max_cstate=4), but there still appears to be a grid of flickering "boxes" on Wayland, and just one
janv. 18 11:11:54 <rs2009>	such "box" each in the upper and bottom halves of the screen on X11 with each of the desktop environments I've tried (except XFCE ofc, it doesn't support Wayland)
janv. 18 11:12:14 <rs2009>	does anyone have an idea why this might be happening?
janv. 18 11:12:32 <rs2009>	s/an/any/g
janv. 18 11:56:25 <Erus_Iluvatar>	rs2009: nothing notable in the logs? 
janv. 18 11:56:33 <Erus_Iluvatar>	!paste
janv. 18 11:56:34 <phrik>	Paste short snippets (up to 3 lines) in channel. Please do NOT use pastebin.com or paste.ubuntu.com -- some good, sane paste services are http://ix.io, https://paste.rs, https://bpaste.net and https://gist.github.com. See !ix or !rs for an easy way to paste from a pipe.
janv. 18 12:01:16 <rs2009>	Erus_Iluvatar: nah, I had a look at dmesg and even journalctl, but there's nothing much of interest (i915 initialization aside that is)
janv. 18 12:02:41 <rs2009>	disabling modesetting (passing `nomodeset`) eliminates the flickering entirely, so it seems like it does have something to do with i915
janv. 18 12:05:09 <rs2009>	I installed Ubuntu again (22.04 & 23.10) with the linux-oem kernel just to see if it happened there and it does, so it isn't specific to Arch either; I'm installing Arch again, does anyone have any idea about this?
janv. 18 12:05:13 <Erus_Iluvatar>	rs2009: just to make sure, you don't have xf86-video-intel installed, right? 
janv. 18 12:08:57 <rs2009>	Erus_Iluvatar: yep, I explicitly removed it; same on Ubuntu, I removed 'xserver-xorg-video-intel' (Ubuntu's equivalent package), and this flickering happens there too
janv. 18 12:29:00 <Furai>	https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/python-pydot/ are packages like this packaged manually like everything else?

janv. 18 12:29:48 <gromit>	Furai: yes they are, why are you asking? 
janv. 18 12:31:42 <Furai>	I needed some python package version, latest one, that is not in the repo (not specifically the linked one). I guess I'll just use virtualenv if possible in my use-case.

janv. 18 12:34:44 <Furai>	Like I said, it's not that specific package I've linked. And I'm sure I'm better off using pip and virtualenv if possible, just don't know if in my case VS Code plugin will pick it up.
janv. 18 12:35:20 <gromit>	Furai: which is the package in question? But sure, you can use whatever suits you
janv. 18 12:35:48 <Furai>	cfn-lint 
janv. 18 12:37:33 <astralc>	it is executable? you can use pipx
janv. 18 12:41:17 <Namarrgon>	the_d0ct0r: have you tried without vers=3 or with vers=4?
janv. 18 12:41:34 <Namarrgon>	"mount.nfs: requested NFS version or transport protocol is not supported for /mnt/nfs/2TB"
janv. 18 12:44:29 <Furai>	astralc: it's dependency for vscode plugin. No idea how it calls it behind scenes. But I found out how to make vscode use venv instead of globally installed packages. So that's way better solution for me. One day I'll switch to nvim, one day. I keep promising it to myself...and then go to sleep in bed of lies.

janv. 18 12:55:06 <the_d0ct0r>	I used to have it mount v4 but I've mounted both v3 and v4, but I do not know the exact version that's running.  I am using the same exact config I had when i know it was v4.  ChatGPT even gave up on me and said to talk to an NFS expert.  Prior to ChatGPT, I remember following the wiki well.   I could have missed something.

janv. 18 12:58:47 <the_d0ct0r>	the root dir.. well my nfs.conf has that set to /srv/nfs at the moment.

Feb 20 15:08:00 <FreeFull>	So, is there a better way to do -git packages?
Feb 20 15:08:37 <NetSysFire>	for the future: theres also #archlinux-aur
Feb 20 15:08:42 <Scimmia>	The problem here is that the maintainer didn't upload it with a proper pkgver variable, that's it
Feb 20 15:08:54 <astralc>	what wrong with that? it is new version, so pkgrel should be reset
Feb 20 15:10:26 <FreeFull>	Well, the maintainer changed the PKGBUILD (fixed an install path), incremented the pkgrel, but because the pkgver ended up being the same as the previously-installed package, and pkgrel got reset to 1, it didn't update my installed version
Feb 20 15:10:52 <FreeFull>	Ok, so the fix is to make the pkgver variable match what pkgver() outputs
Feb 20 15:11:50 <Namarrgon>	did it break your aur-helper's logic?
Feb 20 15:12:12 <Scimmia>	FreeFull: yes, although that's not a proper pkgver function, either
Feb 20 15:13:50 <Scimmia>	wait, actually it should be. It shouldn't outputting what you pasted here
Feb 20 15:14:59 <Scimmia>	oh, no, they screwed up the sed

Feb 20 15:17:36 <FreeFull>	Scimmia: Thanks
Feb 20 15:17:59 <Scimmia>	DerpGusta: because you installed them. they became default for locally built packages recently

Feb 20 16:15:57 <Juest>	hey, is gitlab access reserved for packagers or..?
Feb 20 16:17:22 <Antiz>	Juest: It's not, but you have to request an account by sending a mail.
Feb 20 16:17:26 <Juest>	is there a way to recover access to the issue tracker account? asking just in case
Feb 20 16:17:59 <Juest>	ah i see, gitlab access is meant for everyone or primarily packagers and interaction with archlinux developed tools?
Feb 20 16:18:07 <Antiz>	Everyone :)
Feb 20 16:18:31 <Antiz>	It's just that, unfortunately, GitLab is suffering from a lot of spam issue right now. So we had to disable account creation for a moment...
Feb 20 16:18:51 <Juest>	i understand, that's unfortunate
Feb 20 16:18:57 <Antiz>	Hence why you have to send a mail to Arch DevOps that will create the account for you.
Feb 20 16:19:03 <Juest>	quite a while that its disabled it seems
Feb 20 16:19:06 <MrDisguised>	Can I install linux on a chromebook ?
Feb 20 16:19:13 <MrDisguised>	Like arch linux arm ?
Feb 20 16:19:36 <Antiz>	Juest: Yes... But spam issues are still ongoing unfortunately, not much we can do at our level AFAIK
Feb 20 16:19:48 <Juest>	gotcha
Feb 20 16:20:09 <Namarrgon>	MrDisguised: wrong distro, #archlinuxarm is next door
Feb 20 16:20:24 <Namarrgon>	unless your chromebook is x86_64

Feb 20 16:21:42 <MrDisguised>	Juest: thanks a lot :)
Feb 20 16:23:08 <Juest>	while not supported, to what extent do arch wiki pages work for other environments?
Feb 20 16:23:18 <Namarrgon>	sometimes
Feb 20 16:23:45 <Juest>	generally with rolling release distros that dont modify upstream?
Feb 20 16:24:19 <Namarrgon>	yes, since arch tends to ship vanilla software the information often applies to other distro that haven't meddled too much with the software
Feb 20 16:24:41 <Juest>	thanks!
Feb 20 16:24:57 <Namarrgon>	but there is a lot of arch-specific stuff in there too, mostly around the boot process
Feb 20 16:25:29 <Juest>	i see
Feb 20 16:25:35 <Juest>	when was openrc used/ditched?
Feb 20 16:25:42 <Juest>	or offered
Feb 20 16:25:44 <Namarrgon>	arch never used openrc
Feb 20 16:26:00 <Juest>	ah i see, but openrc is available for users, no?
Feb 20 16:26:11 <Foxboron>	Juest: of course not
Feb 20 16:26:14 <Namarrgon>	not officially, you'd have to hack them in yourself
Feb 20 16:26:23 <Namarrgon>	s/them/it/
Feb 20 16:26:39 <Juest>	ah, well there's a openrc wiki page
Feb 20 16:27:24 <Scimmia>	It's your system, you can do whatever you want with it. Switching to OpenRC is possible, but not easy or officially supported
Feb 20 16:27:46 <Namarrgon>	you're better off with a different distro if you need openrc
Feb 20 16:28:05 <Juest>	i see, is that why the wiki does not provide further detailed instructions on the installation of it?
Feb 20 16:28:51 <port19>	I suggest you look into Artix, an Arch Linux derivative offering a selection of non-systemd init systems, but otherwise staying close to upstream
Feb 20 16:29:23 <Foxboron>	Artix is trash.
Feb 20 16:29:34 <Foxboron>	Go use Gentoo or Alpine, something that actually supports this
Feb 20 16:30:04 <Juest>	how is artix trash?
Feb 20 16:30:12 <Juest>	it supports multiple init systems
Feb 20 16:30:19 <Foxboron>	How do you think they do that?
Feb 20 16:30:41 <Juest>	providing packages for them and official support for configuring those and isos
Feb 20 16:30:55 <Foxboron>	You can't support 3-4 inits with a dev group that consists of less than 10 people
Feb 20 16:31:08 <Foxboron>	They pull all service files from other distros, like Void, Gentoo and Alpine.
Feb 20 16:31:12 <port19>	As far as I can tell they patch existing arch packages that provide systemd services
Feb 20 16:31:24 <Juest>	correct
Feb 20 16:31:32 <Foxboron>	It's a frankenstein distro, they pull PKGBUILDs from Arch and then add service files from another distro and serve this to users
Feb 20 16:31:36 <Juest>	is that not considered supported?
Feb 20 16:31:36 <Foxboron>	Go use something proper
Feb 20 16:31:49 <Juest>	i understand, thank you
Feb 20 16:31:50 <port19>	Exactly, there is little actual work going on besides building ISOs and maintaining a website
Feb 20 16:32:19 <port19>	I second the suggestion of Foxboron to just use sth proper instead, should you be at all open to that idea 
Feb 20 16:32:37 <Juest>	at least its convenient to users who want the benefits of arch while using a different initd
Feb 20 16:32:50 <Foxboron>	You get none of the benefits. It's not Arch
Feb 20 16:32:56 <port19>	vague compatibility with AUR
Feb 20 16:33:01 <Foxboron>	It's not even binary compatible these days
Feb 20 16:33:08 <Juest>	really?
Feb 20 16:33:34 <Juest>	but it works
Feb 20 16:33:45 <port19>	There is far worse in terms of arch derivatives
Feb 20 16:33:57 <Foxboron>	Then go have fun and rely on their non-existing support when you need it
Feb 20 16:34:00 <Juest>	anyways, thank you for voicing your opinion, i shall hail your opinion
Feb 20 16:34:29 <Juest>	yeah its meant to be an experiment for myself actually
Feb 20 16:34:33 <alad>	they also recompile all kinds of packages just to not have systemd in the dependencies array
Feb 20 16:34:51 <port19>	Arch Linux ARM (alarm for short) is run by two impossible to reach, pretty slow devs. Tons of PRs just sitting ignored in their repos on github, no good communication channels 
Feb 20 16:35:04 <Foxboron>	port19: Lets not

Feb 20 16:54:51 <Harm133>	Hey guys, since one of the latest updates (to I think nvidia-utils) I'm having trouble opening a few applications. Running gnome on wayland with proprietary nvidia drivers. The errors in multiple applications are formatted like "src/gbm_drv_common.c:57: GBM-DRV error (get_bytes_per_component): Unknown or not supported format: 943215175" (with
Feb 20 16:54:52 <Harm133>	different formats). I'm unsure what to look for
Feb 20 16:55:11 <linuxfan>	This is literally the 5th time i am installing arch and never got this error before
Feb 20 16:55:23 <edu4rdshl>	linuxfan, what's the exact error message
Feb 20 16:55:52 <edu4rdshl>	Harm133, have you rebooted since the update?
Feb 20 16:56:01 <Harm133>	edu4rdshl: Yes
Feb 20 16:56:15 <linuxfan>	edu4rdshl grub-install: error: failed to get canonical path of '/boot/efi'
Feb 20 16:56:32 <edu4rdshl>	Pretty sure that's because the latest mesa release
Feb 20 16:56:39 <edu4rdshl>	Harm133 ^
Feb 20 16:56:51 <alad>	jelle: wowow
Feb 20 16:56:59 <edu4rdshl>	The nvidia packages haven't been updated on a few weeks now
Feb 20 16:57:15 <Harm133>	So, downgrading mesa would fix it for now, until nvidia fix their shit?
Feb 20 16:57:23 <edu4rdshl>	Until mesa fix their shit
Feb 20 16:57:25 <edu4rdshl>	:)
Feb 20 16:57:28 <Harm133>	Oh :)
Feb 20 16:57:32 <alad>	:)
Feb 20 16:57:43 <linuxfan>	edu4rdshl i ran the fsck and no errors were reported
Feb 20 16:58:11 <edu4rdshl>	Try downgrading, there's a lot of people having issues with mesa 24 on both nvidia and amd. See https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/10624 as reference

Feb 20 16:58:27 <edu4rdshl>	It isn't only affecting mutter but a lot of other apps
Feb 20 16:58:32 <Namarrgon>	linuxfan: what is mounted to /boot/efi?
Feb 20 16:59:27 <Harm133>	Thx so much edu4rdshl :)
Feb 20 16:59:39 <linuxfan>	Namarrgon the /dev/sda1 partition for EFI which is formatted to fat32
Feb 20 17:00:07 <edu4rdshl>	Harm133, try it and see if that fixes your issue, it may be completely unrelated but since that you said "latest updates" that's the one causing problems that comes to my mind
Feb 20 17:00:31 <Harm133>	I've also looked at MESA so might be a very good guess
Feb 20 17:00:38 <Namarrgon>	linuxfan: the full path to the mountpoint, outside the chroot, is /mnt/boot/efi?
Feb 20 17:02:11 <Harm133>	brb rebooting, looks promising so far
Feb 20 17:06:02 <linuxfan>	Namarrgon lsblk shows two mount points /mnt/boot/efi and /mnt/boot. I have read through the wiki page another github page which was helpful and did not face any issues earlier.
Feb 20 17:06:06 <Harm133>	Well at least my apps open again, however deezer (music client) isn't happy with deep linking it seems
Feb 20 17:06:31 <Namarrgon>	linuxfan: are you running grub-install while in the chroot?
Feb 20 17:07:59 <linuxfan>	No, i have not even installed arch yet. So, outside chroot.
Feb 20 17:08:21 <Namarrgon>	then why are you running grub-install?
Feb 20 17:12:17 <linuxfan>	Sorry, my bad, the instructions of grub is after arch installation. I am just little tired of getting this right, it was all working and only because of browser (all of them) was freezing my system, i was trying to install xfce and then just decided to do a fresh install of arch
Feb 20 17:12:42 <linuxfan>	Thanks for the help 🙂
Feb 20 17:13:13 <Namarrgon>	reinstalling the OS just to switch the DE is a bit overkill
Feb 20 17:15:55 <linuxfan>	Yeah, something went wrong, xfce got installed, but SDDM was not working, i read and tried installing LightDM, it gave errors.
Feb 20 17:16:37 <linuxfan>	Btw, why does it give disk full message when installing package and is it a good/bad idea to clean pacman cashe?
Feb 20 17:18:42 <linuxfan>	If anyone using xfce pls message, i am about to install that in sometime. Hope its good? All i do is use internet mostly and sometimes would edit photographs.
Feb 20 17:20:35 <moldorcoder7>	since recent update , i can not use gnome-keyring on i3 for ssh, the main reason is that gnome-keyring package is enabling a systemd service and socket, i tried to disable them but im getting this message : https://bpa.st/65JQ
Feb 20 17:20:35 <phrik>	Title: View paste 65JQ (at bpa.st)
Feb 20 17:21:03 <moldorcoder7>	any idea how i could fix this ? in my i3 config im starting it with : exec --no-startup-id  /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=gpg,pkcs11,ssh 
Feb 20 17:22:25 <Namarrgon>	linuxfan: which filesystem is full?
Feb 20 17:36:38 <linuxfan>	Namarrgon i am guessing its the root, as the error is when i install a package, but when I check the free space using lsblk, it shows only 4% occupied.
Feb 20 17:36:51 <Namarrgon>	"df -h"
Feb 20 17:37:21 <linuxfan>	Sorry, yeah df -h and not lsblk
Feb 20 17:37:44 <Namarrgon>	post the output
Feb 20 17:37:48 <linuxfan>	Is it bad to clear pacman cache?
Feb 20 17:37:51 <Namarrgon>	no
Feb 20 17:38:28 <linuxfan>	I don't have the error right now, but that's when i decided to do a fresh install
Feb 20 17:38:54 <linuxfan>	Will measure
Feb 20 17:39:08 <linuxfan>	Will message here if i get it again
Feb 20 17:42:12 <linuxfan>	Namarrgon i sort of understand this, can you tell me pls when is should "pacman - Sy" and when "pacman - Syu"
Feb 20 17:43:13 <Erus_Iluvatar>	linuxfan: unless you're having issues with archlinux-keyring, always -Syu
Feb 20 17:43:17 <Namarrgon>	you don't run -Sy. either -Syu or -S
Feb 20 17:43:22 <Erus_Iluvatar>	^
Feb 20 17:44:04 <Namarrgon>	there's exceptions but -Sy is reserved for digging yourself out of a hole
Feb 20 17:44:25 <linuxfan>	Ok
Feb 20 17:44:38 <linuxfan>	Thank you both 🙂
Feb 20 17:47:55 <linuxfan>	Another one, sorry for the question after question, my home partition which is different than the root does not mount after booting, should i add this to the grub file?
Feb 20 17:49:56 <bluetail>	Namarrgon alias digoutofhole='pacman -Sy' sudo digoutofhole 
Feb 20 17:54:25 <Erus_Iluvatar>	oof
Feb 20 17:59:54 <edu4rdshl>	Very bad idea, bluetail 
Feb 20 18:00:11 <edu4rdshl>	Ah, missed context :p
Feb 20 19:04:35 <Dex2x>	oh this is awesome, bootctl has gotten a long way from where it was, I don't have to make the loader.conf file now manually 
Feb 20 19:10:22 <gehidore>	fancy
Feb 20 19:21:33 <Dex2x>	ikr 
Feb 20 19:23:15 <tc_>	Is their anyone who has any experience with "Tiny Core Linux" (current releases)??
Feb 20 19:24:30 <hackfoo>	tc_: Not sure if that's relevant to #archlinux
Feb 20 19:26:00 <tc_>	hackfoo: Ok
Feb 20 19:45:20 <Dex2x>	arg need to figure out how to update the EFI variables for the bootloader
Feb 20 19:57:22 <Dex2x>	Namarrgon, so oddly getting that same PGP error when in arch-chroot 
Feb 20 19:59:59 <Dex2x>	ah okay outside did the pacman-key --init and sorted 
Feb 20 20:00:10 *	Dex2x gives Namarrgon a Bells :D 
Feb 20 20:18:51 <Rayyan>	hello does anyone know how to shrink the default gnome dash in the activities view
Feb 20 20:19:01 <Rayyan>	the size of the icons are way too large compared to my screen
Feb 20 20:19:49 <mrms>	Hi I'm trying to connect my Wacom Intuos using bluetooth. It connects and shows up as a pointing device, but I don't get any input from it. Connecting through USB works ok. I have these errors in the bluetooth log: https://paste.sr.ht/blob/d3af0c3b64f1316835105bd3f615d3d319541a09. Any ideas?
Feb 20 21:34:56 <Vorpal>	ssh agent in KDE from gnome's secret service seems broken today? Worked yesterday. SSH_AUTH_SOCK isn't set. Using X11. Not sure where to even start debugging this. How was it set before?
Feb 20 21:35:31 <Vorpal>	That is the one part of gnome I use (because kwallet really sucks and doesn't implement dbus secret service)
Feb 20 21:39:05 <Vorpal>	gnome-keyring-daemon.service is running in the user session, so that isn't it

Feb 20 22:23:18 <kenzu>	I need ideas on what to make
Feb 20 22:23:25 <kenzu>	to continue learn/having fun
Feb 20 22:24:18 <NetSysFire>	this is #archlinux and this distro is specifically not for arm. i recommend #linux or #archlinuxarm, since some things we may recommend wont apply to alarm
Feb 20 22:29:19 <kenzu>	I know
Feb 20 22:29:25 <kenzu>	Im asking a general question
Feb 20 22:29:33 <kenzu>	not distro-dependend
Feb 20 22:29:34 <alad>	your general question is offtopic for this channel
Feb 20 22:29:40 <kenzu>	allrighty
Feb 20 22:30:02 <kenzu>	this community is kind of ... meh
Feb 20 22:31:33 <alad>	bon voyage

Feb 20 22:33:38 <alad>	jelle

Feb 20 22:34:22 <NetSysFire>	zbe
Feb 20 22:34:42 <zbe>	jelle, dependecy of rpm-tools: rpm-sequoia isn't in arch repo?
Feb 20 22:36:10 <zbe>	dependency*
Feb 20 22:36:24 <Metroid>	it's available as an AUR fwiw

Feb 20 22:38:41 <mpan>	Though, on a serious note, indeed it is in extra-testing. Not pushed to extra. Sounds like a bug.
Feb 20 22:49:11 <Dex2x>	Okay so booted, yet my gpg keys for pacman is still messed up, pacman-key --init tells me agent_genkey failed, no such file or directory 
Feb 20 22:51:53 <Dex2x>	ah reboot needed >.> 
Feb 20 22:51:56 <wyre>	is there some way to flush the cached ram and swap? 🤔
Feb 20 22:52:06 <wyre>	I mean some "appropriate" way
Feb 20 22:52:28 <wyre>	and ... well not sure if this will have some impact on performance 🤔
Feb 20 22:58:03 <virtualsid>	gromit: thanks for opening that issue. I should've thought of doing that.
Feb 20 23:02:57 <wyre>	well, it makes sense my question? 😆
Feb 20 23:04:05 <virtualsid>	well, that was weird. Trying to open that issue link caused my machine to crap out in a weird way. First, I was able to scroll up and down in irssi (running remotely, through mosh/tmux), flick to my i3 workspace with firefox, but not seeing the link open, and flicking back and forth a few times. Then the terminal disappeared, then the browser became unresponsive, and then after typing in a username 
Feb 20 23:04:11 <virtualsid>	in a virtual console, the login screen blanked out in the VC.
Feb 20 23:04:41 <virtualsid>	hard rebooted, and, everything is back to normal.
Feb 20 23:51:51 <susi>	wyre: there is, but it's about never appropriate for anyone asking about this
Feb 20 23:52:03 <susi>	you may search about "drop caches linux"
Feb 20 23:52:55 <susi>	also: man proc and section about /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
Feb 20 23:53:01 <Pikk3wyn>	wyre: yes
Feb 20 23:53:04 <Pikk3wyn>	also, don't use 1
Feb 20 23:53:13 <Pikk3wyn>	i believe 3? is the one to use
Feb 20 23:53:14 <Pikk3wyn>	but
Feb 20 23:53:17 <Pikk3wyn>	probably dont
Feb 20 23:53:19 <susi>	don't use anything, if you don't know what you are doing and why you are doing it
Feb 20 23:53:23 <Pikk3wyn>	what reason do you have to do that?
Feb 20 23:53:33 <Pikk3wyn>	because you 99.99% probably do not want to
Feb 20 23:54:06 <susi>	kernel and stuff are better handling this memory stuff than you are
Feb 20 23:54:08 <Pikk3wyn>	and unless you have an absolute technical reason that you can say with certainty, that there is a PROBLEM with the cache in some way, do not do this
Feb 20 23:54:26 <susi>	it's not like echoing some values is going to beat the algorithmics of the System just like that
Feb 20 23:54:38 <Pikk3wyn>	legit
Feb 20 23:56:22 <Pikk3wyn>	I think a good rule of thumb is 'if you have to ask how to drop the cache, you should not be dropping the cache' ;)
Feb 20 23:56:39 <Pikk3wyn>	and even if you do know, you still shouldnt be anyway
Feb 20 23:57:13 <Pikk3wyn>	only reason i can think of is for debugging different vfs pressure or something to see how it affects performance from a clean state
Feb 20 23:57:35 <susi>	I think there are some "legit" special cases when it's justified, but when this occurs, 
Feb 20 23:57:47 <susi>	it's something I don't understand about
Feb 20 23:58:18 <Pikk3wyn>	i think sometimes things can like, get a lot of overcomitted cache pages that go dirty but dont want to remove
Feb 20 23:58:20 <Pikk3wyn>	or something
Feb 20 23:58:26 <Pikk3wyn>	happened with a db once
Feb 20 23:58:54 <Pikk3wyn>	it was up for months as well
Feb 21 00:00:23 <Pikk3wyn>	wyre: may need to man 5 proc since tcl has a 'proc' man aswell
Feb 21 00:03:01 <wyre>	well, we're using OpenFoam for a parallel computation with multiple machines involved
Feb 21 00:03:15 <wyre>	and for some reason they fill the cache
Feb 21 00:03:26 <wyre>	they still work ... but not sure if this could cause some issue
Feb 21 00:03:40 <Pikk3wyn>	that's normal
Feb 21 00:03:56 <Pikk3wyn>	wyre: the cache should theoretically be as big as possible
Feb 21 00:04:07 <Pikk3wyn>	in free -h you can see free and available
Feb 21 00:04:16 <Pikk3wyn>	that cache is mostly part of available
Feb 21 00:04:25 <wyre>	I see
Feb 21 00:04:38 <Pikk3wyn>	the ram is still 'available' if needed, it's just using spare ram to improve performance
Feb 21 00:04:53 <wyre>	yeah I guess
Feb 21 00:04:56 <wyre>	thank you guys :-D
Feb 21 00:05:24 <Pikk3wyn>	sweet
Feb 21 00:07:12 <susi>	I use zram instead of swap, so this concerns me even less
Feb 21 00:07:30 <Pikk3wyn>	susi: how much ram do you have
Feb 21 00:07:37 <Pikk3wyn>	and what storage devices?
Feb 21 00:07:42 <Pikk3wyn>	and cpu?
Feb 21 00:07:45 <susi>	8G now, used to have just 4G (3.7 really available)
Feb 21 00:08:06 <Pikk3wyn>	and storage/cpu?
Feb 21 00:08:15 <Pikk3wyn>	do you have an SSD?
Feb 21 00:08:17 <susi>	some pentium silver mobile shit
Feb 21 00:08:21 <susi>	no, an eMMC
Feb 21 00:08:29 <Pikk3wyn>	?
Feb 21 00:08:40 <susi>	eMMC flash memory
Feb 21 00:08:47 <Pikk3wyn>	like an SD card?
Feb 21 00:08:48 <susi>	for a disk
Feb 21 00:08:53 <susi>	kinda
Feb 21 00:08:57 <Pikk3wyn>	how fast is it
Feb 21 00:09:10 <susi>	it's not fast, but it's enough for me
Feb 21 00:09:20 <Pikk3wyn>	i mean how fast
Feb 21 00:09:24 <Pikk3wyn>	like is it faster than hdd
Feb 21 00:09:30 <Pikk3wyn>	how many MB/s?
Feb 21 00:09:42 <demonicmaniac1>	emmc is simply onboard flash - just like in your phone
Feb 21 00:10:12 <Pikk3wyn>	ja, but emmc comes in many different qualities
Feb 21 00:10:12 <demonicmaniac1>	faster than sdcard or usb stick, access times are ssd like, write/read is usually on the 100 to 200mb/s depending on age
Feb 21 00:10:25 <Pikk3wyn>	susi: you should not be using zram then :)
Feb 21 00:10:36 <demonicmaniac1>	at the very least it has wear leveling
Feb 21 00:10:39 <Pikk3wyn>	zram trades cpu cycles for decreased ram usage
Feb 21 00:10:55 <Pikk3wyn>	if your storage is faster than an hdd, and cpu is slow, zram is worse
Feb 21 00:11:02 <Pikk3wyn>	also, NEVER use it *instead* of swap
Feb 21 00:11:04 <susi>	now I have 1376Mi of zram with default compression 
Feb 21 00:11:10 <Pikk3wyn>	there needs to be some swap always
Feb 21 00:11:16 <susi>	instead of a 2,5G swap partition
Feb 21 00:11:21 <Pikk3wyn>	you can use a file
Feb 21 00:11:39 <demonicmaniac1>	tl;dr make a small swap file and simply use frontzswap with zstd
Feb 21 00:11:44 <susi>	zram's my swap
Feb 21 00:12:01 <demonicmaniac1>	frontzswap is better than zram in a trillion ways
Feb 21 00:12:05 <Pikk3wyn>	sudo sh -c 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/SWAP status=progress bs=4M; mkswap /SWAP; swapon /SWAP'
Feb 21 00:12:20 <susi>	who are you talking to?
Feb 21 00:12:22 <Pikk3wyn>	sudo sh -c 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/SWAP status=progress bs=1M count=4096; mkswap /SWAP; swapon /SWAP'
Feb 21 00:12:23 <Pikk3wyn>	haha
Feb 21 00:12:41 <Pikk3wyn>	susi: sudo sh -c 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/SWAP status=progress bs=1M count=4096; mkswap /SWAP; swapon /SWAP'
Feb 21 00:12:51 <Pikk3wyn>	you dont need a partition
Feb 21 00:13:08 <susi>	ok?
Feb 21 00:13:14 <Pikk3wyn>	you can even have it allocate chunk swapfiles with systemd-swap, start eg: 2gb and increase if needed
Feb 21 00:13:20 <Pikk3wyn>	never have no real swap
Feb 21 00:13:28 <Pikk3wyn>	zram is not a replacement for swap
Feb 21 00:13:42 <susi>	it is for me, and has been for years
Feb 21 00:13:52 <Pikk3wyn>	you shouldnt tho
Feb 21 00:14:02 <demonicmaniac1>	susi has swap on a zram backing device instead of disk swap - it IS a swap file just on a tmpfs ramdisk instead of storage
Feb 21 00:14:08 <susi>	if this works for me, I don't see why I shouldn't 
Feb 21 00:14:19 <Pikk3wyn>	demonicmaniac1: it won't fix an OOM
Feb 21 00:14:26 <Pikk3wyn>	i'm not saying dont use zram ever
Feb 21 00:14:35 <susi>	OOMs shouldn't occur any way
Feb 21 00:14:36 <Pikk3wyn>	i'm saying you should always have actual swap also
Feb 21 00:14:43 <demonicmaniac1>	i'm saying don't  use zram ever because frontzswap is smarter :)
Feb 21 00:14:44 <Pikk3wyn>	just set low prio anyway if you want
Feb 21 00:14:45 <susi>	I can spot memory pressure before it's critical
Feb 21 00:15:16 <Pikk3wyn>	just create a 4gb swapfile or something and swapon low prio automatically lol
Feb 21 00:15:17 <susi>	it's not just setting a zram, but also configuring lots of stuff to behave accordingly
Feb 21 00:15:28 <Pikk3wyn>	it could save you one day
Feb 21 00:15:35 <susi>	no, I'll do what I've been doing succesfully for years
Feb 21 00:15:42 <susi>	and keep this current setting
Feb 21 00:15:48 <Pikk3wyn>	it's not like it will make anything worse
Feb 21 00:15:52 <Pikk3wyn>	feel free haha
Feb 21 00:16:13 <susi>	it's not like I have free disk space anywhere, nor would setting it as a swap would do anything less worse
Feb 21 00:16:14 <Pikk3wyn>	it's best procedure to always have some real swap
Feb 21 00:16:39 <Pikk3wyn>	it would not do anything worse, and may save you in OOM :P
Feb 21 00:16:41 <susi>	OOM is not a 'normal' situation
Feb 21 00:16:53 <susi>	the point is to spot pressure before it's critical, and mitigate it before OOM
Feb 21 00:17:09 <Pikk3wyn>	if you don't have 4gb free space that's a bigger danger even lol
Feb 21 00:17:10 <susi>	I can handle everything without backing stuff onto permanent flash
Feb 21 00:17:20 <Pikk3wyn>	susi: how much free do you have?
Feb 21 00:17:28 <susi>	I used to have just 3,7 G of available RAM
Feb 21 00:17:33 <Pikk3wyn>	why
Feb 21 00:17:36 <susi>	everything was just like it's now with double 
Feb 21 00:17:47 <Pikk3wyn>	how can you ahve 3.7 ram
Feb 21 00:17:56 <Pikk3wyn>	available, or total?
Feb 21 00:18:11 <susi>	can't see any difference but maybe may have more non-unloaded tabs open in firefox, but that does not affect my workflow
Feb 21 00:18:40 <susi>	ofc it would make compiling and stuff also more pleasent, but this computer is for hobby stuff, networking and upholding social life
Feb 21 00:18:57 <Pikk3wyn>	susi: do you not have 4gb of space to prevent a possible future explosion
Feb 21 00:19:01 <Pikk3wyn>	if you run out of storage space, there is going to be a lot of stuff spazzing out into ram
Feb 21 00:19:23 <Pikk3wyn>	haha, don't do it if you dont want 
Feb 21 00:19:33 <Pikk3wyn>	your call im not gonna try convince you more
Feb 21 00:20:09 <Pikk3wyn>	that 4gb file might save your ass and has no downside, its up to you XD
Feb 21 00:20:24 <susi>	https://0x0.st/H5-x.txt here's my `free -m' for you to be amazed about!
Feb 21 00:21:00 <Pikk3wyn>	what is amazing about it
Feb 21 00:22:37 <gehidore>	so amazed
Feb 21 00:23:10 <Namarrgon>	undermazing
Feb 21 00:26:07 <Pikk3wyn>	so you're using zram, and putting your swap on zram?
Feb 21 00:26:15 <tanath>	lol
Feb 21 00:26:20 <susi>	yeah
Feb 21 00:26:20 <Pikk3wyn>	as opposed to zswap?
Feb 21 00:26:31 <susi>	yeah, I've disabled zswappin
Feb 21 00:27:42 <Pikk3wyn>	i recall reading that zswap is recommended over swap on zram in the documentation
Feb 21 00:28:20 <susi>	>The difference compared to zram is that zswap works in conjunction with a swap device while zram with created swap on top of it is a swap device in RAM that does not require a backing swap device. 
Feb 21 00:28:49 <susi>	>If the related zswap kernel feature remains enabled, it will prevent zram from being used effectively. This is because zswap functions as a swap cache in front of zram, intercepting and compressing evicted memory pages before they can reach zram. Despite the output of zramctl(8), most of zswap is unused in this circumstance. Therefore, it's recommended to permanently disable zswap using the kernel 
Feb 21 00:28:55 <susi>	parameter or sysfs setting before starting.a
Feb 21 00:28:57 <susi>	from the wiki
Feb 21 00:29:01 <Pikk3wyn>	ja
Feb 21 00:29:27 <Pikk3wyn>	you will have benefits of the cache+compression and still have some actual swap
Feb 21 00:29:50 <susi>	I just want to know when memory pressure nears critical
Feb 21 00:30:03 <susi>	so I can pre-emptively un-able ooms
Feb 21 00:30:16 <Pikk3wyn>	why do you not want to be safe from oom 
Feb 21 00:30:31 <susi>	something's wrong within my setup if ooms happen
Feb 21 00:31:31 <susi>	OOMs are not something normal that you are expected to deal with on constant basis
Feb 21 00:31:39 <Pikk3wyn>	something is wrong with your setup lol, the ooms just havent happened because there hasnt been a leak / large enough thing to cause it :P
Feb 21 00:31:52 <Pikk3wyn>	the reason we always have a bit of swap is to prevent an actual oom
Feb 21 00:32:12 <susi>	and what then when swap is full too?
Feb 21 00:32:16 <susi>	how is it different 
Feb 21 00:32:19 <Pikk3wyn>	with only zram swap you run the risk of catastrophic oom versus writing some to swap
Feb 21 00:32:22 <Pikk3wyn>	i will explain
Feb 21 00:33:15 <Pikk3wyn>	linux can somewhat overcommit memory allocations, it is normally not a problem, but in a very low mem situation, it may commit more than it physically has
Feb 21 00:33:28 <Pikk3wyn>	if it has a bit of swap to fall over to, then you avoid catastrophic failure
Feb 21 00:33:50 <susi>	and if my swap were on eMMC flash it would somehow be different on these low memory situations/
Feb 21 00:33:58 <Pikk3wyn>	yes
Feb 21 00:34:01 <susi>	memory can't run out when swap resides on permanent storage?
Feb 21 00:34:19 <susi>	I think you miss something about zram
Feb 21 00:34:25 <Pikk3wyn>	it is very unlikely to reach an actual bona fide OOM
Feb 21 00:34:43 <susi>	sounds like my system behaves right now
Feb 21 00:35:09 <susi>	the difference is that the swap device is not backed by permanent storage
Feb 21 00:35:49 <susi>	I already have a 'swap', it shows in my /proc/swaps
Feb 21 00:36:01 <gehidore>	you burn through all your ram and start swapping heavy and you'll have a seriously unusable system anyways

Feb 21 00:53:37 *	Topic for #archlinux set by phrik!~phrik@phrik.archlinux.org (Sat Feb 10 18:25:44 2024)
Feb 21 00:53:43 <Pikk3wyn>	it's just that your cpu is REALLY weak
Feb 21 00:53:50 <virtualsid>	wait, what, linux-zen? I thought it was something to do with xen, and therefore I didn't need to care. I guess something to look into...
Feb 21 00:53:57 <susi>	except I get 300+% better everything with practically no cost by doing what you say
Feb 21 00:54:04 <Pikk3wyn>	virtualsid: everyone basically should be using it
Feb 21 00:54:12 <Pikk3wyn>	susi: you lose 28% total swap size
Feb 21 00:54:19 <Pikk3wyn>	thats the tradeoff
Feb 21 00:54:34 <Pikk3wyn>	the defaults are good, but not always the best for desktop use
Feb 21 00:54:37 <virtualsid>	Pikk3wyn: appreciate that you mentioned it. I'm reading about it now :)
Feb 21 00:54:46 <Pikk3wyn>	sweet
Feb 21 00:55:12 <virtualsid>	btw, when you say 'desktop' I assume you mean 'non server', i.e. laptops will benefit too
Feb 21 00:55:12 <Pikk3wyn>	it tunes a LOT of stuff for latency and responsiveness + optimise for desktop use
Feb 21 00:55:13 <susi>	I've been using linux-zen for these three years, but can't say why or if it gives any benefits
Feb 21 00:55:19 <Pikk3wyn>	virtualsid: 100% yeah
Feb 21 00:55:23 <susi>	at least it stays in sync with upstream
Feb 21 00:55:25 <Pikk3wyn>	laptops will benefit more infact
Feb 21 00:55:27 <Pikk3wyn>	as far as i know
Feb 21 00:56:01 <Pikk3wyn>	i have tested and i can notice an improvement in input latency
Feb 21 00:56:07 <Pikk3wyn>	it's not MASSIVE
Feb 21 00:56:17 <virtualsid>	Can't say I notice any sort of latency issues in general.
Feb 21 00:56:32 <Pikk3wyn>	not saying there was an issue
Feb 21 00:56:32 <whiteman809>	should I create partition table on my new devices gpt or mbr? i mean stuff like pendrives, external usb hdds
Feb 21 00:56:50 <Pikk3wyn>	but removing all other factors and testing the game as my whole graphical session, I did notice a very mild improvement in mouse latency
Feb 21 00:57:09 <Pikk3wyn>	its the sort of thing you really gotta know the game and pay attention to notice
Feb 21 00:57:10 <Pikk3wyn>	:P
Feb 21 00:57:15 <whiteman809>	i want to create /dev/sdx1 partition and then cryptsetup, format /dev/mapper/mydata as ext4
Feb 21 00:57:23 <Pikk3wyn>	whiteman809: gpt if you got uefi
Feb 21 00:57:40 <Pikk3wyn>	whiteman809: gpt in general
Feb 21 00:57:43 <Pikk3wyn>	what device is it?
Feb 21 00:57:51 <whiteman809>	pendrive and external usb hdds
Feb 21 00:58:01 <Pikk3wyn>	and what mobo? is it legacy bios, or uefi?
Feb 21 00:58:04 <whiteman809>	uefi
Feb 21 00:58:08 <Pikk3wyn>	use gpt
Feb 21 00:58:30 <Pikk3wyn>	also, what are you installing it on
Feb 21 00:58:48 <whiteman809>	i'm going to store my data only
Feb 21 00:59:13 <Pikk3wyn>	ideally you should install it internally, or is it a laptop
Feb 21 00:59:18 <Pikk3wyn>	the device i mean :)
Feb 21 00:59:57 <whiteman809>	i want to use external usb hdd and pendrives to move data between different linux computers
Feb 21 01:00:07 <whiteman809>	not every my computer have uefi
Feb 21 01:00:16 <Pikk3wyn>	that's fine
Feb 21 01:00:25 <Pikk3wyn>	linux can still read it no problem
Feb 21 01:00:49 <Pikk3wyn>	it's just if you want to boot it on a box without uefi, it needs an mbr
Feb 21 01:01:06 <Pikk3wyn>	so always use gpt
Feb 21 01:01:17 <whiteman809>	so do you recommend to create partition table on these usb devices with gpt and prefer gpt on every new device?
Feb 21 01:01:40 <Pikk3wyn>	use anything
Feb 21 01:01:45 <Pikk3wyn>	fdisk, gdisk, parted
Feb 21 01:01:55 <whiteman809>	i want to use cfdisk
Feb 21 01:02:05 <Pikk3wyn>	there is no way to prefer gpt on new device, because you choose when you are partitioning it
Feb 21 01:02:30 <Pikk3wyn>	you can create a new partition table with type gpt
Feb 21 01:03:03 <whiteman809>	yeah, i want to create partition table with cfdisk
Feb 21 01:03:27 <Namarrgon>	yes, use gpt
Feb 21 01:03:35 <Pikk3wyn>	whiteman809: its right there in it :)
Feb 21 01:03:36 <Pikk3wyn>	press h
Feb 21 01:03:52 <whiteman809>	thank you for help
Feb 21 01:03:55 <whiteman809>	i'll use gpt
Feb 21 01:04:18 <Pikk3wyn>	i recommend fdisk tho
Feb 21 01:04:38 <Pikk3wyn>	just tried to run cfdisk and the error was 'cfdisk: cannot open /dev/sda: No such file or directory' lmaooooo
Feb 21 01:04:44 <virtualsid>	oh? I really like cfdisk too. Been using it for forever.
Feb 21 01:04:48 <Pikk3wyn>	not 'bad usage, run --help'
Feb 21 01:05:04 <Pikk3wyn>	that is dumb as hell that it tries to open /dev/sda
Feb 21 01:05:06 <Namarrgon>	cfdisk is fdisk
Feb 21 01:05:07 <Pikk3wyn>	automatically
Feb 21 01:05:09 <Pikk3wyn>	ja
Feb 21 01:05:23 <Namarrgon>	as is sfdisk, they are all part of the same package
Feb 21 01:05:37 <Pikk3wyn>	but based on the fact it tried to read /dev/sda without me asking, it gives me sketchy vibes
Feb 21 01:06:01 <Pikk3wyn>	i'm sure its all good haha
Feb 21 01:08:08 <Pikk3wyn>	interface looks pretty nice
Feb 21 01:09:19 <Pikk3wyn>	always remember to specify size like +500G and use the default start location
Feb 21 01:09:36 <Pikk3wyn>	so it aligns properly
Feb 21 01:10:45 <Pikk3wyn>	if it's just a thin frontend i assume you should still add the +, since it seems to be presenting the actual fdisk for input
Feb 21 01:11:59 <Pikk3wyn>	whiteman809: also ensure to use the optimal cryptsetup params
Feb 21 01:15:17 <virtualsid>	btw, I think cfdisk is not just a skin on fdisk. I thought it was a long time ago, but I am sure it's actually separate.
Feb 21 01:16:17 <Pikk3wyn>	it's smaller than fdisk
Feb 21 01:16:43 <Pikk3wyn>	considering it has a gui i'd assume it would be bigger if it had the same functionality
Feb 21 01:16:54 <virtualsid>	https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/blob/master/disk-utils/cfdisk.c#L14 - 'inspired by fdisk'
Feb 21 01:17:01 <Pikk3wyn>	ah
Feb 21 01:17:12 <Pikk3wyn>	i guess it doesnt have all the functionality then
Feb 21 01:17:52 <virtualsid>	it does not, it says to use fdisk for more advanced functionality :) But it's part of the same package of utils - util-linux - which I only learned today :) They do seem to share code.
Feb 21 01:18:47 <Pikk3wyn>	ja, both have libfdisk and stuff
Feb 21 01:18:55 <Pikk3wyn>	god, the dynamic linking these days is insane
Feb 21 01:19:01 <Pikk3wyn>	linux is fuckin magical
Feb 21 01:19:40 <virtualsid>	:)
Feb 21 01:20:54 <Pikk3wyn>	i am a bit superstitious about partitioning with a gui
Feb 21 01:21:14 <Pikk3wyn>	i get paranoid if i don't see and enter exactly what is needed
Feb 21 01:21:30 <Pikk3wyn>	lol
Feb 21 01:28:36 <jb1277976>	Is there any point in using the nix package manager with there is pacman an aur ?
Feb 21 01:30:38 <tanath>	depends if you want what nix is good for, or a package that's in nix but not there
Feb 21 01:30:52 <tanath>	nix stuff is meant to be reproduceable
Feb 21 01:31:14 <Pikk3wyn>	jb1277976: unless you have a specific reason, no
Feb 21 01:32:01 <jb1277976>	That's what i thought. they bost 80,000 packages the largest ever. i just went to the aur and it said 93,000  =)
Feb 21 01:32:11 <jb1277976>	s/bost/boast/
Feb 21 01:32:37 <Pikk3wyn>	those numbers are not relevant really or comparable
Feb 21 01:33:00 <Pikk3wyn>	aur can have 15 packages for 1 program hehe
Feb 21 01:33:27 <Pikk3wyn>	not a bad thing, atleast 12 of the 15 are probably useful variations
Feb 21 01:34:34 <Pikk3wyn>	it's more important if the package manager is solid, and works in a way you like
Feb 21 01:34:47 <Pikk3wyn>	personally i think pacman is the best thing since sliced bread
Feb 21 01:38:00 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 21 01:38:01 *	litharge removes ban on $a:XZDX
Feb 21 01:38:01 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 21 01:38:33 <d3Xt3r>	jb1277976: its handy if you're on an immutable OS, so not really relevant for arch. But it can be handy for trying out things which have a ton of dependencies, so it doesn't mess up your main OS files/pacman. And it supports easy rollbacks. 
Feb 21 01:39:58 <virtualsid>	NixOS is too new for me. I need to wait another 5+ years, when it's dropped off the radar, and I then start using it, and go 'wow, this thing is amazing!', while everyone else has moved onto newer things
Feb 21 01:40:13 <mefistofeles>	lol
Feb 21 01:40:21 <virtualsid>	(I may or may not be reliving my docker/container usage experience here)
Feb 21 01:44:22 <Pikk3wyn>	virtualsid: does it use docker for lots of stuff?
Feb 21 01:44:31 <Pikk3wyn>	i havent really messed with nixos at all
Feb 21 01:44:57 <virtualsid>	I have absolutely no idea, haah
Feb 21 01:45:05 <virtualsid>	ask me in 5 years
Feb 21 01:46:15 <d3Xt3r>	jb1277976: one of the things I didn't like about Nix (well, Nixpkgs to be exact) is that there wasn't a way to easily flag a package as 'out-of-date' - you'd have to manually send the maintainers an email, which I thought was a bit too confrontational. Like for instance there was this one time I wanted to install freerdp when the had the big update, and I didn't want to bother the maintainers so I didn't email them and thought since it wasn't some obscure
Feb 21 01:46:15 <d3Xt3r>	 package, it should get updated after some time. So I waited a week, then a couple of weeks and still nothing. (This was on an immutable OS btw). Ended up using Arch in a distrobox container and installing it that way.
Feb 21 01:47:03 <d3Xt3r>	Actually, looks like Nix *still* haven't picked up the new freerdp LOL - they're still stuck on 2.11.5. So much for boasting about those 80,000 packages...
Feb 21 01:47:35 <d3Xt3r>	https://search.nixos.org/packages#?channel=unstable&query=freerdp
Feb 21 01:47:35 <phrik>	Title: NixOS Search (at search.nixos.org)
Feb 21 01:47:39 <virtualsid>	oof
Feb 21 01:48:54 <Pikk3wyn>	immutable OS?
Feb 21 01:49:51 <d3Xt3r>	Pikk3wyn: yep, where the root fs (or core system paths) are read-only, and your OS update is delivered as a single image and is atomic in nature (ie it either works, or doesn't).
Feb 21 01:49:57 <Pikk3wyn>	d3Xt3r: that info alone is enough that I would never consider using it
Feb 21 01:50:09 <Pikk3wyn>	that's only useful for stuff like steamos
Feb 21 01:50:12 <virtualsid>	heh
Feb 21 01:50:29 <d3Xt3r>	Pikk3wyn: exactly, well, or any other purpose-built device. It's handy for such systems.
Feb 21 01:50:32 <Pikk3wyn>	which needs as-is updates and makes sense for a consumer product
Feb 21 01:51:00 <Pikk3wyn>	d3Xt3r: what such systems is it used for is my question :P
Feb 21 01:51:00 <d3Xt3r>	Pikk3wyn: I use one of them on a laptop I use almost exclusively for gaming. And I like that it just works, no need for me to maintain it.
Feb 21 01:51:26 <virtualsid>	interesting use case
Feb 21 01:51:51 <Pikk3wyn>	it's a pretty niche usecase tho, a handheld gaming thing
Feb 21 01:52:06 <Pikk3wyn>	d3Xt3r: what games you play?
Feb 21 01:52:22 <virtualsid>	I thought it might be useful for a sort of security aspect too, for 'microservices', etc.
Feb 21 01:52:36 <d3Xt3r>	Pikk3wyn: mostly ARPGs and RTSes. So games like Diablo 2, Age of Empires 2 etc.
Feb 21 01:53:05 <Pikk3wyn>	fair i guess, not super demanding stuff
Feb 21 01:53:31 <Pikk3wyn>	i couldn't even imagine the idea of a static rootfs image that i gotta install a new version or something
Feb 21 01:53:41 <Pikk3wyn>	probably i'd go mad
Feb 21 01:54:05 <d3Xt3r>	virtualsid: yep, there are some security-oriented immutable distros, and "cloud native" ones for container workloads.
Feb 21 01:55:47 <Pikk3wyn>	what security benefit you would get from that other than being able to verify the hash
Feb 21 01:56:06 <virtualsid>	not being able to write to as many files :)
Feb 21 01:57:23 <Pikk3wyn>	how would that help if the files are owned by root anyway
Feb 21 01:57:42 <virtualsid>	even if they are, they're still not writable, is my understanding
Feb 21 02:00:10 <d3Xt3r>	I mean, ultimately if you've got root access to a system all bets are off.. but it would be handy for a multi-user setup, like say a kiosk computer, or say a school/work computer where you may not want to give the end user root privs.
Feb 21 02:00:20 <Pikk3wyn>	ja
Feb 21 02:00:22 <Pikk3wyn>	I'
Feb 21 02:02:21 <Pikk3wyn>	I'm reading abit now, it seems most of them have some CoW overlay that's discarded on reboot
Feb 21 02:02:40 <Pikk3wyn>	basically a live system 
Feb 21 02:04:20 <Pikk3wyn>	that uses exclusively flatpak and appimage and crap for packages
Feb 21 02:04:36 <Pikk3wyn>	or add it to a CoW overlay that is then applied on reboot or something
Feb 21 02:05:22 <Pikk3wyn>	server container workloads i can see it being useful i guess
Feb 21 02:05:30 <d3Xt3r>	It's nice having it on my laptop. I just turn it on, it boots directly into Steam. Updates are automatic and apply to the image in the background, without any interference. I shutdown my system and the next time I turn it on, it's running the latest image. If it doesn't work for whatever reason, I can select the previous image from GRUB.
Feb 21 02:06:43 <Pikk3wyn>	ah you are using actual steamos?
Feb 21 02:07:26 <d3Xt3r>	It's a SteamOS-inspired distro, with a more recent kernel/mesa/proton + more tweaks and stuff.
Feb 21 02:07:46 <Pikk3wyn>	what's the name?
Feb 21 02:07:51 <d3Xt3r>	Bazzite
Feb 21 02:09:34 <Pikk3wyn>	oh god it's all flatpaks and stuff
Feb 21 02:10:48 <d3Xt3r>	Pikk3wyn: you don't *have* to use flatpak. You can also use Nix and Distrobox containers to install stuff.
Feb 21 02:11:51 <Pikk3wyn>	containerised packages are not for me hehe
Feb 21 02:12:05 <Pikk3wyn>	cool that it works well for you tho :)
Feb 21 02:42:12 <Psi-Jack>	Hmm.. I have an issue with aurto. I'm trying to add devilspie2 to aurto for building and maintaining my own local package for, but when I add it, it gets stuck on: ==> Locking chroot copy [psi-jack]...
Feb 21 02:51:57 <felsokning>	Psi-Jack: aurto is an AUR package. Probably best getting help from the maintainers. https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aurto
Feb 21 02:52:01 <phrik>	Title: AUR (en) - aurto (at aur.archlinux.org)
Feb 21 02:53:44 <rcf>	Psi-Jack: sounds like a lockfile somewhere
Feb 21 03:06:26 <Psi-Jack>	Yeah, I found it. It was indeed a lock file.
Feb 21 03:06:45 <Psi-Jack>	Course, devilspie2 itself fails to verify gpg signature, so I get to report that issue.
Feb 21 03:35:21 <Steven_M>	Hi, iptables-nft is a dependency of an application I'd like to install. The problem is, iptables and iptables-nft conflict with each other. My question is: If I replace iptables with iptables-nft, would it cause problems with the other network software on my system?
Feb 21 03:39:00 <tirnanog>	you should not have a ruleset loaded against the xtables backend throuhg iptables, then proceed to manipulate the nftables backend with iptables-nft. if you arready have a ruleset loaded, flush it out, then reload it with iptables-nft once installed. 
Feb 21 03:39:08 <axq>	i don't think so. iptables should no longer be used anyway, as it has been replaced by nftables. but there are compatibility layers to transfer old rules
Feb 21 03:39:17 <tirnanog>	if you don't already have a ruleset loaded, there is nothing to worry about.
Feb 21 03:39:31 <axq>	*if any
Feb 21 03:39:45 <tirnanog>	you can run iptables-save to check.
Feb 21 03:41:03 <tirnanog>	better, iptables-legacy-save.

Feb 21 05:52:04 <virtualsid>	I was wondering why that wasn't the easiest option - laptop keyboard, perhaps?
Feb 21 05:52:53 <rcf>	Almost certainly. 
Feb 21 05:54:33 <tijko>	edu4rdshl but now though
Feb 21 05:54:40 <tijko>	what do i do for now?
Feb 21 05:56:18 <edu4rdshl>	If it's night, go and rest, then buy one in the morning :p
Feb 21 06:15:18 <tijko>	w3lp i'm down to coding by pounding that 'e' button
Feb 21 07:31:33 <Psi-Jack>	tijko: At this point you're just being annoying.
Feb 21 07:31:49 <intelfx>	is there any specific place to report inconsistencies between packages in the official repos?
Feb 21 07:32:22 <intelfx>	i. e. not a specific package bug per se, but rather "package extra/A=x.y.z depends on package B=a.b.c which does not exist in extra"
Feb 21 07:33:23 <intelfx>	*in core or extra
Feb 21 07:46:32 <rcf>	intelfx: create an issue on the gitlab for package A, after verifying it's not something like a mirror problem 
Feb 21 07:49:16 <intelfx>	doesn't look like a mirror problem
Feb 21 07:49:22 <intelfx>	oh, it's already reported :>
Feb 21 08:08:00 <edu4rdshl>	Let me guess, rpm-sequoia <-> rpm-tools
Feb 21 08:09:53 <rcf>	bloody jelle 
Feb 21 08:21:07 <linuxfan>	Hi all. i have an issue with SD card reader module today, on the wiki community there is a solution that asks to install rtsx_usb_mmc module for my card reader which lsusb identifies. But getting an error - Module rtsx_usb_mmc not found in directory /lib/modules/6.7.5-arch1-1
Feb 21 08:21:26 <linuxfan>	is there anywhere i can download this module and install using pacman?
Feb 21 08:23:54 <Psi-Jack>	linuxfan: Was there a package mentioned in the wiki
Feb 21 08:24:00 <mrkiko>	Is there a changelog/a place to see a changelog for a package update? For example, the latest openssh package update?
Feb 21 08:25:49 <predicament>	: Do you want to skip the above package for this upgrade? [y/N] n
Feb 21 08:25:49 <predicament>	error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies)
Feb 21 08:25:49 <predicament>	:: unable to satisfy dependency 'rpm-sequoia' required by rpm-tools
Feb 21 08:26:20 <predicament>	sigh
Feb 21 08:27:40 <predicament>	i changed my mirrors and made sure they were up to date, if i skip that it works fine, but i dotn want to skip it. 
Feb 21 08:28:21 <predicament>	rpm-tools is important
Feb 21 08:28:39 <predicament>	to me, anyway
Feb 21 08:32:25 <linuxfan>	@Psi-Jack yes, on the bbs.archlinux.org site there is a solution - "Need to load rtsx_usb_mmc module". and i just realised this was updated on the page in year 2014
Feb 21 08:33:07 <Psi-Jack>	linuxfan: I asked if it mentioned a PACKAGE, not a module.
Feb 21 08:34:14 <linuxfan>	@Psi-Jack oh ok, no it does not say package
Feb 21 08:34:24 <Psi-Jack>	Well, there's your answer then.
Feb 21 08:34:40 <edu4rdshl>	predicament, known issue
Feb 21 08:34:59 <predicament>	okay so just continue to skip or..?
Feb 21 08:35:16 <predicament>	or ignorepkg
Feb 21 08:35:19 <predicament>	or should we just remove it
Feb 21 08:36:08 <predicament>	like is it a known issue along with a solution in sight?
Feb 21 08:36:37 <predicament>	I'm curious
Feb 21 08:36:43 <edu4rdshl>	predicament, yes, the solution is to wait until rpm-sequoia goes to extra, or --ignore rpm-tools when updating
Feb 21 08:36:52 <edu4rdshl>	Or remove it, whatever you want
Feb 21 08:37:06 <linuxfan>	Psi-jack: sorry i am quite new to this, can you explain what i should do to get my card reader to work? i have a DVD drive as well, which i am assuming will give me same issues.
Feb 21 08:37:08 <predicament>	well thats what i was asking
Feb 21 08:37:10 <edu4rdshl>	That issue will be addressed on a few hours, pretty sure
Feb 21 08:37:35 <Psi-Jack>	linuxfan: Why would a DVD drive give you anything close to the "same issues?"
Feb 21 08:38:15 <predicament>	as long as it will be addressed then ill just continue to try until it works, and ill just skip it until then, i.e. ignore
Feb 21 08:38:52 <predicament>	but i need rpm-tools so
Feb 21 08:39:24 <linuxfan>	Psi-Jack: i meant it most likely will say module/driver or a package not installed, i am just assuming at this stage, i wanted to get the card reader working first, any advise on how i can do that?
Feb 21 08:40:30 <Psi-Jack>	linuxfan: That's a huge, and very random, assumption. But you're basically providing useless information about something literally dated in 2014, with no data. 
Feb 21 08:41:48 <linuxfan>	Psi-Jack: yeah, like i said i realised it later on, i was trying to get as much info possible on my own before putting out the question here.
Feb 21 08:41:58 <Psi-Jack>	Facts first.
Feb 21 08:43:29 <edu4rdshl>	predicament, or enable testing repos if you really wants it right now
Feb 21 08:44:27 <predicament>	it can wait
Feb 21 08:44:41 <predicament>	i dont need to be editing pacman.conf right now for that
Feb 21 08:46:45 <linuxfan>	Psi-Jack: so, can this be fixed? i mean installing the module?
Feb 21 08:46:56 <Psi-Jack>	linuxfan: Facts required.
Feb 21 08:55:58 <linuxfan>	Psi-Jack: ok, what do you need?
Feb 21 09:12:59 <jelle>	zbe: oh god, I moved it to extra
Feb 21 09:13:08 <rcf>	EVERYONE HATES YOU NOW 
Feb 21 09:13:20 <rcf>	Except not really jelle is <3. 
Feb 21 09:13:51 <rcf>	linuxfan: what is the ID for the device (from lsusb) 
Feb 21 09:13:55 <jelle>	[jelle@t14s][~]%pkgctl db move extra-staging extra libdnf libsolv rpm-tools
Feb 21 09:13:57 <jelle>	it's tooling fault!
Feb 21 09:16:41 <zbe>	jelle, 👍
Feb 21 09:16:56 <mpan>	Don’t blame computers! They only do what humans told them to do! ;)
Feb 21 09:17:15 <jelle>	:D
Feb 21 09:18:19 <rcf>	linuxfan: in addition to that, what have you done thus far, specifically. 
Feb 21 09:22:36 <linuxfan>	rcf: ID is 0bda:0129 i read through the bbs site and there is a solution to install a module, but this update is from 2014. i typed this on terminal modprobe rtsx_usb_mmc. rtsx_usb_mmc is the module that was suggested.
Feb 21 09:22:57 <linuxfan>	rcf: and i got this error - Module rtsx_usb_mmc not found in directory /lib/modules/6.7.5-arch1-1
Feb 21 09:24:44 <edu4rdshl>	There's rts5139-dkms fpr that
Feb 21 09:24:48 <edu4rdshl>	In the AUR
Feb 21 09:24:52 <rcf>	That's because it's been renamed to rtsx_usb_sdmmc
Feb 21 09:27:32 <rcf>	linuxfan: lsmod | grep rtsx, just in case it's already loaded and there's something else wrong. 
Feb 21 09:28:27 <edu4rdshl>	If the PCI id given is correct, then he needs the mentioned AUR package
Feb 21 09:29:05 <linuxfan>	rcf: rtsx is installed aready, based on lsmod | grep rtsx
Feb 21 09:29:31 <rcf>	linuxfan: what is the exact output 
Feb 21 09:30:24 <rcf>	edu4rdshl: it shouldn't be necessary; they've had mainline support for a while now in drivers/misc/cardreader/rtsx_usb.c 
Feb 21 09:30:35 <rcf>	That's why rts5139 was dropped from staging in the first place. 
Feb 21 09:31:34 <linuxfan>	rtsx_usb_ms    24576  0
Feb 21 09:31:35 <linuxfan>	memstick       28672  1 rtsx_usb_ms
Feb 21 09:31:35 <linuxfan>	rtsx_usb_sdmmc 40960  0

Feb 21 09:31:35 <linuxfan>	rtsx_usb       32768  2 rtsx_usb_sdmmc,rtsx_usb_ms
Feb 21 09:32:20 <rcf>	And what happens when you try to insert an SD card? Is there any journal output at all? 
Feb 21 09:32:38 <linuxfan>	rcf: the above is the output
Feb 21 09:32:54 <rcf>	Indeed, you have the right modules loaded. 
Feb 21 09:33:18 <linuxfan>	i haven't tried that, will try now
Feb 21 09:33:26 <rcf>	Wait what
Feb 21 09:33:37 <edu4rdshl>	lol
Feb 21 09:39:19 <linuxfan>	i inserted a SD card and nothing shows up in the /mnt directory on the root partition. in terminal as well nothing shows up when i do lsblk
Feb 21 09:40:27 <rcf>	What about in the journal?
Feb 21 09:40:57 <rcf>	Just have journalctl -lf running, and plug and unplug it to see what happens. 
Feb 21 09:44:46 <rcf>	Keep in mind it might take a few seconds to register as a block device 
Feb 21 09:44:51 <Strykar>	How do I troubleshoot some apps (wine, electron and QT so far) opening with a black window which I can only close on Gnome / Wayland?
Feb 21 09:45:10 <edu4rdshl>	Strykar, Nvidia + Wayland by change?
Feb 21 09:45:12 <edu4rdshl>	chance*
Feb 21 09:45:20 <rcf>	Strykar: try starting them in the terminal and see if they give any interesting output 
Feb 21 09:45:31 <rcf>	But yeah I think I know where this is going 
Feb 21 09:45:44 <Strykar>	edu4rdshl: yes
Feb 21 09:46:11 <edu4rdshl>	Strykar, https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/10624 a mesa bug is affecting all kind of apps running on X11

Feb 21 09:46:24 <edu4rdshl>	Try downgrading mesa and see if that fix the issue
Feb 21 09:46:40 <Strykar>	rcf: I did, the wine app appears to be starting after somed delay, but the window is black so I have no idea its loaded. Discord logs one line and exits.... I'll try that thanks
Feb 21 09:46:42 <edu4rdshl>	s/on X11/through X11/Xwayland/
Feb 21 09:47:09 *	rcf checks to see if they've decided who to blame, vulkan or mesa
Feb 21 09:47:20 <linuxfan>	rcf: there are no entries, i see only wifi entries, i tried with with the mouse dongle and another USB drive and both got registered
Feb 21 09:47:50 <Strykar>	edu4rdshl: downgrading just mesa will do or do I need to downgrade mesa-*?
Feb 21 09:48:13 <edu4rdshl>	Strykar, well, mesa and lib32-mesa
Feb 21 09:48:48 <Strykar>	23.x or 24.0.0 will do?
Feb 21 09:49:01 <rcf>	linuxfan: can you post the full journal for this boot?

Feb 21 09:50:52 <rcf>	Indeed.

Feb 21 10:51:14 <pulec>	hm gotta allow user_alow_other in fuse.conf, ok I guess
Feb 21 10:52:11 <predicament>	there it goes.  arch rebooted while playing a game.
Feb 21 10:52:20 <predicament>	oh well.
Feb 21 10:52:39 <predicament>	not arch rebooted, laptop rebooted.

Feb 21 10:53:49 <predicament>	doesnt say anything that i can tell
Feb 21 10:54:55 <predicament>	fuck.
Feb 21 10:55:11 <predicament>	hardwrae probably.
Feb 21 10:55:34 <predicament>	it happens often
Feb 21 10:55:53 <predicament>	its basically screwed. gonna attempt a warranty
Feb 21 10:56:03 <rcf>	Have you tried it on Windows 
Feb 21 10:56:44 <rcf>	Or with a memtest? Or something not-Linux?
Feb 21 10:56:53 <predicament>	i did to memtest
Feb 21 10:56:57 <predicament>	do*
Feb 21 10:57:01 <predicament>	nothing was wrong there
Feb 21 10:58:29 <predicament>	i will try it on windows, i did before any of this started happening and it was fine but it was fine on linux too
Feb 21 10:58:34 <predicament>	just randomly started happening
Feb 21 10:58:57 <predicament>	guess i have to try to install it, i swear to god, i dont have another drive to use and i dont have much space
Feb 21 10:59:59 <rcf>	If it’s too much you might try a warranty. I guess pick your poison.
Feb 21 11:00:35 <predicament>	its the only way to know if my hardwrae is fucked or not
Feb 21 11:00:55 <predicament>	so im gonna have to get a drive 
Feb 21 11:10:19 <linuxfan>	rcf: i messaged you the journal with few more details, hope you got it? i am using IRC clients after 20 years :-)
Feb 21 11:13:46 <predicament>	rcf also note that it doesnt happen all of the time, just someeitmes.  i womnder if its my GFX or the drive it has
Feb 21 11:14:00 <predicament>	has an nvme and those can crash sometimes.  could be that.
Feb 21 11:14:20 <predicament>	it doesnt just freeze up, like it reboots, goes black and then boom, rebootted.
Feb 21 11:14:51 <rcf>	predicament: GPU could be it if memtest is fine but games kill it 
Feb 21 11:15:11 <predicament>	thats what i was thinking.
Feb 21 11:16:37 <rcf>	linuxfan: indeed I did, unfortunately it’s not that useful. Is this a known-good SD card?
Feb 21 11:18:56 <linuxfan>	rcf: yes the card is good, its worked on my other laptop which also has a card reader inbuilt.
Feb 21 11:20:50 <edu4rdshl>	Strykar, no, the issue is on mesa
Feb 21 11:21:05 <edu4rdshl>	Strykar, and that doesn't work for electron apps :p
Feb 21 11:28:19 <predicament>	I cant find the docs to add something to grub.  i dont want tod o it with a usb

Feb 21 11:28:40 <predicament>	which has the same brand of ram
Feb 21 11:28:57 <predicament>	different nitro but it is a working nitro for sure
Feb 21 11:29:28 <predicament>	i cant seem to add it to grub
Feb 21 11:29:55 <predicament>	their stupid example is for ubuntu and debian
Feb 21 11:35:13 <predicament>	sigh let me keep looking
Feb 21 11:35:24 <predicament>	i've been trying to find a way to just add it to grub
Feb 21 11:36:17 <predicament>	i keep running into ubuntu instuctions
Feb 21 11:37:56 <predicament>	i downloaded memtest86+-efi
Feb 21 11:38:16 <predicament>	but i mean i dont know what else to fucking do, hold on
Feb 21 11:40:53 <Tom^>	i doubt its memory if it "reboots" freezing and random segfaults/corruptions i would buy
Feb 21 11:40:58 <mingdao>	predicament: What do you mean "add something to grub"?
Feb 21 11:41:14 <Tom^>	more of thermals/power issues or just general HW brokeness
Feb 21 11:41:20 <predicament>	in this case memtest
Feb 21 11:41:29 <predicament>	for this one
Feb 21 11:41:31 <predicament>	this laptop.
Feb 21 11:41:41 <predicament>	without a usb
Feb 21 11:41:50 <predicament>	did it from a USB before.  i just want to be able to use it
Feb 21 11:42:50 <predicament>	rpm-tools fixed though
Feb 21 11:43:33 <predicament>	Tom^
Feb 21 11:43:52 <predicament>	i just want to try it on another box, not the ont that is screwing up
Feb 21 11:43:56 <predicament>	its fine on there
Feb 21 11:44:32 <predicament>	it is separate from this issue which is why i didnt mention things
Feb 21 11:45:29 <predicament>	i had a USB to do that one and i want to just add it to grub.
Feb 21 11:46:46 <predicament>	and yes it has arch
Feb 21 11:47:08 <predicament>	i dont use anything but arch.

Feb 21 13:33:35 <virtualsid>	there is no 'tx rate' in the output of 'iw wlan0 link'
Feb 21 13:33:40 <teraflops>	hmm I have a mediatek one and I almost get gbit over wifi 
Feb 21 13:34:03 <virtualsid>	oh yeah, this card gets really high rates on windows, it's something to do with the linux driver, and I'm struggling to work out what to troubleshoot next.
Feb 21 13:34:12 <gloomy>	(To avoid XY problems: I'm trying to use Kooha and get this errors from dbus, `ScreenCast` interface is not available: https://gist.github.com/ldorigo/b1ce598132f0ef53fcfd045c02d969b2 )
Feb 21 13:34:24 <virtualsid>	(and how). I'm not convinced that forum post is the problem I have, but... maybe it is?
Feb 21 13:36:15 <gloomy>	oh, interesting arch just changed dbus broker, so now I have two problems instead of one :-) 
Feb 21 13:36:26 <virtualsid>	lol
Feb 21 13:36:32 <virtualsid>	good luck, gloomy :)
Feb 21 13:37:36 <astralc>	"just"
Feb 21 13:38:20 <mpan>	gloomy: Arch does not force dbus-broker. You can use the old, reference dbus.
Feb 21 13:39:54 <mpan>	And, given the old one is the reference implementation, it’s unlikely to become discouraged anytime soon.
Feb 21 13:40:41 <Foxboron>	mpan: this give the wrong impression though. The RFC intention is to replace dbus with dbus-broker
Feb 21 13:41:22 <Foxboron>	and that is what has been done. Sure you can change *back*, but there is some slight discouragement of the use here
Feb 21 13:41:30 <mpan>	Foxboron: but dbus will remain valid, no?
Feb 21 13:41:38 <Foxboron>	What does "valid" mean?
Feb 21 13:41:39 <mpan>	(other than particular libdbus dependencies)
Feb 21 13:41:49 <gloomy>	It's more "i don't want to invest time in understanding the old thing if there is a new thing that will be used instead"
Feb 21 13:41:50 <mpan>	That a system using dbus, not dbus-broker, will be expected to work fine.
Feb 21 13:42:12 <gloomy>	Not sure how much the broker changes to the end-user experience/interaction with dbus as a whole
Feb 21 13:42:14 <mpan>	Or, let me put it in other words: dbus will not become “we don’t support dbus here”.
Feb 21 13:42:15 <Foxboron>	mpan: I don't think we give any such guarantees regardless of package
Feb 21 13:43:21 <gloomy>	But anyway: assuming I'm still on the old dbus (if it's even relevant), is there a way to search pacman (un)installed packages to figure out which one is supposed to offer a given interface?
Feb 21 13:45:52 <Foxboron>	gloomy: you know the filename :)?
Feb 21 13:45:55 <Foxboron>	Use pacman -Fy
Feb 21 13:46:14 <mpan>	If it’s a dbus-activated service, it will have a file in “/usr/share/dbus-1/services/”.
Feb 21 13:50:20 <gloomy>	Foxboron: filename? of what? 
Feb 21 13:50:31 <Strykar>	edu4rdshl: set "ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT"? the config files won't work for discord which packs its own electron version righjt
Feb 21 13:51:36 <Strykar>	seems ancient: strings /opt/discord/Discord | grep '^Chrome/[0-9.]* Electron/[0-9]'  Chrome/108.0.5359.215 Electron/22.3.26
Feb 21 13:57:18 <gloomy>	Ok so the error I get is "No such interface “org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast” on object at path /org/freedesktop/portal/desktop"
Feb 21 13:58:04 <gloomy>	@mpan so, I assume the corresponding file is: /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop.service ? 
Feb 21 13:58:39 <gloomy>	The contents of the file are: /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop.service
Feb 21 13:58:42 <gloomy>	oops
Feb 21 13:58:59 <gloomy>	The contents of the file are: https://gist.github.com/ldorigo/d8b6ceb7016f31112404295e133222a2
Feb 21 13:59:39 <mpan>	No, “org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast.service”.
Feb 21 14:00:02 <mpan>	(I believe)
Feb 21 14:00:14 <gloomy>	So the service file should match the interface? 
Feb 21 14:00:27 <mpan>	Yes
Feb 21 14:00:44 <mpan>	Lemme check to be sure.
Feb 21 14:01:47 <gloomy>	https://i.imgur.com/sB6VwAP.png If I look at the interfaces on org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop, there is indeed no screencast: https://i.imgur.com/sB6VwAP.png
Feb 21 14:02:39 <gloomy>	Bit unsure how to proceed from here, still haven't fully understood the difference between xdg-desktop-portal and xdg-desktop-portal-kde and how they interact
Feb 21 14:03:55 <mpan>	https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-bus-starting-services
Feb 21 14:03:56 <phrik>	Title: D-Bus Specification (at dbus.freedesktop.org)
Feb 21 14:04:08 <mpan>	Though note that there was the *if* in what I said. An important if.
Feb 21 14:04:38 <gloomy>	Hmm, interesting, the `ScreenCast` interface does exist in *org.freedesktop.impl.portal.desktop.kde*  https://i.imgur.com/VCjsoCI.png
Feb 21 14:04:40 <mpan>	I don’t see anything in the repos providing the relevant service file.
Feb 21 14:05:22 <gloomy>	So now just need to find out 1. what's the difference between org.freedesktop.impl.portal.desktop.kde and org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop and 2. why kooha is calling the wrong one :D 
Feb 21 14:05:58 <mpan>	It requires an interface, not a particular object.
Feb 21 14:06:18 <gloomy>	mpan: indeed, I think the "service" here is just the desktop portal?
Feb 21 14:06:26 <gloomy>	(answering about yout "if")
Feb 21 14:06:33 <mpan>	The service, * I F *, is the service to be activated. IF
Feb 21 14:06:40 <mpan>	IF this is a dbus-activated service. IF
Feb 21 14:06:49 <gloomy>	> It requires an interface, not a particular object.
Feb 21 14:07:01 <gloomy>	Not sure what the dfference is, need to learn more about dbus
Feb 21 14:07:04 <mpan>	The program, which tries to use it, requires the interface.
Feb 21 14:07:20 <mpan>	Any object may provide that interface.
Feb 21 14:07:45 <mpan>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(object-oriented_programming)
Feb 21 14:07:46 <phrik>	Title: Interface (object-oriented programming) - Wikipedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
Feb 21 14:08:10 <mpan>	(minus the “classes” part, as it’s irrelevant here; objects do implement interfaces)
Feb 21 14:08:55 <gloomy>	Haha ok well I know interfaces/objects from oop, didn't know there was a 1-1 mapping her
Feb 21 14:08:59 <gloomy>	here*
Feb 21 14:10:25 <gloomy>	https://gist.github.com/ldorigo/ea88664140d1be4aa150b07741a057b0 This is the error from kooha. If the calling program only cares about an interface, why does it complain about the specific object (or, well, why does it try to use the interface on that specific object rather than the one that actually provides it)
Feb 21 14:12:41 <mpan>	Apparently it expects this interface, but the object doesn’t provide it.
Feb 21 14:14:03 <mpan>	gloomy: you do realize there was an if, and that if is not met, so what I said is completely irrelevant here?
Feb 21 14:14:47 <moldorcoder7>	hi is there a way to disable gnome-keyring , i remove all entries from /etc/xdg but disabling it from systemd is not possible as gnome-keyring.socket is always enabled 
Feb 21 14:14:53 <moldorcoder7>	i would like to start it manually
Feb 21 14:15:37 <Namarrgon>	disable it?
Feb 21 14:16:17 <gloomy>	yes yes there's two threads ongoing here - thread 1 is that if it was a dbus-activated *service* I would find the corresponding file in the directory you showed me, but now we established it isn't. thread 2 is me seeing that kooha expects an interface from the wrong object, and trying to figure out why
Feb 21 14:16:18 <Namarrgon>	why do you need to start it manually?
Feb 21 14:16:30 <gloomy>	Would be nice if IRC supported slack-like threads :-)
Feb 21 14:17:54 <mpan>	gloomy: more like the object is right, but it does not offer that particular interface.
Feb 21 14:18:21 <mpan>	gloomy: just that what I said will not help in identifying, what would provide that interfce.
Feb 21 14:19:19 <gloomy>	Clearly kooha expects org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop to provide the ScreenCast interface, but that interface is apparently provided (on my install) by org.freedesktop.impl.portal.desktop.kde. Big No-Prize to anyone who can tell me why :D
Feb 21 14:20:58 <gloomy>	ah, wait what's the difference in dbus between `org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop` and `/org/freedesktop/portal/Desktop`?
Feb 21 14:21:52 <moldorcoder7>	Namarrgon: because i had it started manually for years with --components=xxx,ssh and it just worked
Feb 21 14:22:23 <moldorcoder7>	no idea if i deleted the systemd unit files a while ago
Feb 21 14:23:00 <gloomy>	One is a "bus", the other is an "object path"? Because I have two busses (org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop and org.freedesktop.impl.portal.desktop.kde) who *both* have an object path `/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop`, except only the one in `org.freedesktop.impl.portal.desktop.kde` has the `ScreenCast` interface
Feb 21 14:23:23 <moldorcoder7>	systemd is starting it like this : /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --foreground --components=pkcs11,secrets --control-directory=/run/user/1000/keyring, without the ssh 
Feb 21 14:23:28 <Namarrgon>	moldorcoder7: does the daemon have no config file to configure these things?
Feb 21 14:24:10 <Namarrgon>	if not then override the service unit with your settings
Feb 21 14:25:08 <moldorcoder7>	for ssh not really, there is an entry to setup ssh with gcr here : https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Keyring, but it doesnt work for i3, and the wiki says : If you are using sway, i3, or any window manager that does not execute ....
Feb 21 14:25:33 <moldorcoder7>	but since recently , i3 does execute something apparently :)
Feb 21 14:28:08 <moldorcoder7>	i think the issue is coming from lightdm no pluging it all together at some level, will try to launch with another login manager once i can reboot
Feb 21 14:38:24 <predicament>	i just did my own research for the keyring crap, used GUI to fix it since i didn't have any time really
Feb 21 14:39:02 <predicament>	im not very knowledgable with the keyrings.  that stuff can confuse me sometimes.  not gonna lie to you guys.  and you guy probably are gonna laugh your asses off about that.
Feb 21 14:39:54 <predicament>	used seahorse and a method for cinnamon users
Feb 21 14:40:40 <predicament>	whenever i change the password it seems to want to use gnome keyring.
Feb 21 14:41:06 <predicament>	cinnamon is GTK, GTK is based off of gnome if i am not mistaken
Feb 21 14:41:22 <predicament>	so i suppose it makes sense.
Feb 21 14:42:04 <predicament>	i just make a new keyring, delete the old one from ~/.local/share/keyrings
Feb 21 14:42:43 <predicament>	could've done it command line too but seahorse was installed so why not just do that real quick.
Feb 21 14:53:13 <linuxfan>	hi. has anyone here installed only libreoffice-still-writer or calc package instead of the enter suite?
Feb 21 14:54:05 <astralc>	!anyone
Feb 21 14:54:05 <phrik>	Quite possibly. Why do you ask?
Feb 21 14:54:17 <Namarrgon>	arch doesn't split them up into separate packages
Feb 21 15:01:00 <predicament>	you can split them up yourself--you're free to download it from the website.. extract it and install that way https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/ you'll see the .tar.xz there available
Feb 21 15:01:03 <phrik>	Title: Download LibreOffice | LibreOffice - Free Office Suite - Based on OpenOffice - Compatible with Microsoft (at www.libreoffice.org)
Feb 21 15:01:25 <predicament>	you could even make your own package for it :P 
Feb 21 15:03:12 <predicament>	maybe use the flatpak
Feb 21 15:03:40 <predicament>	might be helpful, i dont know, it's an option.  im sorry, the *.tar.xz is source code, so you'd need to compile that
Feb 21 15:04:10 <Namarrgon>	does the flatpak option allow you to download the individual components of LO?
Feb 21 15:06:43 <predicament>	i was looking to see if it did, im not sure.  i dont think so, looking at the flatpak  at first i thought i saw something else.  doesn't look like it installs individually for arch.  i found an article for ubuntu though.

Feb 21 15:13:14 <predicament>	thought maybe some equivalent commands could get it going but nah
Feb 21 15:13:15 <predicament>	yeah
Feb 21 15:13:55 <predicament>	i know, you'd use debtap to try a .deb if i'm not mistake, or at least thats one way, maybe not the official way.  i will look up the officiall way.

Feb 21 15:14:30 <gromit>	predicament: its also okay to not answer questions if you're not familiar with the subject 
Feb 21 15:14:45 <losth1ghway>	hey there have program that is looking for libwraster6 -- it was previously working but is broken since a few updates.. pacman -F libwraster is turning up nothing. how can i manually install this lib?
Feb 21 15:14:51 <predicament>	i thought i was more familiar than i was, which is why i did some backpedaling, my bad.
Feb 21 15:15:47 <predicament>	-F losth1ghway?
Feb 21 15:16:01 <predicament>	is that a typo?
Feb 21 15:16:12 <astralc>	this bike doesn't have backpedal option, you are freely cruising into foot in mouth hill
Feb 21 15:16:26 <losth1ghway>	doesn't that look for files contained in packages?
Feb 21 15:16:36 <predicament>	OH
Feb 21 15:16:37 <astralc>	search files in package
Feb 21 15:16:40 <losth1ghway>	-Ss is also returning nothing
Feb 21 15:16:52 <predicament>	that's my fault lmao i completely forgot
Feb 21 15:17:04 <predicament>	sorry, strange day so far today.
Feb 21 15:17:08 <losth1ghway>	heh
Feb 21 15:17:15 <gromit>	losth1ghway: which package is looking for that? Is it something self-compiled? 
Feb 21 15:18:13 <losth1ghway>	gromit: it's a windowmaker weather forecast dockapp
Feb 21 15:18:20 <predicament>	im gonna look this up.

Feb 21 15:21:05 <losth1ghway>	this one specifically
Feb 21 15:21:08 <predicament>	are you compiling anything custom?
Feb 21 15:21:17 <predicament>	just asking to rule it out
Feb 21 15:21:22 <Namarrgon>	is it linked against libwraster6.so or libwraster.so.6?
Feb 21 15:21:39 <predicament>	yeah thats what i see here
Feb 21 15:22:38 <gromit>	losth1ghway: I also didn't find anything for libwraster
Feb 21 15:22:49 <predicament>	losth1ghway is it linked to libwraster6.so or libwraster.so.6?
Feb 21 15:22:58 <predicament>	against* not to.
Feb 21 15:23:08 <Namarrgon>	gromit: it's provided by windowmaker. i don#t know if it was ever split into a separate package.
Feb 21 15:23:30 <losth1ghway>	libwraster.so.6
Feb 21 15:23:50 <predicament>	it's linked against that?
Feb 21 15:23:51 <Namarrgon>	pacman -Q windowmaker
Feb 21 15:23:59 <predicament>	^
Feb 21 15:24:03 <gromit>	Namarrgon: ahh, an AUR package 
Feb 21 15:24:18 <predicament>	yep.
Feb 21 15:24:37 <losth1ghway>	??
Feb 21 15:24:47 <Namarrgon>	how did you install wmforecast?
Feb 21 15:24:59 <predicament>	yeah what was the method you used, step by step if possible
Feb 21 15:25:06 <predicament>	if you can remember anyway
Feb 21 15:25:12 <losth1ghway>	compiled i think, was years ago
Feb 21 15:25:18 <Namarrgon>	manually?
Feb 21 15:25:20 <losth1ghway>	yeah
Feb 21 15:25:30 <Namarrgon>	do you still have windowmaker installed?
Feb 21 15:25:36 <predicament>	is it installed
Feb 21 15:25:38 <predicament>	oops
Feb 21 15:25:41 <losth1ghway>	yep
Feb 21 15:25:46 <Namarrgon>	how did you install that?
Feb 21 15:26:34 <losth1ghway>	maybe it was just pacman actually, since pacman -Q does show it
Feb 21 15:26:43 <predicament>	does it?
Feb 21 15:26:50 <predicament>	well
Feb 21 15:27:12 <predicament>	is it installed twice?
Feb 21 15:27:19 <losth1ghway>	how to check?
Feb 21 15:27:32 <predicament>	well one would be with the package, which you said is installed
Feb 21 15:27:40 <predicament>	and then you could have compiled and installed manually
Feb 21 15:27:46 <predicament>	but it was so long ago as you said
Feb 21 15:27:52 <predicament>	im just wondering if you did that as well
Feb 21 15:28:10 <predicament>	if you can remember anyway
Feb 21 15:28:13 <predicament>	that's what they're asking
Feb 21 15:29:25 <predicament>	now how youd check is taking a look at what you compiled and seeing what happens once you're done compling--maybe dont clean it
Feb 21 15:30:02 <predicament>	and dont make install either
Feb 21 15:30:14 <predicament>	so to speak, if it is a make file.
Feb 21 15:30:56 <predicament>	take a look at the make file, see where it is supposed to go
Feb 21 15:31:22 <predicament>	and then check in that direcory.  if it's not there, then you didn't double install it, more than likely.

Feb 21 15:34:32 <ldiamond>	Maybe he didn't paste and he just types very fast.
Feb 21 15:35:45 <predicament>	heh.
Feb 21 15:36:07 <alad>	it's funny because predicament's monologue is still longer than that guy's terminal dump
Feb 21 15:36:20 <ldiamond>	:P
Feb 21 15:36:23 <predicament>	lol
Feb 21 15:36:36 <predicament>	lmao
Feb 21 15:37:47 <predicament>	gushers are awesome :)
Feb 21 15:38:22 <gromit>	losth1ghway: welcome back! 
Feb 21 15:38:24 <gromit>	!give losth1ghway paste

Feb 21 15:38:46 <predicament>	oh i see what give does
Feb 21 15:39:26 <predicament>	im used to just doing ! paste (yes i typo'd that so it couldnt flood the room lol)
Feb 21 15:39:47 <losth1ghway>	sorry for forgetting to use paste! in the meantime i figured out i actually do have libwraster.so.6.1.0 installed and its symlinked to libwraster.so.6
Feb 21 15:40:19 <predicament>	i was going to wait for someone to ask about that
Feb 21 15:40:45 <predicament>	so you have that and its linked to that.so.6
Feb 21 15:40:52 <losth1ghway>	yup
Feb 21 15:41:22 <ldiamond>	That's the correct setup
Feb 21 15:41:31 <predicament>	^ okay i thought so
Feb 21 15:41:38 <predicament>	i wantedt o make sure
Feb 21 15:41:45 <predicament>	so i let someone else answer :P
Feb 21 15:41:47 <gromit>	predicament: could you turn down your verbosity please? 
Feb 21 15:41:52 <predicament>	yes.
Feb 21 15:44:48 <ldiamond>	losth1ghway: What's the actual error?
Feb 21 15:45:06 <rav>	wth is linux-firmware-whence needed for...?
Feb 21 15:45:16 <losth1ghway>	wmforecast: /usr/lib/libwraster.so.6: version `LIBWRASTER6' not found (required by wmforecast)
Feb 21 15:46:06 <Scimmia>	half an hour to get to the actual error, and it wasn't what they were asking about. Impressive
Feb 21 15:46:09 <ldiamond>	rav: isn't that licensing stuff?
Feb 21 15:46:31 <Namarrgon>	losth1ghway: rebuild the thing
Feb 21 15:46:45 <Namarrgon>	write a PKGBUILD, ideally
Feb 21 15:47:35 <rav>	ldiamond: seems so
Feb 21 15:51:15 <losth1ghway>	thx Namarrgon, rebuild fixed it
Feb 21 15:51:27 <losth1ghway>	what exactly went wrong here?
Feb 21 15:52:14 <ldiamond>	It was built against another version of the lib.
Feb 21 15:53:39 <Scimmia>	it appears upstream removed symbol versioning
Feb 21 15:53:42 <losth1ghway>	shouldn't the ln from libwraster.so.6 to libwraster.so.6.1.0 have worked tho?
Feb 21 15:53:55 <Namarrgon>	don't symlink libraries
Feb 21 15:54:15 <Scimmia>	It's not about the soname or the anything like that
Feb 21 15:54:17 <ldiamond>	That symlink is likely Arch's. You'd symlink major versions to actual minor versions.
Feb 21 15:54:29 <ldiamond>	It's defining the version in the lib
Feb 21 15:54:29 <losth1ghway>	yeah i didnt do the symlink
Feb 21 15:54:31 <Namarrgon>	the abi changed and you forgot to rebuild your unofficial stuff
Feb 21 15:54:32 <ldiamond>	no longer matched
Feb 21 15:54:43 <Scimmia>	or rather you symlink the soname to the actual lib
Feb 21 15:54:46 <losth1ghway>	ok that makes sense
Feb 21 15:55:01 <losth1ghway>	thanks for the help everyone
Feb 21 15:55:23 <Scimmia>	ldiamond: the soname defines the version of the lib and that wasn't the problem here
Feb 21 15:56:56 <Scimmia>	ldiamond: see https://man7.org/conf/lca2006/shared_libraries/slide19a.html#:~:text=Allows%20a%20single%20library%20to,time%20of%20the%20static%20link.

Feb 21 15:58:40 <predicament>	31% for memtest86+
Feb 21 16:00:37 <predicament>	which temps for ram are too high?  like a range would be helpful, there's way too much info online saying so many different things
Feb 21 16:00:45 <predicament>	laptop ram
Feb 21 16:01:07 <predicament>	5600.
Feb 21 16:01:45 <predicament>	i trust you guys more than I do most crap on the internet.

Feb 21 16:05:03 <predicament>	alright i guess i'll shut up.  it's 82C atm.  was 79 and now 82C while running memtest86+ v7.00.
Feb 21 16:05:23 <predicament>	it failed
Feb 21 16:06:20 <GNUtoo>	Hi, Arch Linux has reproducible builds (https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/archlinux/archlinux.html) and that requires at least 2 builders. I tried to find the code that does the automatic build of packages but I didn't find it. Is it published somewhere? I'm looking for something that could automatize the building of PKGBUILDs at a large scale for a downstream distribution of Arch Linux.
Feb 21 16:06:33 <predicament>	ill let it finish.  i'm done.
Feb 21 16:06:57 <gromit>	GNUtoo: https://github.com/archlinux/archlinux-repro
Feb 21 16:07:03 <GNUtoo>	Thanks
Feb 21 16:07:06 <losth1ghway>	thx Namarrgon
Feb 21 16:09:20 <gromit>	GNUtoo: also https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/rebuilderd-website https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rebuilderd and https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/infrastructure/-/tree/master/roles/rebuilderd?ref_type=heads & https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/infrastructure/-/tree/master/roles/rebuilderd_worker?ref_type=heads
Feb 21 16:09:21 <phrik>	Title: Arch Linux / Rebuilderd Website · GitLab (at gitlab.archlinux.org)
Feb 21 16:09:34 <gromit>	GNUtoo: why are you interested? :) 
Feb 21 16:10:46 <GNUtoo>	gromit: one day I'd like to have more automatic builds in Parabola, right now developers build packages and upload them by hand from their machines, so making a git hook that builds packages is probably not that hard, but taking into account dependencies is harder.
Feb 21 16:11:27 <GNUtoo>	Since reproducible builds are automatized, there should be a way to do that somehow.
Feb 21 16:12:38 <jelle>	it's a bit of a different problem however
Feb 21 16:12:51 <GNUtoo>	I probably mess up asking the question indeed.
Feb 21 16:12:55 <jelle>	nope
Feb 21 16:13:00 <jelle>	I understood it :)
Feb 21 16:13:13 <jelle>	rebuilderd is a scheduler and uses the exact packages used during building to rebuild the package
Feb 21 16:13:26 <jelle>	so it doesn't do anything for automatic building with regard of rebuild order
Feb 21 16:13:27 <gromit>	jelle: its the same for Arch, packager build & push from their local machines, optionally build on the (beefy) buildserver
Feb 21 16:13:39 <gromit>	wops, meant to tag GNUtoo 
Feb 21 16:13:53 <GNUtoo>	ohh ok
Feb 21 16:14:52 *	GNUtoo should probably ask archlinuxarm then as they seem to have some automatic build system in place
Feb 21 16:14:53 <gromit>	GNUtoo: reproducible builds are just a mechanic of external verification to ensure that theres nothing sneakily added to the binary package 
Feb 21 16:15:16 <jelle>	GNUtoo: alarm's one is a mess and they can't keep up so not sure but yeah feel free :)
Feb 21 16:15:31 <GNUtoo>	Yes I'm aware of what is reproducible builds (and their limitations as well).
Feb 21 16:17:17 <GNUtoo>	For the reference they have "Custom PKGBUILD variables" like "noautobuild" (https://github.com/archlinuxarm/PKGBUILDs) so they probably have something, so I'll ask them later on about it. Thanks a lot for all the information.
Feb 21 16:17:37 <jelle>	oh god
Feb 21 16:17:48 <jelle>	GNUtoo: yes, they have an automatic rebuild thingy iirc
Feb 21 16:18:00 <Foxboron>	Which is not open-source
Feb 21 16:18:03 <Foxboron>	it's all private scripts
Feb 21 16:18:11 <GNUtoo>	ok
Feb 21 16:18:36 <Foxboron>	GNUtoo: Arch doesn't have any build infra for their either fwiw
Feb 21 16:18:47 <Foxboron>	archlinux32 has scripts to build 32bit and afaik that is it?
Feb 21 16:19:26 <GNUtoo>	ok, I'll look, thanks.
Feb 21 16:19:41 <gromit>	GNUtoo: this might be interesting tho https://somegit.dev/ALHP/ALHP.GO

Feb 21 16:21:26 <GNUtoo>	Nice, thanks a lot
Feb 21 16:22:43 <linuxfan>	Been away for a long time, thank you for the advice on libreoffice package.
Feb 21 16:26:16 <predicament>	7,250 errors in memtest86+.  "FAIL" lol.  across the screen
Feb 21 16:26:31 <mefistofeles>	not good
Feb 21 16:26:48 <predicament>	yeah im gonna put my original ram in, see what happens.
Feb 21 16:26:57 <predicament>	if it's the ram hopefully i can return it.
Feb 21 16:27:08 <predicament>	it explains why it's been rebooting when i play games.
Feb 21 16:34:50 <aminvakil>	arojas: does all packages which depend on qt6-base, should be rebuilt after qt6-base bump? i'm talking specifically about qbittorrent which has not been rebuilt after qt6-base version bump, although i haven't seen any issue with its basic performance except from its logo in tray :)
Feb 21 16:35:17 <linuxfan>	predicament: what is the memtest for? just to check on the RAM hardware? 
Feb 21 16:36:07 <arojas>	aminvakil: no, only the ones that use private API. 6.6.2 was an exception as it had an unexpected ABI break
Feb 21 16:37:11 <predicament>	to see why my box reboots whenever i play a game 
Feb 21 16:37:32 <predicament>	and it failed miserably obviously., so now i just put back the original ram it came with
Feb 21 16:37:35 <predicament>	and im testing it again
Feb 21 16:37:47 <aminvakil>	arojas: gotcha, then i don't should investigate more myself why its tray logo has been changed to something else (i think this was an older logo)

Feb 21 16:47:13 <predicament>	if i can get the temps down and it would stop errors from popping up?  i'd absolutely do that
Feb 21 16:47:32 <predicament>	and maybe not buy the same ram too :P
Feb 21 16:48:14 <predicament>	alright well i guess no one's gonna say anything about that, so.  looks like the ram it came with passed in memtest86+
Feb 21 16:48:29 <jelle>	you are out of warranty?
Feb 21 16:49:04 <predicament>	regarding the laptop no, regarding the ram i bought on amazon to upgrade, i do not know about that.  let me look.
Feb 21 16:49:37 <jelle>	well it's the ram you bought what fails so return it?
Feb 21 16:49:49 <kevr>	if you purchased them <= 30 days ago, you should be able to just RMA it
Feb 21 16:49:57 <predicament>	return window closed, i didnt want to type more stuff is all heh
Feb 21 16:50:07 <kevr>	rip
Feb 21 16:50:09 <predicament>	yep
Feb 21 16:50:14 <predicament>	cant do anything about it
Feb 21 16:50:18 <kevr>	still like jelle said, check the warranty
Feb 21 16:50:31 <predicament>	i am
Feb 21 16:50:31 <kevr>	a lot of manufacts have factory defect warranties for like a year for free
Feb 21 16:51:21 <jelle>	predicament: you bought it this year?
Feb 21 16:51:51 <predicament>	i bought it dec 23
Feb 21 16:51:53 <predicament>	2023
Feb 21 16:55:15 <predicament>	i dont see anything about a warranty.. it just comes in a little plastic box, i have to talk to customer service and make a request for the manufacturer warranty since it's "Crucial" -- that's what it says for "Warranty"
Feb 21 16:55:31 <predicament>	"Manufacturer’s warranty can be requested from customer service. Click here to make a request to customer service."
Feb 21 16:55:49 <predicament>	I'll do that when im home from work
Feb 21 16:57:22 <predicament>	at least the other ram passed so it isnt the slots
Feb 21 17:10:43 <Aryan>	why can't I edit my user-1000.slice?
Feb 21 17:10:45 <Aryan>	aryan@Archian:~$ systemctl edit user-1000.slice
Feb 21 17:10:45 <Aryan>	Run 'systemctl edit --force --full user-1000.slice' to create a new unit.
Feb 21 17:11:07 <Aryan>	I mean create drop-in files.
Feb 21 17:18:39 <predicament>	this has CL46 anyway.
Feb 21 17:20:07 <predicament>	i'll try some kingston CL40 witht he same speed.  64GB kit.  if this crucial has a warranty i will use it.  but im doubting i'll get to anytime soon, its only 200 bucks.  so there's my rationalization.
Feb 21 17:20:34 <predicament>	and im gonna cool down the ram
Feb 21 17:21:08 <jelle>	https://www.crucial.com/company/warranty it's life time warranty anyway
Feb 21 17:21:10 <phrik>	Title: Crucial Warranty Information | Crucial.com (at www.crucial.com)
Feb 21 17:21:17 <jelle>	except for predicament: * Limited lifetime warranty is limited to 10 years from purchase in Austria, Belgium, France and Germany.
Feb 21 17:21:33 <predicament>	i see
Feb 21 17:21:36 <predicament>	thank you for that
Feb 21 17:21:52 <predicament>	I appreciate it.
Feb 21 17:24:21 <mpan>	Aryan: there is no user-1000.slice. It’s user-.slice, which is shared among all users. And to edit it for all users, you use `sudo systemctl edit user.slice` (note no ‘-’), or you **create** a drop-in for the dynamically named user-UID.slice.
Feb 21 17:24:42 <mpan>	Aryan: see `man user@.service` for details.
Feb 21 17:39:27 <demonicmaniac1>	predicament: for intel cpus that's normal - they go up to 110 C
Feb 21 17:39:51 <predicament>	ryzen 9 7940S
Feb 21 17:39:52 <demonicmaniac1>	yes not kidding, intel since at least 8th gen has gone above 90C during load and 110C on recent models of 12th+
Feb 21 17:40:04 <predicament>	thats high though.
Feb 21 17:40:05 <demonicmaniac1>	ah. then < 90C is fine
Feb 21 17:40:16 <demonicmaniac1>	they're designed that way
Feb 21 17:40:17 <predicament>	it was approaching 90
Feb 21 17:40:23 <predicament>	88C
Feb 21 17:40:31 <predicament>	but i can put heatspreaders on it
Feb 21 17:40:40 <demonicmaniac1>	it's 100C for the 7940hs
Feb 21 17:41:04 <predicament>	oh okay
Feb 21 17:41:07 <demonicmaniac1>	they will just stop turboing sub 90C or rather reduce the turbo above base when going over 9)C
Feb 21 17:41:11 <demonicmaniac1>	*90C
Feb 21 17:41:31 <predicament>	well it was hitting 88 during memtest86+ v7
Feb 21 17:41:47 <demonicmaniac1>	and yeah definitely check other sticks in the slots to see if it's the slots or the memory
Feb 21 17:41:57 <demonicmaniac1>	or the sticks in another machine if possible
Feb 21 17:42:03 <predicament>	i put the original memory back in both slots.
Feb 21 17:42:09 <predicament>	passed with flying colors.
Feb 21 17:42:16 <predicament>	16GB total though
Feb 21 17:42:21 <predicament>	and the temps were way lower
Feb 21 17:42:23 <demonicmaniac1>	ah that's good then 
Feb 21 17:42:25 <predicament>	below 80
Feb 21 17:42:57 <predicament>	70-75, never went over that.  probably would have gotten to 80 at some point if it was 64GB
Feb 21 17:43:40 <demonicmaniac1>	makes sense if it's slower memory
Feb 21 17:43:52 <predicament>	5600 MT/s
Feb 21 17:43:54 <predicament>	same speed
Feb 21 17:43:59 <demonicmaniac1>	hm then it doesn't
Feb 21 17:44:13 <predicament>	original ram has heatspreaders on them
Feb 21 17:44:18 <predicament>	thats why
Feb 21 17:44:51 <predicament>	the failing ram was not
Feb 21 17:45:11 <predicament>	did not have heatspreaders*
Feb 21 18:19:30 <edu4rdshl>	Strykar, no, just add --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform,WaylandWindowDecorations --ozone-platform=wayland to the launch options (via the .desktop file, for example)
Feb 21 18:20:03 <edu4rdshl>	That will work for all the electron apps, unless the electron version has broken wayland support (beiong too old)
Feb 21 18:50:55 <B-|>	why is the qemu article so annoyingly difficult to read?
Feb 21 18:51:33 <B-|>	i just need x86 emulation with kvm. it seems i just need qemu-desktop, right?
Feb 21 18:51:39 <predicament>	still a lot of flickering during gameplay
Feb 21 18:51:49 <B-|>	:: There are 3 providers available for qemu:
Feb 21 18:51:49 <B-|>	:: Repository extra 1) qemu-base  2) qemu-desktop  3) qemu-full
Feb 21 18:52:24 <B-|>	article should just say run "pacman -S qemu" then explain what each of these are, no?
Feb 21 18:52:24 <predicament>	um
Feb 21 18:52:27 <B-|>	it's a word salad
Feb 21 18:52:43 <predicament>	i'd do full, thats juts me
Feb 21 18:52:45 <predicament>	just*
Feb 21 18:52:46 <tirnanog>	it does explain.
Feb 21 18:52:53 <demure>	well, it's a wiki, so you could improve the page
Feb 21 18:52:59 <predicament>	it explains
Feb 21 18:53:13 <tirnanog>	full offers usermode emulation which - judging by your tone - you probably aren't interested in.
Feb 21 18:53:26 <hmw[at]>	I installed a package group (java-runtime) and now I want to uninstall everything it brought in. https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Meta_package_and_package_group says I should just -R <group name> but that only removes that one package, while 3 more remain. I guess I am missing something?
Feb 21 18:53:27 <phrik>	Title: Meta package and package group - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Feb 21 18:53:47 <predicament>	... no
Feb 21 18:54:09 <predicament>	what the.  hang on
Feb 21 18:54:41 <hmw[at]>	Argh. -Rs I suppose *feels dumb*
Feb 21 18:54:42 <astralc>	hmw[at]: do pacman -Rs <group>, to remove the installed dependencies
Feb 21 18:54:46 <B-|>	tirnanog: where does it say that exactly?
Feb 21 18:54:47 <predicament>	-Rs
Feb 21 18:54:51 <hmw[at]>	astralc: Thanks :)
Feb 21 18:55:01 <B-|>	i don't think it doesn't and it hasn't for years now
Feb 21 18:55:16 <B-|>	(just saying, not blaming anyone)
Feb 21 18:55:19 <predicament>	there astralc gave a better answer
Feb 21 18:56:38 <tirnanog>	B-|: usermode emulation is described in section 1.1. it goes on to talk about qemu-emulators-full as providing usermode emulation. if you pacman -Si qemu-full, you'll see that it pulls in qemu-emulators-full.
Feb 21 18:56:47 <tirnanog>	I agree that you probably want qemu-desktop.
Feb 21 18:56:57 <Strykar>	edu4rdshl: I added them, but I do not see them in the invoked Discord command
Feb 21 18:57:40 <tirnanog>	maybe even something likevirt-manager on top of that, depending on your tastes.
Feb 21 18:57:45 <B-|>	judjing by the genuine headache i feel from trying to read this article. it needs clarification. i hope i won't make it worse
Feb 21 18:58:04 <predicament>	libvirt-mnager is what i'd be using, likevirt..?  never heard of that
Feb 21 18:58:08 <tirnanog>	if you don't know what usermode emulation is, I don't think you should rushing in to edit the article.
Feb 21 18:58:43 <tirnanog>	especially when it's explained almost immediately from the outset.
Feb 21 18:58:51 <predicament>	wait thats not the package name.  still never heard of likevirt before
Feb 21 18:58:54 <MacGyver>	predicament: I think they just missed a space ;)
Feb 21 18:58:59 <MacGyver>	predicament: "like virt-manager"
Feb 21 18:59:02 <predicament>	oh lmao
Feb 21 18:59:25 <tirnanog>	yeah. my space bar is wonky :(
Feb 21 18:59:27 <predicament>	like i did, and a typo.  i didnt correct mine because it becomes a monologue :P
Feb 21 18:59:32 <predicament>	so is mine, i hear ya.
Feb 21 19:00:21 <Vorpal>	I'm writing my own tool targeting working with pacman/alpm data (basically a faster replacement for paccheck). I have some very specific and unusual questions about precise semantics of certain fields in the package database (specifically the "backup" field). Where could I get answers to that?
Feb 21 19:00:45 <Vorpal>	I have read the man page for pacman etc and not found the answers I seek
Feb 21 19:01:52 <predicament>	anyone?  i dontt hink i can answer this one
Feb 21 19:01:54 <Vorpal>	One question is: can only *regular* files be marked backed up config files? What about symlinks, fifos etc?
Feb 21 19:02:51 <Vorpal>	(I suppose that "symlinks" would be the only one with sensible semantics and that also sometimes exist in /etc)
Feb 21 19:02:54 <predicament>	?  yeah im confused as to what you're really asking
Feb 21 19:03:56 <predicament>	and symlinks are all over the place
Feb 21 19:04:02 <Vorpal>	predicament: so: in PKGBUILDs you can mark certain files as backup. This is what makes pacman save a .pacnew file when upgrading and you change the config file. I'm asking, can it also be applied to symlinks or just regular files? As pacman(8) talks about comparing md5sums I don't see how it could work.
Feb 21 19:04:25 <Vorpal>	maybe it would hash the target path of the symlink?
Feb 21 19:04:30 <predicament>	yeah i dont know if i could answer that
Feb 21 19:04:37 <predicament>	thats a great job of clarifying it actually
Feb 21 19:04:54 <predicament>	somebody will answer you soon im pretty sure
Feb 21 19:05:11 <brjl>	You mean to symlink the .new file?
Feb 21 19:05:43 <predicament>	that's what im thinking they mean
Feb 21 19:05:52 <Vorpal>	brjl: I mean: a package installs a symlink (/etc/somedir/mysymlink). It adds /etc/somedir/mysymlink to the backup array in the PKGBUILD. What happens?
Feb 21 19:06:16 <Vorpal>	Is that even legal?
Feb 21 19:06:22 <brjl>	heh that's a very good question
Feb 21 19:06:36 <predicament>	its got me stumped, amazing question actually
Feb 21 19:07:03 <brjl>	I don't think it is. But I also don't think there are *no* packages that do such thing. So I'd recommend you find one that does what you say.
Feb 21 19:07:06 <Vorpal>	"HANDLING CONFIG FILES" in pacman(8) is no help. Because it talks about md5sums. What does that mean for symlinks?
Feb 21 19:07:08 <brjl>	But then that's a whole new problem
Feb 21 19:07:33 <predicament>	oh boy
Feb 21 19:08:01 <Vorpal>	brjl: I could create a dummy package that does this I guess. Or I could go read libalpm source code (eeh, no thanks). But that doesn't answer what the intended behaviour is, just "what happens"
Feb 21 19:08:26 <predicament>	do the dummy package, dont fuck with libalpm until you absolutely "have to"
Feb 21 19:08:28 <predicament>	so to speak
Feb 21 19:08:29 <brjl>	I'm pretty sure md5sum would target the file being linked, and not the symlink itself. But that's straight up conjecture
Feb 21 19:08:58 <predicament>	if you are able to test it separately with a dummy pkg, do that
Feb 21 19:09:01 <predicament>	see what happens
Feb 21 19:09:21 <Vorpal>	brjl: the *sensible* behaviour would arguably be to do an md5sum of the symlink target path.
Feb 21 19:09:40 <predicament>	and do the sum of he sym
Feb 21 19:09:54 <edu4rdshl>	Strykar, make sure to kill all the process of Discord before (Discord tends to "minimize on close or go to tray when you close it)
Feb 21 19:10:19 <predicament>	i could've helped with discord
Feb 21 19:10:21 <predicament>	:P
Feb 21 19:10:28 <Vorpal>	Since I'm implementing my own parser for /var/lib/pacman (yes this is probably stupid, but libalpm doesn't like being multi-threaded, besides I need to for the mtree files anyway as libalpm doesn't expose the checksums) I end up asking all sorts of weird questions.
Feb 21 19:10:48 <predicament>	no these are great questions
Feb 21 19:10:59 <predicament>	most people just go and fuck their installation up
Feb 21 19:11:04 *	predicament looks around and hides
Feb 21 19:11:16 <Vorpal>	predicament: I'm between number of cores and number of hyperthreading threads times faster than paccheck by the way :D
Feb 21 19:11:29 <predicament>	lol.
Feb 21 19:11:38 <predicament>	well thats quick
Feb 21 19:11:56 <predicament>	it'll be faster
Feb 21 19:12:06 <brjl>	godspeed
Feb 21 19:12:08 <predicament>	lol
Feb 21 19:12:09 <Vorpal>	I plan on cleaning up the code and then publishing to crates.io later this week. 
Feb 21 19:12:20 <predicament>	nice
Feb 21 19:12:22 <predicament>	:)
Feb 21 19:12:40 <predicament>	you're pretty cool.
Feb 21 19:12:41 <Tom^>	Vorpal: is it rust?
Feb 21 19:12:42 <Vorpal>	brjl: you probably could with io-uring. I'm not going down that rabit hole. But directory traversal and IO are the main bottlenecks
Feb 21 19:12:46 <Vorpal>	Tom^: yes
Feb 21 19:12:50 <predicament>	its rust
Feb 21 19:12:54 <predicament>	of course
Feb 21 19:13:08 <brjl>	Can there be anything else besides Rust in crates.io?
Feb 21 19:13:12 <predicament>	lol
Feb 21 19:13:19 <predicament>	thats why i am laughing a bit
Feb 21 19:13:23 <Tom^>	never heard of crates.io before so *shrug*
Feb 21 19:13:30 <brjl>	fair
Feb 21 19:13:32 <Tom^>	sounded like some flatpack shenanigans xD
Feb 21 19:13:35 <predicament>	yeah its rust
Feb 21 19:13:39 <predicament>	:P
Feb 21 19:13:45 <Vorpal>	brjl: not intended, but I mean, you could upload a data file in your crate. That data file could actually be a js file
Feb 21 19:13:52 <Vorpal>	So yes technically, usefully? no
Feb 21 19:13:57 <predicament>	and its used with javascript someimes
Feb 21 19:14:14 <predicament>	and you verified that for me
Feb 21 19:14:27 <Vorpal>	pretty sure npm has non-js stuff on it though (that are meant to somehow work with js)
Feb 21 19:14:33 <predicament>	of course
Feb 21 19:14:42 <predicament>	it's node, not just javascript
Feb 21 19:14:57 <Vorpal>	pyo3 probably has some python files in it's crate on crates.io
Feb 21 19:15:16 <predicament>	python v3 .. mabe
Feb 21 19:15:18 <predicament>	maybe*
Feb 21 19:15:29 <Tom^>	Vorpal: do you use an IDE or just an text editor for your rust? kinda used to qtcreator but was thinking of checking out what rust is all about a few days ago
Feb 21 19:16:47 <Vorpal>	Vscode with rust-analyzer plugin. Though you can use rust-analyzer with anything that supports LSP, so emacs, neovim etc.
Feb 21 19:17:02 <Vorpal>	no idea about qtcreator, haven't used it for a few years now
Feb 21 19:17:13 <Tom^>	yeah i think it does LSP hm interesting
Feb 21 19:17:28 <predicament>	i use vscode.
Feb 21 19:17:59 <Vorpal>	time to create that dummy package...
Feb 21 19:18:30 <predicament>	alright
Feb 21 19:18:35 <edu4rdshl>	Is anyone here using Gnome 46 beta? If so, what has been the experience so far?
Feb 21 19:18:53 <predicament>	ot me
Feb 21 19:19:00 <predicament>	not*
Feb 21 19:19:10 <predicament>	i might try
Feb 21 19:19:59 <predicament>	if you're still curious in a few hours and you haven't bothered or got other testimonitals so to speak, then  thats all lol
Feb 21 19:20:17 <demonicmaniac1>	Tom^: you-completeme is really the only plugin you need and vim :)
Feb 21 19:20:30 <Tom^>	demonicmaniac1: im to old for cli nowadays
Feb 21 19:20:33 <Tom^>	:D
Feb 21 19:20:42 <demonicmaniac1>	gvim exists
Feb 21 19:20:48 <Tom^>	meh its just wrapped cli
Feb 21 19:20:56 <Vorpal>	predicament, brjl: okay that was interesting! it does do something A symlink to something that doesn't exist always gets a .pacnew, even if unchanged
Feb 21 19:21:11 <Vorpal>	now to test changing symlinks and see how it works I guess
Feb 21 19:21:36 <predicament>	thats... interesting heh
Feb 21 19:23:02 <predicament>	im ehausted
Feb 21 19:23:07 <predicament>	+x
Feb 21 19:24:16 <Vorpal>	yeah this is really confusing actually. For symlinks to existing files it... I'm not sure what it does actually
Feb 21 19:24:32 <Vorpal>	I think that maybe it captures checksums from the package build environment?
Feb 21 19:24:38 <Vorpal>	of the target files?
Feb 21 19:25:28 <brjl>	Oh that's funny
Feb 21 19:25:32 <Vorpal>	no that makes no sense, because that isn't stored in the package
Feb 21 19:25:37 <Vorpal>	so it is something else going on
Feb 21 19:26:44 <Vorpal>	No, at install time
Feb 21 19:27:02 <Vorpal>	it is the target file content at install time.
Feb 21 19:27:32 <Vorpal>	thanks for using plaintext files in the package database though, makes it easier to debug this
Feb 21 19:27:39 <Vorpal>	I wonder if it worth filing a bug about this
Feb 21 19:27:52 <Vorpal>	as a "error on this situation instead" bug
Feb 21 19:29:03 <Strykar>	edu4rdshl: mine doesn't and I had checked with pgrep 
Feb 21 19:29:17 *	Strykar reboots just to be sure
Feb 21 19:30:05 <susi>	double reboot is even more firm 
Feb 21 19:33:22 <brjl>	poweroff, run off PSU, remove from wall
Feb 21 19:33:39 <brjl>	plug back into wall, turn on PSU, turn on PC
Feb 21 19:36:49 <Vorpal>	Now I wonder what happens with other exotic files....
Feb 21 19:37:00 <Vorpal>	Could I make pacman hang if I put in a fifo or unix socket
Feb 21 19:37:20 <Vorpal>	think I'll try that one in a podman container, not on my actual system...

Feb 21 19:37:50 <phrik>	Title: Silly behaviour when installing a symlink and marking it as a "backup" file (#97) · Issues · Pacman / Pacman · GitLab (at gitlab.archlinux.org)
Feb 21 19:46:03 <brjl>	I guess it makes sense *why* it does that. But I don't think that's "expected" behaviour :þ
Feb 21 19:48:16 <Vorpal>	brjl: indeed. And a fifo makes it hang. I expect if I installed a block device that pointed to your harddrive (or just a symlink to /dev/nvme0n1) I could make it hash your entire drive as well
Feb 21 19:48:24 <Vorpal>	not going to try that one
Feb 21 19:50:00 <Vorpal>	what about two symlinks pointing to each other. I think you should get a recursion limit error from the kernel. But I wonder how pacman would handle that
Feb 21 19:51:16 <brjl>	Vorpal out there breaking pacman for the good of science
Feb 21 19:52:45 <Vorpal>	brjl: actually recursive symlinks were boring, they just ended up as (null)
Feb 21 19:53:01 <Vorpal>	symlinks to directories might be worth trying
Feb 21 19:53:45 <Vorpal>	nope, just (null) again
Feb 21 19:57:22 <Vorpal>	brjl: I would try to break dpkg/apt like this too (my paccheck replacement is multi-distro), but I have never figured out how to make .deb packages. And their bug tracker was terrible last I checked.
Feb 21 20:01:32 <Vorpal>	does anyone happen to know how to get back to the top overview page on the arch gitlab when logged in?
Feb 21 20:02:05 <Vorpal>	the one where I see "arch linux" "pacman" etc as groups
Feb 21 20:05:05 <Mathisen>	hello any that would have an idea why my browser suddenly would stop working after an update ? using thorium https://bpa.st/SZUQ
Feb 21 20:05:06 <phrik>	Title: View paste SZUQ (at bpa.st)
Feb 21 20:06:36 <jelle>	looks like it's the gentoo of browsers
Feb 21 20:06:47 <Namarrgon>	the fastest to crash browser on earth
Feb 21 20:07:00 <Namarrgon>	does it work in a different user account?
Feb 21 20:07:11 <Namarrgon>	and which packages were updated?
Feb 21 20:12:50 <Mathisen>	im looking at the github repo for thorium and i dont seem to be the only one with this issue. 
Feb 21 20:13:01 <Mathisen>	so they seem to have pushed something that broke it
Feb 21 20:14:18 <Namarrgon>	ah, so thorium itself was updated
Feb 21 20:14:32 <Mathisen>	yes

Feb 21 21:20:52 <matty_r>	Hey all, i'm noticing that makepkg is returning "/usr/share/makepkg/tidy/strip.sh: line 48: debugedit: command not found"
Feb 21 21:21:47 <matty_r>	Doesn't appear to prevent builds, but i'm also noticing a -debug package is also being built. So it might have something to do with that?
Feb 21 21:22:42 <Namarrgon>	is base-devel not installed?
Feb 21 21:22:43 <tirnanog>	you would have debugedit, had you installed the base-devel metapackage.
Feb 21 21:23:11 <matty_r>	huh, weird, base-devel isn't installed
Feb 21 21:23:41 <matty_r>	I've been running this install for years, I guess I missed a change requiring base-devel

Feb 21 21:24:23 <tirnanog>	it used to be a packge group. that's probably what went wrong.
Feb 21 21:25:33 <matty_r>	tirnanog: strange that it's only been a problem now
Feb 21 21:26:23 <Namarrgon>	did you merge a makepkg.conf.pacnew recently?
Feb 21 21:26:45 <matty_r>	I hadn't, no
Feb 21 21:26:57 <Namarrgon>	makepkg.conf isn't modified?

Feb 21 21:28:08 <Namarrgon>	UNMODIFIED      /etc/makepkg.conf

Feb 21 21:31:21 <matty_r>	right, so it's probably that debug flag in the options array making that -debug build
Feb 21 21:32:53 <matty_r>	Namarrgon: just compared my local makepkg.conf to that on gitlab. they're the same
Feb 21 21:33:12 <Namarrgon>	well, yes, pacman already confirmed that :)
Feb 21 21:33:27 <matty_r>	Of course - just checking :)
Feb 21 21:34:53 <matty_r>	changing the debug flag, to !debug, no longer creates the -debug package
Feb 21 21:34:56 <matty_r>	so that's good
Feb 21 21:35:04 <matty_r>	I wonder why they made that the default
Feb 21 21:35:46 <Namarrgon>	they matched it to the one use by devtools
Feb 21 21:35:59 <Namarrgon>	the one used for the official packages
Feb 21 21:37:03 <matty_r>	Cool, atleast that mystery is solved. Thanks mate
Feb 21 21:39:30 <varjack>	hello, I'm having some problems with nvidia and a vertical monitor. I can rotate the display with xrandr and the mouse reflects it, but the display orientation seems to align with the monitor. In other words, i'm trying to set 1080x1920 resolution with the monitor turned 90 degrees to the right. The viewport seems to reflect that resolution, but it's aligned "normally" to the monitor, so the 1080x1920 
Feb 21 21:39:36 <varjack>	resolution is put into the 1920x1080 display, if that makes sense
Feb 21 21:40:21 <varjack>	anyway. poking through Xorg.0.log i found that NVIDIA sets the mode with ViewPortIn to 1080x1920, but ViewPortOut is 1920x1080, which to me sounds like that parameter just needs to be fixed. 
Feb 21 21:40:53 <varjack>	I know that can be done with nvidia-settings and CurrentMetaMode, per the wiki, but any attempt to do anything with that parameter results in an error: unrecognized target
Feb 21 21:41:25 <varjack>	i need help working nvidia-settings to be able to update that ViewPortOut parameter. everything I've found online does not work because nvidia-settings is expecting a target and any target I throw at it, it doesn't like
Feb 21 21:48:23 <cloudowind>	:)
Feb 21 21:48:26 <cloudowind>	:)
Feb 21 21:48:33 <cloudowind>	sorry omg
Feb 21 21:49:04 <cloudowind>	this irssi window show thingie 
Feb 21 21:49:21 <cloudowind>	shouldnt use this confusing i thought i was writing somewhere else
Feb 21 22:01:29 <throstur>	how do I adjust CUDA settings on arch? nvidia-settings doesn't seem to have a "3D Options" thing
Feb 21 22:05:48 <alad>	what CUDA settings
Feb 21 22:10:57 <varjack>	ok let me simplify my question. how do i set the ViewPortOut parameter in the CurrentMetaMode attribute of nvidia-settings
Feb 21 22:11:09 <throstur>	I wanted to increase the fallback vram to use ram if I run out
Feb 21 22:11:16 <throstur>	as apparently I run just a tad short in loading SD models
Feb 21 22:20:42 <Pikk3wyn>	thomas_D8: is this on an rpi
Feb 21 22:22:31 <Pikk3wyn>	varjack: xorg.conf
Feb 21 22:23:05 <varjack>	Pikk3wyn, doesn't exist
Feb 21 22:23:10 <Pikk3wyn>	you can use something like --asign CurrentMetaMode="DP-2: 123x321 {ViewPortOut=123x123,ViewPortIn=321x123}
Feb 21 22:23:15 <Pikk3wyn>	something along those lines
Feb 21 22:23:24 <Pikk3wyn>	xorg.conf.d
Feb 21 22:24:06 <varjack>	that directory is also empty
Feb 21 22:24:11 <Pikk3wyn>	you can use Option "metamodes" "DP-2: nvid-auto-select something res +0+0 {viewportin=123x321,viewportout=123x321}
Feb 21 22:24:22 <Pikk3wyn>	of course it's empty lol
Feb 21 22:24:31 <varjack>	ok, i will give that a try
Feb 21 22:24:36 <Pikk3wyn>	you need to add a .conf there with a "Screen" section
Feb 21 22:25:10 <Pikk3wyn>	you can search/read doc how to do that because I forgot and it's just a bit of boilerplate anyway :)
Feb 21 22:25:26 <varjack>	yeah thats what i'm doing now
Feb 21 22:25:30 <Pikk3wyn>	sweet
Feb 21 22:25:59 <Pikk3wyn>	i know for a fact that will work
Feb 21 22:26:11 <Pikk3wyn>	what reason do you have to change it?
Feb 21 22:26:16 <varjack>	i believe it, i'm just now concerned about setting up xorg.conf right lol
Feb 21 22:26:27 <Pikk3wyn>	put it in xorg.conf.d
Feb 21 22:26:32 <Pikk3wyn>	xorg.conf is deprecared :)
Feb 21 22:26:36 <varjack>	basically this: (II) NVIDIA(G0): Setting mode "DP-1-4.2: nvidia-auto-select @1080x1920 +3840+0 {AllowGSYNC=Off, ViewPortIn=1080x1920, ViewPortOut=1920x1080+0+0, Rotation=90}"

Feb 21 22:26:59 <varjack>	the monitor in question is like, half rotated. the mouse is oriented right but the actual desktop isnt
Feb 21 22:27:10 <Pikk3wyn>	put that under Section "Screen"
Feb 21 22:27:40 <Pikk3wyn>	is that the desired behavior?
Feb 21 22:27:56 <varjack>	no, i want it so the desktop is rotated too
Feb 21 22:28:02 <Pikk3wyn>	rotating the screen doesnt change the res to 1080x1920
Feb 21 22:28:04 <varjack>	its basically this https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=281550

Feb 21 22:29:22 <Pikk3wyn>	varjack: upload the xorg log
Feb 21 22:29:38 <Pikk3wyn>	what is wrong with xrandr --rotate right

Feb 21 22:29:51 <varjack>	uh
Feb 21 22:30:07 <Pikk3wyn>	i reckon you just need to set the offset to 0
Feb 21 22:30:14 <varjack>	anyway. Pikk3wyn that's what i'm doing
Feb 21 22:30:36 <Pikk3wyn>	can you give me an output from xrandr --verbose, with it rotated and broken as well :)
Feb 21 22:30:46 <varjack>	yes one moment

Feb 21 22:30:59 <Pikk3wyn>	it's probably just a matter of the panning or perhaps the fb size

Feb 21 22:31:03 <Pikk3wyn>	nvidia is so fucky lmao

Feb 21 22:32:19 <Pikk3wyn>	that's a modified script that i use, has options for like 5 bins and also accepts pipes
Feb 21 22:32:53 <varjack>	xrandr config https://0x0.st/H5cx.txt
Feb 21 22:33:15 <Pikk3wyn>	what graphics switching solution are you using
Feb 21 22:33:30 <Pikk3wyn>	i'd personally recommend to use vga_switcheroo
Feb 21 22:33:36 <varjack>	display in question is DP-1-4.2
Feb 21 22:33:44 <Pikk3wyn>	or even disable intel igpu in bios
Feb 21 22:33:48 <varjack>	i'm using xrandr for the most part
Feb 21 22:34:08 <varjack>	i get configs with xrandr and save them with autorandr
Feb 21 22:34:10 <Pikk3wyn>	having an igpu also can cause bizarre issues with nvidia depending what gfx switching you use, and the card
Feb 21 22:34:26 <Pikk3wyn>	varjack: I mean for gpu selection
Feb 21 22:34:33 <Pikk3wyn>	are you using PRIME, etc?
Feb 21 22:34:51 <varjack>	oh, yeah, it's prime
Feb 21 22:34:53 <Pikk3wyn>	vga_switcheroo allows you to outright disable the intel card and choose nvidia as primary
Feb 21 22:35:05 <Pikk3wyn>	and the bios lets you disable it entirely (normally)
Feb 21 22:35:33 <Pikk3wyn>	ymmv depending how fucked the MUX is, and how they handle writing the actual framebuffer out of the mobo
Feb 21 22:35:42 <Pikk3wyn>	god help you if it copies to igpu lol
Feb 21 22:35:59 <Pikk3wyn>	i've seen some jank hardware configurations on laptops with nvidia
Feb 21 22:36:13 <varjack>	yeah i'm a bit hesitant to disable intel for now, i'm gonna try the xorg config and see if that helps
Feb 21 22:36:32 <Pikk3wyn>	varjack: do you have any reason to want the intel enabled?
Feb 21 22:36:48 <varjack>	because right now i dont know whats on intel and whats on nvidia, and the last time i went to switch it was half a day of fixing graphics from tty until i was totally switched over to nvidia
Feb 21 22:37:16 <Pikk3wyn>	on my friend's machine, if he has intel igpu enabled as well as nvidia and both are powered on, every vulkan and web render turns to seizure inducing purple and green psychedelia
Feb 21 22:37:35 <Pikk3wyn>	varjack: if you disable from bios you can always reenable in bios
Feb 21 22:37:38 <Pikk3wyn>	no software change needed
Feb 21 22:37:46 <Pikk3wyn>	linux will just use the nvidia card
Feb 21 22:38:21 <varjack>	hm, if this doesn't work i will try that
Feb 21 22:38:36 <Pikk3wyn>	i got an idea
Feb 21 22:39:45 <Pikk3wyn>	i see the 1080x1920 screen has 3840+0 offset
Feb 21 22:40:19 <varjack>	correct
Feb 21 22:40:34 <Pikk3wyn>	can you give a screenshot of what it looks like
Feb 21 22:40:45 <Pikk3wyn>	so i can visualise what side it's crapping out
Feb 21 22:41:05 <Pikk3wyn>	and what *exactly* the mouse behavior is
Feb 21 22:41:40 <varjack>	uh
Feb 21 22:41:44 <varjack>	so that was weird
Feb 21 22:41:47 <Pikk3wyn>	ja?
Feb 21 22:41:57 <Pikk3wyn>	what
Feb 21 22:42:28 <varjack>	one moment i'm just gonna take the pic with my phone
Feb 21 22:44:02 <alad>	and then your phone went up into flames?
Feb 21 22:44:05 <varjack>	https://0x0.st/H5cE.jpg
Feb 21 22:44:21 <alad>	nice, you can put that in an art gallery
Feb 21 22:44:28 <varjack>	so, the desktop software is the right resolution, but as you can see, its not oriented right
Feb 21 22:44:29 <Pikk3wyn>	reminds me of 15 years back when I was trying to wrangle the nvidia blobs on linux mint, which was what motivated me to switch to arch
Feb 21 22:44:46 <varjack>	and what happend with my screenshot is that when i went to take it, it took it of the desktop and not the glitched part
Feb 21 22:44:48 <Pikk3wyn>	gtx 465, absoluite piece of shit
Feb 21 22:44:55 <alad>	: O
Feb 21 22:45:09 <Pikk3wyn>	varjack: aha, that means it is very likely positioning or panning related
Feb 21 22:45:29 <varjack>	thats what i was thinking too
Feb 21 22:45:34 <Pikk3wyn>	what is the exact mouse behavior?
Feb 21 22:45:46 <varjack>	here's the screenshot i took lol https://0x0.st/H5c6.jpg
Feb 21 22:45:52 <Pikk3wyn>	when xorg screens overlap / too far apart, the mouse can do strange stuff
Feb 21 22:45:57 <varjack>	mouse is oriented right, i can move it over the glitched part as if it was oriented normally
Feb 21 22:46:10 <varjack>	like there's no issue with the mouse
Feb 21 22:46:55 <Pikk3wyn>	varjack: have you tried just using xrandr --auto
Feb 21 22:46:56 <Pikk3wyn>	afterwards
Feb 21 22:47:08 <varjack>	yeah no effect
Feb 21 22:47:19 <Pikk3wyn>	hmm
Feb 21 22:47:26 <Pikk3wyn>	guess we will have to see from the pic
Feb 21 22:47:50 <Pikk3wyn>	have you also tried moving the screen --left-of and then --right-of again?
Feb 21 22:48:40 <varjack>	not really, i can but i'm not sure it'll work
Feb 21 22:49:07 <Pikk3wyn>	do you have the phone pic?
Feb 21 22:49:15 <Pikk3wyn>	you can prob upload imgur or some crap easily
Feb 21 22:49:31 <varjack>	oh i already sent it
Feb 21 22:49:39 <varjack>	https://0x0.st/H5cE.jpg
Feb 21 22:49:40 <Pikk3wyn>	oh sopz
Feb 21 22:49:45 <Pikk3wyn>	ohhhhhhh shit dawg
Feb 21 22:49:53 <Pikk3wyn>	oh yeah thats another story lmao
Feb 21 22:50:02 <Pikk3wyn>	ohhhh damn
Feb 21 22:50:23 <Pikk3wyn>	from those artefacts it looks like a bona fide driver issue to me XD
Feb 21 22:50:32 <varjack>	yeah i'm like, 80% sure it's the misaligned ViewPortIn and ViewPortOut parameters
Feb 21 22:50:48 <varjack>	but everything i read online about manually setting those (besides the xorg config) doesn't work 
Feb 21 22:50:52 <Pikk3wyn>	try connecting only 1 screen and then rotating it
Feb 21 22:51:41 <Pikk3wyn>	the viewportin and viewportout (to my knowledge) basically just applies a transform on the fb to fit the viweportout, which is what xrandr is doing anyway
Feb 21 22:51:53 <Pikk3wyn>	i am not sure if the nvidia one is separate to that
Feb 21 22:51:58 <Pikk3wyn>	knowing nvidia it may well be
Feb 21 22:52:43 <Pikk3wyn>	i got an idea ay
Feb 21 22:52:48 <varjack>	thats what it feels like. what's your idea?
Feb 21 22:53:13 <Pikk3wyn>	you could try create and set a custom modeline of 1080x1920
Feb 21 22:53:23 <Pikk3wyn>	then rotate it right
Feb 21 22:53:52 <Pikk3wyn>	now it's sideways the wrong way and cutting half the screen off because it's displaying the wrong direction
Feb 21 22:54:13 <lmat>	I use sshfs to share directories across computers. When a computer turns off while sshfs is running, the other computer hangs any time it tries to show anything about that remote directory for 10 or more minutes. How do I set the timeout so that it will fail after maybe 5 or 10 seconds?
Feb 21 22:54:29 <Pikk3wyn>	if you created a 1080x1920 modline and applied it to the display with panning or something, rotated it, and removed the panning 
Feb 21 22:54:34 <Pikk3wyn>	maybe it's right way up XD
Feb 21 22:54:46 <Pikk3wyn>	lmat: sshfs is unreliable as shit
Feb 21 22:54:59 <varjack>	ok, give me a few minutes to try these
Feb 21 22:55:23 <NetSysFire>	Pikk3wyn: can you press enter a tiny bit less often? most of the backlog is you
Feb 21 22:56:10 <Pikk3wyn>	lmat: i don't think you can easily set a timeout for sshfs, you can set for it's various caches
Feb 21 22:56:26 <Pikk3wyn>	tho, you can specify SSHPOT=VAL as per ssh_config
Feb 21 22:56:40 <lmat>	Pikk3wyn: Okay, I'll look into that, thank you!
Feb 21 22:57:47 <Pikk3wyn>	lmat: also you could try -o auto_unmount
Feb 21 22:58:19 <Pikk3wyn>	you're saying the entire computer hangs?
Feb 21 22:58:30 <Pikk3wyn>	you can't switch VT or sysrq?
Feb 21 22:58:36 <Pikk3wyn>	NetSysFire: sorry :)
Feb 21 23:00:04 <lmat>	Pikk3wyn: No, not the entire computer, only the process trying to access that mount. A particular bash session, or a thunar window.
Feb 21 23:00:41 <lmat>	Pikk3wyn: I think man sshfs; has been updated since I last looked at it. It has a section: "SSHFS hangs after the connection was interrupted". It doesn't mention the auto_unmount feature you mentioned which I will research, but it talks about several other approaches, too! Thank you!
Feb 21 23:01:05 <Pikk3wyn>	lmat: you can try -o sshfs_sync -o sync_readdir -o no_readahead -o direct_io -o auto_unmount
Feb 21 23:01:20 *	lmat :-o
Feb 21 23:01:27 <Pikk3wyn>	as well as some ssh opts

Feb 21 23:28:00 <varjack>	ugh it was intel
Feb 21 23:28:09 <varjack>	i disabled hybrid graphics in the bios and now it works
Feb 21 23:29:25 <varjack>	now all of my fonts are huge
Feb 21 23:29:45 <bluetail>	Am I supposed to get rid off sshfs and use something else? As I can see it is about to be deprecated... https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs
Feb 21 23:32:26 <katia>	rclone
Feb 21 23:34:14 <bluetail>	bummer
Feb 21 23:34:26 <bluetail>	I thought rclone was only like, for temporary transfer
Feb 21 23:34:29 <bluetail>	but it has 'mount'
Feb 21 23:36:44 <virtualsid>	(I thought that too until about 2 minutes ago :P)
Feb 21 23:41:04 <Pikk3wyn>	varjack: you jsut gotta change the scaling
Feb 21 23:41:07 <Pikk3wyn>	try xsettingsd
Feb 21 23:41:26 <Pikk3wyn>	it has a global dpi setting that works with basically every gui lib that supports scaling
Feb 21 23:41:43 <Pikk3wyn>	the dpi number in the config is * 100 
Feb 21 23:41:46 <Pikk3wyn>	mine is Xft/DPI 163840
Feb 21 23:41:48 <varjack>	yeah apparently you can also do it with xrandr --dpi
Feb 21 23:41:59 <varjack>	nvidia seems to want 196 but 120 is where it was
Feb 21 23:42:01 <Pikk3wyn>	i'm on a 3840x2160 tv tho so you prob want smaller
Feb 21 23:42:04 <Pikk3wyn>	varjack: no
Feb 21 23:42:10 <Pikk3wyn>	that's xorg dpi
Feb 21 23:42:59 <Pikk3wyn>	few programs obey that nowdays, xsettingsd interacts directly with gtk qt etc and sets the scaling to match the dpi you entered so it's all consistent 
Feb 21 23:43:24 <Pikk3wyn>	only think i saw that listens to xorg dpi is i3settings and xcalc :)
Feb 21 23:43:32 <Pikk3wyn>	i3status*
Feb 21 23:43:47 <varjack>	yeah on my end it seems to be urxvt and i3
Feb 21 23:43:52 <varjack>	polybar, firefox, etc are fine
Feb 21 23:48:21 <Pikk3wyn>	varjack: you gotta hit the i3 restart thingy to make the changes stick for i3status
Feb 21 23:48:38 <Pikk3wyn>	urxvt, not sure if you just need to open a new term, or close all existing first
Feb 21 23:48:40 <bluetail>	I use i3 too at the moment for many reasons
Feb 21 23:48:58 <Pikk3wyn>	i3 is best wm
Feb 21 23:49:19 <varjack>	fr fr
Feb 21 23:49:38 <varjack>	yeah i'm tweaking all of that now. i think i gotta tune the dpi more but i should be able to handle that on my own

Feb 21 23:50:30 <Pikk3wyn>	but ja :)
Feb 21 23:50:48 <louipc>	what about wayland tho
Feb 21 23:50:54 <varjack>	i'm not on wayland 
Feb 21 23:51:18 <varjack>	but yes, thanks Pikk3wyn. seems your first suggestion was the one that worked lol
Feb 21 23:51:23 <louipc>	yea i keep flipping back and forth
Feb 21 23:51:48 <louipc>	might just start running things in browser to do more in wayland

Feb 21 23:58:01 <jb1277976>	On my main laptop it has a hdmi port yet when i put the hdmi in to the tv the sound comes from the laptop and not the tv ? any ideas ?
Feb 21 23:58:16 <jb1277976>	i think i did a lspci the other day and there was no hdmi ouput
Feb 21 23:58:41 <MrElendig>	check the profile
Feb 21 23:58:55 <Pikk3wyn>	jb1277976: change the card profile 
Feb 21 23:59:13 <Pikk3wyn>	jb1277976: it's possible you have a bit of a dodgey driver as well
Feb 21 23:59:17 <jb1277976>	How do you do that ? i'm using awesomewm
Feb 21 23:59:28 <Pikk3wyn>	you can use pavucontrol 
Feb 21 23:59:31 <Pikk3wyn>	or blueman
Feb 21 23:59:34 <MrElendig>	pavucontrol or whatever you like
Feb 21 23:59:42 <jb1277976>	ok
Feb 21 23:59:54 <jb1277976>	let me pull up pavucontrol on the laptop i'm on right now
Feb 22 00:00:13 <Pikk3wyn>	if the device doesnt show up, try take laptop battery out, hold power for 20sec, replace battery and boot
Feb 22 00:00:15 <MrElendig>	also on some laptops audio over hdmi is just broken
Feb 22 00:00:39 <Pikk3wyn>	also you can check what pci device it is that disappears sometimes, go to the parent, and trigger a rescan
Feb 22 00:01:07 <Pikk3wyn>	depending on your drivers, you can try disabling hdmi audio in one or even both of the gpus
Feb 22 00:01:14 <Pikk3wyn>	with a kernel param
Feb 22 00:01:29 <Pikk3wyn>	and it can fallback to the generic 'i don't know why the hell this works' mode
Feb 22 00:01:30 <jb1277976>	brb let me actually go get the laptop
Feb 22 00:05:37 <bluetail>	katia fff
Feb 22 00:05:56 <bluetail>	rclone is just a interface for sshfs, nfs, cifs and the likes
Feb 22 00:06:01 <bluetail>	its not a replacement of either
Feb 22 00:06:07 <bluetail>	it still uses the same stuff
Feb 22 00:06:20 <bluetail>	how can you say it is going to replace sshfs.fuse / libfuse
Feb 22 00:07:19 <bluetail>	wasted my time...
Feb 22 00:12:20 <bluetail>	looking into gvfs / gio
Feb 22 00:15:10 <Pikk3wyn>	what's wrong with nfs?
Feb 22 00:16:55 <d3Xt3r>	bluetail: sshfs isn't going anywhere, it's just that the original maintainer no longer has time to maintain it. It's been picked up by a few other developers. You could use this fork for instance: https://github.com/deadbeefsociety/sshfs
Feb 22 00:22:56 <bluetail>	thanks d3Xt3r
Feb 22 00:23:05 <bluetail>	Pikk3wyn I guess the lack of encryption by default
Feb 22 00:24:24 <rcf>	bluetail: rclone is not just an interface for sshfs 
Feb 22 00:24:48 <bluetail>	rcf it is much more, but it does not re-implement something comparable
Feb 22 00:25:05 <bluetail>	as in, an own encryptable mount system
Feb 22 00:33:09 <jb1277976>	Switching the profile helped my son is watching netflix in the other room now
Feb 22 00:33:10 <jb1277976>	Thanks all
Feb 22 00:34:40 <Pikk3wyn>	sweet
Feb 22 00:34:41 <katia>	bluetail, rclone is not 'just an interface for ssh'...
Feb 22 00:34:45 <rcf>	bluetail: but it does, that's how I use it. 
Feb 22 00:35:10 <katia>	sshfs'*
Feb 22 00:36:04 <jb1277976>	Pikk3wyn does that profile thing you said help with micphone/headphone combo also ?
Feb 22 00:39:51 <Pikk3wyn>	yes
Feb 22 00:40:01 <Pikk3wyn>	you can set the input source and output sink separately
Feb 22 00:40:31 <Pikk3wyn>	if it's bluetooth tho, you will have to use the HSP profile and related, unless you get some special patch for bidirectional audio with a2dp
Feb 22 00:43:56 <Dragoon>	I have a PKGBUILD with a _lot_ of patches, so I want them in a folder. Makepkg is complaining it can't find them, how do I make this work?
Feb 22 00:53:35 <gromit>	Dragoon: how are you referencing them in the PKGBUILD? 
Feb 22 00:53:47 <Dragoon>	relative path
Feb 22 00:54:26 <MrElendig>	post it
Feb 22 00:58:15 <Dragoon>	https://gist.github.com/DragoonX6/55be2afe6dae765c546aa58a5e15093a
Feb 22 01:00:57 <Dragoon>	I wonder if it's the noextract loop, but the wiki says that noextract is just the filename, so I added it to the noextract loop
Feb 22 01:01:10 <Dragoon>	it being the _feature_patches array
Feb 22 01:18:10 <bluetail>	if I use borg to invoke sshfs or rclone doesnt matter
Feb 22 01:18:42 <bluetail>	If not, explain it
Feb 22 01:22:21 <Dragoon>	MrElendig, gromit, any idea?
Feb 22 01:22:22 <MacGyver>	bluetail: Well if nothing else, you probably don't want to make borg operate over sshfs, because it will have to transfer everything rather than be able to minimize transferred data using deduplication and compression pre-transfer.
Feb 22 01:22:30 <MacGyver>	bluetail: See https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#what-is-the-difference-between-a-repo-on-an-external-hard-drive-vs-repo-on-a-server
Feb 22 01:22:31 <phrik>	Title: Frequently asked questions — Borg - Deduplicating Archiver 1.2.7 documentation (at borgbackup.readthedocs.io)
Feb 22 01:22:39 <MacGyver>	bluetail: How that compares to rclone, dunno.
Feb 22 01:22:43 <Dragoon>	I tried file:/// and local:// and it doesn't work in those cases either
Feb 22 01:24:39 <gromit>	Dragoon: nope no clue then, also the PKGBUILD generally looks too wild for my taste .. Good luck thouh ;) 
Feb 22 01:24:59 <Dragoon>	lol yeah, it's very wild
Feb 22 01:30:33 <Scimmia>	Dragoon: pretty sure your issue is that they're not put in scrdir in the dirs, just as individual files
Feb 22 01:31:37 <Scimmia>	or as symlinks, can't remember how that's handled, but it won't be in dir
Feb 22 01:31:38 <Scimmia>	dirs
Feb 22 01:32:14 <Scimmia>	check what's in $srcdir for youself
Feb 22 01:33:45 <rcf>	bluetail: rclone does not invoke sshfs 
Feb 22 01:33:57 <rcf>	It's its own implementation. 
Feb 22 01:34:25 <rcf>	It uses sftp underneath, but that's not being deprecated. Only sshfs. 
Feb 22 01:34:40 <rcf>	(and the protocol, not any given implementation -- it supports two) 
Feb 22 01:34:53 <Dragoon>	Scimmia: src is empty, makepkg doesn't get that far
Feb 22 01:35:04 <Scimmia>	oh, you're using basename, so that should work
Feb 22 01:35:10 <bluetail>	rcf it still depends on fuse3 but thats something else right?
Feb 22 01:35:15 <rcf>	Indeed. 
Feb 22 01:35:24 <bluetail>	I see
Feb 22 01:35:33 <rcf>	Any userland filesystem will depend on fuse. 
Feb 22 01:35:34 <bluetail>	so I do need to use sshfs. I was unsure
Feb 22 01:35:34 <Scimmia>	Dragoon: actual log?
Feb 22 01:35:46 <bluetail>	to be fair the rclone docs are not good
Feb 22 01:35:56 <bluetail>	I could improve them, but they would complain about verbosity
Feb 22 01:36:01 <rcf>	bluetail: you do not. I do not have sshfs installed at all and it still mounts over sftp just fine. 
Feb 22 01:36:08 <Dragoon>	Scimmia: ==> ERROR: 0201-EFI-early-Add-noexit-to-inhibit-calling-ExitBootServ.patch was not found in the build directory and is not a URL.
Feb 22 01:36:12 <Dragoon>	That's the actual error
Feb 22 01:36:13 <bluetail>	rcf I see. thanks
Feb 22 01:36:38 <rcf>	bluetail: the one annoyance is that it requires your keyfiles bein in PEM format, rather than standard OpenSSH. 
Feb 22 01:37:01 <Scimmia>	Dragoon: ah, yeah, use file:// or local://
Feb 22 01:37:24 <bluetail>	rcf I just noticed it wants a host, but I need to use IP instead cause DNS doesnt work properly in my setup
Feb 22 01:37:40 <rcf>	bluetail: an IP will work fine. 
Feb 22 01:38:34 <Scimmia>	Dragoon: similar handling here: https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=ttf-ms-win11#n179 I use file:// so I can override it in DLAGENTS, but I think local:// is the prefered way
Feb 22 01:38:36 <phrik>	Title: PKGBUILD - aur.git - AUR Package Repositories (at aur.archlinux.org)
Feb 22 01:49:04 <Steven_M>	Hi. :-) I was watching an old youtube video about archinstall. Are there still two archinstall programs with the exact same package name?
Feb 22 01:49:25 <Scimmia>	I wasn't aware there ever was
Feb 22 01:49:38 <louipc>	there is only one package on this end
Feb 22 01:50:21 <louipc>	maybe it was a major version bump created very different behavior?
Feb 22 01:50:29 <louipc>	eh no use speculating
Feb 22 01:50:34 <tirnanog>	Dragoon: that's an unsafe and needless use of basename, by the way. noextract+=( "${_patches[@]##*/}" ) would do. I'm not sure why you wwere appending checksums to noextract.
Feb 22 01:50:55 <Scimmia>	Even AUR couldn't have the same package name. If they're talking about some 3rd party repo, who knows
Feb 22 01:51:04 <Dragoon>	tirnanog: oh that's a bug
Feb 22 01:51:08 <Dragoon>	good catch
Feb 22 01:52:18 <tirnanog>	you don't need to fork for basename repeatedly as parameter expansion can deal with it. if you had actually needed to, ( "$(basename -- "$file")" ) would have made more sense.
Feb 22 01:52:51 <Dragoon>	as for the loop, I didn't write that, I added the _feature_patch_sums to the loop
Feb 22 01:53:04 <Dragoon>	so bug introduced by me, loop by not me
Feb 22 01:53:07 <tirnanog>	ok. well, now you now :D
Feb 22 01:53:27 <tirnanog>	er, know even.
Feb 22 01:56:59 <Steven_M>	Here's the video with the timestamp talking about 2 different archinstalls: https://youtu.be/G-mLyrHonvU?t=86
Feb 22 01:58:05 <Scimmia>	Steven_M: guy's just an idiot
Feb 22 01:58:27 <Scimmia>	likely using an old ISO or something
Feb 22 01:58:52 <bluetail>	rcf I did the setup
Feb 22 01:59:02 <bluetail>	I installed the pem key
Feb 22 01:59:04 <bluetail>	I can't mount
Feb 22 01:59:26 <Steven_M>	Scimmia: okay, sorry
Feb 22 02:00:23 <bluetail>	rclone mount 2tb1-ssd-archm1: /rclone/2tb1-ssd  https://0x0.st/H5Ai.txt
Feb 22 02:01:12 <bluetail>	ssh login works fine
Feb 22 02:01:23 <bluetail>	rclone is installed on both machines
Feb 22 02:01:43 <bluetail>	I thought rclone handles its own implementation, and after setup on client, theres nothing to do on server
Feb 22 02:02:01 <bluetail>	I did...  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/private_key.pem blu@192.168.178.31 manually
Feb 22 02:02:03 <bluetail>	and tested it works
Feb 22 02:02:50 <bluetail>	what confuses me about the config file is that the path is missing
Feb 22 02:03:06 <bluetail>	I gotta double check syntax
Feb 22 02:05:40 <bluetail>	could it be possible that client and server path must be identical? If so, thats a confusing concept
Feb 22 02:06:13 <Steven_M>	I have installed Arch manually many times, but I'm planning a fresh install, and I thought I'd try out the installer this time just to speed the process up.
Feb 22 02:08:37 <Dragoon>	Scimmia: what does the DLAGENTS override do?
Feb 22 02:09:21 <Steven_M>	I do have one question before I proceed though, typing it out now.
Feb 22 02:10:08 <bluetail>	this is always the same
Feb 22 02:10:26 <bluetail>	you absolutely need to run a separate sftp server on target
Feb 22 02:10:55 <bluetail>	thanks for planting this idea into my head that all I needed was to run rclone for sshfs 
Feb 22 02:11:04 <Dragoon>	If I use file://, I can make it work with file://$PWD/ in the expansion, but that "downloads" them to the root directory using curl lol
Feb 22 02:11:31 <bluetail>	good advice with well-documented stuff is rarely to get by
Feb 22 02:11:59 <bluetail>	I will ditch rclone, it isn't what was advertised in here for
Feb 22 02:12:20 <bluetail>	thanks for AGAIN making me waste my time
Feb 22 02:13:00 <bluetail>	rclone does not come with a sshfs implementation
Feb 22 02:13:17 <bluetail>	rather sftp, but running rclone on target and client does not do the job
Feb 22 02:15:25 <bluetail>	rcf why did you confus sshfs with sftp
Feb 22 02:15:33 <bluetail>	those things are different
Feb 22 02:15:48 <bluetail>	for the latter you need to run a small program 
Feb 22 02:16:00 <bluetail>	on the server
Feb 22 02:16:52 <Namarrgon>	what program? sshd?
Feb 22 02:17:05 <Steven_M>	I'd still like to partition and format my drive manually. Can I do this before running the installer, and then just specify the mount points in the installer, or will the installer force me to use its partitioner?
Feb 22 02:17:29 <bluetail>	Namarrgon nope
Feb 22 02:18:06 <bluetail>	if I want to connect to an SFTP server, I need to setup a SFTP agent. A really simple one can be run from python, similar as the httpserver
Feb 22 02:18:23 *	Steven_M has to go AFK, but will leave IRC open.
Feb 22 02:18:23 <Namarrgon>	"sftp agent"?
Feb 22 02:18:39 <bluetail>	its not that, if I set up to connect for SFTP, that it will connect through ssh and magically become "SFTP"
Feb 22 02:18:55 <bluetail>	A SFTP server has to run
Feb 22 02:18:58 <bluetail>	which I don't
Feb 22 02:19:09 <bluetail>	which was clearly the expectation that I do not need to take care about
Feb 22 02:19:12 <Namarrgon>	like openssh's sshd??
Feb 22 02:19:34 <bluetail>	sshd runs, SFTP does not work through rclone
Feb 22 02:19:41 <bluetail>	so theres clearly something super off
Feb 22 02:19:53 <bluetail>	I need to run a dedicated SFTP server, what else could be wrong?
Feb 22 02:20:35 <bluetail>	given pem key is installed, checked working, mount times out and does absolutely nothing. All ssh details are correct
Feb 22 02:20:37 <Namarrgon>	something is wrong on your end then
Feb 22 02:21:01 <bluetail>	for fucks sake, I have better things to do than to listen to incomplete advices
Feb 22 02:21:09 <Namarrgon>	arch's default sshd_config will allow sftp connections
Feb 22 02:21:10 <bluetail>	I followed the documentation and it didnt work
Feb 22 02:22:09 <Namarrgon>	grep sftp /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Feb 22 02:22:30 <bluetail>	Subsystem	sftp	/usr/lib/ssh/sftp-server
Feb 22 02:23:59 <rcf>	bluetail: sshfs uses sftp as well. 
Feb 22 02:24:02 <Namarrgon>	is that on the server you're trinyg to connect to?
Feb 22 02:24:09 <bluetail>	yes
Feb 22 02:24:10 <rcf>	If sshfs works, rclone should work. 
Feb 22 02:24:20 <bluetail>	but doesnt
Feb 22 02:24:32 <Namarrgon>	have you tried taking a nap? you seem to be frustrated
Feb 22 02:25:41 <bluetail>	Thats a good idea... 
Feb 22 02:25:50 <mefistofeles>	!nap
Feb 22 02:25:50 <phrik>	http://www.kirikoo.net/images/14Anonyme-20130228-010243.jpg
Feb 22 02:25:54 <rcf>	You're telling me I'm confused, but you've never actually looked into how any of this works. 
Feb 22 02:35:07 <absinthium>	What's the most minimalist PDF viewer?
Feb 22 02:35:24 <absinthium>	Do any run in terminal? `less` is showing binary information for the PDF I tested it on.
Feb 22 02:35:32 <absinthium>	Or encoded, rather.
Feb 22 02:37:54 <rcf>	For terminal viewing you're kind of screwed, there's no general-purpose solution. 
Feb 22 02:39:00 <bluetail>	absinthium zathura
Feb 22 02:39:48 <bluetail>	rcf the stuff worked out, I got the GUI for rclone, I had to convert id_rsa in PEM format, rather than installing a new PEM key. I still don't like the UX, rclone has no good UX and no good docs
Feb 22 02:40:32 <hmw[at]>	absinthium: For Windows, I recently discovered the Sumatra PDF Viewer. Written as if I had made it for myself.
Feb 22 02:41:41 <hmw[at]>	oops
Feb 22 02:41:43 <bluetail>	nvm rcf, paths seem to be missing... next issue
Feb 22 02:41:48 <hmw[at]>	I thought this is #programming
Feb 22 02:42:03 <Namarrgon>	why do you need rclone? is rsync not good enough?
Feb 22 02:42:14 <rcf>	Namarrgon: concerns over sshfs dying off
Feb 22 02:42:23 <bluetail>	Maybe I should just sleep
Feb 22 02:42:24 <Namarrgon>	uh huh
Feb 22 02:42:27 <bluetail>	this is irrational af
Feb 22 02:42:41 <rcf>	bluetail: I'd recommend just... keep using sshfs honestly. 
Feb 22 02:42:53 <bluetail>	no it all started that fuse started complaining noauto is no longer valid and that stuff
Feb 22 02:43:39 <bluetail>	https://0x0.st/H5AP.txt
Feb 22 02:43:46 <bluetail>	I used to have _netdev,user,noauto,nofail
Feb 22 02:43:49 <bluetail>	I had to delete them
Feb 22 02:44:00 <bluetail>	wait, except nofail
Feb 22 02:44:22 <bluetail>	cause apparently, those options were dropped or something like that
Feb 22 02:44:39 <bluetail>	I am worried that if they aren't available at boot time now, that it wont boot
Feb 22 02:44:46 <Namarrgon>	what is the exact error?
Feb 22 02:44:54 <Namarrgon>	noauto does not get passed to the mount helper
Feb 22 02:45:16 <bluetail>	well yes, thats the issue
Feb 22 02:45:25 <Namarrgon>	what is the issue?
Feb 22 02:45:32 <bluetail>	I had a script running for mounting a minute after boot. It no more worked at all
Feb 22 02:45:55 <bluetail>	when I then tried to manually mount /mydirectory, I got the issue that -o user ... or something is an unknown option
Feb 22 02:46:02 <bluetail>	so I deleted it, and the manual mount worked
Feb 22 02:46:10 <bluetail>	this is ridiculous, look at it:
Feb 22 02:46:17 <Namarrgon>	don't "or something" us, post actual output
Feb 22 02:47:23 <bluetail>	going through history
Feb 22 02:49:30 <bluetail>	I need to revert to an earlier sshfs version because right now I don't get errors because my binary is from the link posted earlier
Feb 22 02:49:42 <bluetail>	https://github.com/deadbeefsociety/sshfs
Feb 22 02:50:41 <Namarrgon>	that is not the sshfs package that arch ships
Feb 22 02:52:26 <bluetail>	yea so I did undo it, now I need to revert to the point where I was
Feb 22 02:52:37 <bluetail>	I have it in my borg repo 
Feb 22 02:53:15 <bluetail>	mounting takes a while...
Feb 22 02:54:53 <bluetail>	here: sudo mount /sshfsmounts/2tb-1 fuse: unknown option(s): `-o nofail'
Feb 22 02:55:28 <bluetail>	https://0x0.st/H5AT.txt
Feb 22 02:55:45 <bluetail>	and for the reason for it working on-and-off, I had been using a silly script
Feb 22 02:55:59 <bluetail>	which I post in a sec
Feb 22 02:59:22 <Namarrgon>	https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/31260
Feb 22 02:59:35 <Namarrgon>	ugh, wrong link
Feb 22 02:59:37 <Namarrgon>	https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/issues/717
Feb 22 03:00:19 <bluetail>	https://paste.cachyos.org/p/90a8f45.sh
Feb 22 03:00:20 <phrik>	Title: 90a8f45 (at paste.cachyos.org)
Feb 22 03:00:47 <bluetail>	yea Namarrgon thats what I saw earlier
Feb 22 03:00:59 <bluetail>	then I read a changelog, saying that some options have been discarded
Feb 22 03:01:11 <Namarrgon>	is that why you have that script or is the script what triggers that issue?
Feb 22 03:01:46 <bluetail>	neither of that
Feb 22 03:02:21 <bluetail>	I used to run the script to mount the sshfs, cause it would not mount at boot time anyways, and that would work
Feb 22 03:02:53 <bluetail>	since a bit, it did no more, then I would change fstab and remove noauto, user and _netdev and mount as a user via sudo mount myfolder
Feb 22 03:02:57 <bluetail>	and that would work
Feb 22 03:02:59 <bluetail>	but its annoying
Feb 22 03:03:09 <bluetail>	and its kinda a back and forth between me and whatever this is
Feb 22 03:03:17 <Namarrgon>	then it's your script that triggers the bug in the report
Feb 22 03:03:20 <bluetail>	in nixos, I would define a systemd mount and not have that issue
Feb 22 03:03:30 <bluetail>	it used to work
Feb 22 03:03:32 <Namarrgon>	does that not  work in arch?
Feb 22 03:03:54 <bluetail>	it DOES but the behavior is not reproducible as nixos is
Feb 22 03:03:57 <Namarrgon>	systemd itself will handle "nofail" just fine
Feb 22 03:04:06 <bluetail>	I even have the part that does this
Feb 22 03:05:22 <bluetail>	dang
Feb 22 03:05:22 <bluetail>	had
Feb 22 03:06:46 <bluetail>	Namarrgon I wouldn't need the script if systemd through fstab would mount the folder
Feb 22 03:06:57 <bluetail>	target is running...
Feb 22 03:07:03 <Namarrgon>	i mean through a .mount unit
Feb 22 03:07:33 <bluetail>	I had done it via systemd timers on nixos
Feb 22 03:07:40 <Namarrgon>	timers?
Feb 22 03:08:07 *	edu4rdshl wonder why people can't hold its Enter key a bit
Feb 22 03:08:57 <bluetail>	Yea, I let it run 2 min after boot
Feb 22 03:40:30 <bluetail>	it appears to be working... hopefully... I reboot 
Feb 22 04:02:24 <bluetail>	works...
Feb 22 04:29:32 <Steven_M>	I want to use arch-install for my new installation, but I want to use gparted to do the partitioning and formatting of my drive first. Does arch-install allow you to simply select the mount points for existing partitions, or does it force you to do the partitioning and formatting from within the installer?
Feb 22 04:30:31 <thingfish>	Steven_M: why not try it in a VM and see?
Feb 22 04:33:13 <Steven_M>	thingfish: okay.
Feb 22 04:38:24 <edu4rdshl>	Steven_M, you can create a profile for that
Feb 22 04:38:37 <edu4rdshl>	If you want it to be non-interactive
Feb 22 04:40:08 <Steven_M>	edu4rdshl: okay, thanks :-)
Feb 22 06:48:14 <Steven_M>	I download a snapshot for an AUR package, but there are no validkeys listed in the .SRCINFO, is that normal?
Feb 22 06:49:36 <mefistofeles>	!give Steven_M aur
Feb 22 06:49:36 <phrik>	Steven_M: The trash heap of Arch. Dig around enough and maybe you will find some gold.
Feb 22 06:51:29 <Steven_M>	mefistofeles: fair enough
Feb 22 06:51:54 <Steven_M>	:)
Feb 22 06:53:19 <edu4rdshl>	Steven_M, yes, why not
Feb 22 06:59:25 <Scimmia>	Steven_M: is the source signed?
Feb 22 07:21:05 <Steven_M>	Scimmia: not that I can see.

Feb 22 07:23:04 <phrik>	Title: Linux.Chat PrivateBin (at paste.linux.chat)
Feb 22 07:23:04 <EMIYA>	repasted ⇒ https://0x0.st/H5m7.txt
Feb 22 07:26:21 <rcf>	They don't release with signatures, so no. 
Feb 22 07:26:33 <rcf>	It's an open issue https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/1419
Feb 22 08:10:00 <Steven_M>	rcf: sorry I was AFK. I'm not going to install/use ventoy then. Thanks for the info. :-)
Feb 22 08:15:21 <Steven_M>	I have another question about archinstall, can it handle the creation and mounting of BTRFS subvolumes?
Feb 22 08:30:43 <edu4rdshl>	Packages without any signature are just finme
Feb 22 08:31:00 <edu4rdshl>	In fact, 99% of software do releases without signatures
Feb 22 08:31:11 <edu4rdshl>	sha sums as much
Feb 22 08:31:58 <edu4rdshl>	And, as shown in the linked issue, not even a tumbs up, almost nobody care about that (including me)
Feb 22 08:32:34 <edu4rdshl>	Not saying that not having signatures is good, but deciding to not use something because that is...
Feb 22 08:32:46 <down200>	I appear to have missed a conversation about Ventoy, did someone say it is not advisable to use? Been using a ventoy drive for a couple years now without any problems
Feb 22 08:33:05 <edu4rdshl>	down200, no, nobody said that
Feb 22 08:35:05 <down200>	I see, good to know
Feb 22 08:50:55 <Steven_M>	edu4rdshl: without signatures, how do you the software hasn't been tampered with?
Feb 22 08:51:28 <edu4rdshl>	Steven_M, then don't use 99% of packages from the repos because they don't have any signature :D
Feb 22 08:51:41 <edu4rdshl>	They have a *packager* signature
Feb 22 08:51:58 <edu4rdshl>	But the releases itself doesn't have, in most cases
Feb 22 09:18:34 <Steven_M>	edu4rdshl: but I thought makepkg requires signature checking by default.
Feb 22 09:18:48 <rcf>	makepkg defaults to it *if available*. 
Feb 22 09:19:29 <Steven_M>	rcf: oh, okay
Feb 22 09:20:17 <rcf>	For repo packages, the assumption is: you're already trusting the packager to build the source they said they would, so you're also trusting them to use some sort of discretion in deciding whether or not a given source is reputable. 
Feb 22 09:22:16 <rcf>	For things in the AUR... that's your job. You can cross-reference the checksums and use HTTPS and you'll probably be fine, barring a serious attack. And given a serious attack, for a small project... how good is their key management anyway? 
Feb 22 09:22:31 <Steven_M>	edu4rdshl: rcf: yeah, I think I was getting mixed up with *packager* signatures, sorry.
Feb 22 09:23:30 <edu4rdshl>	Steven_M, as a note: when you build the AUR package, the packager is yourself :p
Feb 22 09:24:38 <Steven_M>	true. :-)
Feb 22 09:29:01 <mpan>	Steven_M: to complete the picture regarding trust, work is being done on reproducible builds <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Reproducible_Builds>, so it may be verified by third parties the packager is neither malicious nor careless.

Feb 22 10:03:50 <wunit>	Red_man: please be a little patient, this is a community of volunteers, people will respond when they find time
Feb 22 10:03:51 <Red_man>	thank you havent used arch since 2015
Feb 22 10:04:01 <Red_man>	ok
Feb 22 10:04:15 <astralc>	journalctl is the log
Feb 22 10:04:26 <Red_man>	ty
Feb 22 10:09:35 <Red_man>	im seeing disabled mem because it overlaps
Feb 22 10:10:54 <mpan>	Probably not the cause of hangs. See for the log around the time hangs happen.
Feb 22 10:13:12 <Red_man>	oh yeah cool
Feb 22 10:14:24 <dagle>	Also did you do something particular and how much ram?
Feb 22 10:14:41 <Red_man>	see i updated with pacman -Syu and it hasnt froze yet 
Feb 22 10:15:47 <Red_man>	alsa amusing a usb mouse switched usb slots and it froze but just keyboard
Feb 22 10:16:04 <Red_man>	any
Feb 22 10:16:08 <Red_man>	way
Feb 22 10:18:37 <masterkorp>	Hello, has anyone got a external dual screen usb screen working with displaylink ? 
Feb 22 10:21:43 <bookworm>	I had it yes but you need the binary blob driver
Feb 22 10:21:57 <bookworm>	which breaks often enough in Arch land
Feb 22 10:23:30 <masterkorp>	Which one ? I have the evdi and displaylink ? bookworm
Feb 22 10:24:13 <bookworm>	those, yes
Feb 22 10:24:30 <masterkorp>	I get the dual screens on my dock working
Feb 22 10:24:41 <masterkorp>	but not not my dual screen portable display 
Feb 22 10:24:50 <bookworm>	ah then I don't know
Feb 22 10:24:52 <masterkorp>	and have no idea how do debug the issue further 
Feb 22 10:25:23 <bookworm>	I switched to a different docking station without display link
Feb 22 10:25:34 <masterkorp>	Mine works, its nice
Feb 22 10:25:42 <masterkorp>	and the protable screen is awesome
Feb 22 10:25:49 <masterkorp>	minus 1 screen not working 
Feb 22 10:25:58 <masterkorp>	its perfect for coworking spaces
Feb 22 10:27:38 <Red_man>	soto get an update its pacman -syu
Feb 22 10:27:43 <Steven_M>	bye for now :-)

Feb 22 10:42:00 <Red_man>	sorry illlook it up
Feb 22 10:42:02 <virtualsid>	there's more than just one... but if you're asking for one, I guess there's i3, which is what I use.
Feb 22 10:42:23 <Repentinus>	There's Sway.
Feb 22 10:42:27 <Red_man>	yes thats it
Feb 22 10:43:45 <parakovsky>	guys did anybody figure out how to use twitter as a text based thing like it used to work in bitlbee and stuff before mister mustard takeover? I have python thing called rainbow something and bitlbee client both giving me connection errors, wonder if there is any way around that
Feb 22 10:44:49 <virtualsid>	I thought they basically got rid of almost all API use?
Feb 22 10:46:00 <parakovsky>	yes thinks that the case but also think i helped someone to set up python script there and it turn out every user can have a free api with some limits or something
Feb 22 10:46:30 <virtualsid>	ahh, okay.
Feb 22 10:52:58 <Red_man>	no hang upsin over 2 hours hmm
Feb 22 11:08:18 <Earnestly>	Is there such a thing as an small (5/4 port) unmanaged switch that is powered by PoE but is not a PoE switch itself?
Feb 22 11:18:08 <rcf>	Earnestly: I'm almost certain I've seen one, let me check... 
Feb 22 11:18:38 <Earnestly>	rcf: Closest I've seen are unifi minis
Feb 22 11:21:29 <eson123>	ok so i am trying out hashcat on Arch and when i do "hashcat -I" to show the information of OpenCL, it keeps on showing me "No devices found/left." so i guess there is something wrong with the driver ? and maybe a reinstallation is best, which the same time i found this page https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions#i_may_have_the_wrong_driver_installed_what_should_i_do that guide me on how to do it, but it seems like it isn't 
Feb 22 11:21:29 <eson123>	focused on Arch and i don't find any "nvidia-uninstall" command around here, so is there any equivalent one for Arch ?
Feb 22 11:21:30 <phrik>	Title: frequently_asked_questions [hashcat wiki] (at hashcat.net)
Feb 22 11:23:50 <Earnestly>	rcf: Hm, one or two miktotik's, if you include routers as possible switches. All managed though
Feb 22 11:25:04 <Earnestly>	rcf: Seems closest is RB260GS
Feb 22 11:26:32 <Earnestly>	Or hEX lite, shrug
Feb 22 11:27:48 <Earnestly>	(Which can run openwrt, so that's nice)
Feb 22 11:30:03 <rcf>	Earnestly: unfortunately all I can find are ones with passthrough 
Feb 22 11:30:33 <Earnestly>	Yeah, it's surprisingly difficult
Feb 22 11:34:45 <Earnestly>	(Not hex lite, just 'hex', which is gigabit)
Feb 22 11:37:33 <rcf>	I’d probably go for a pass through model and some cheapo splitters (which block the power signal)
Feb 22 11:47:43 <MacGyver>	Earnestly: The unifi 5-port units are managed, they're pretty noisy on the network when not adopted.
Feb 22 11:48:52 <Earnestly>	Yes, all of the ones I found are managed
Feb 22 11:51:05 <Earnestly>	MacGyver: Also do you mean fan noisy or line noise?
Feb 22 11:52:23 <Earnestly>	(Tbf, I'd probably never go with unifi)
Feb 22 11:53:13 <Earnestly>	MacGyver: Also I see what you mean by this "adopt" thing, that's kind of incredible
Feb 22 12:07:06 <louipc>	bad or good
Feb 22 12:08:33 <edu4rdshl>	eson123, 1) which graphics card do you have, 2) is it a latop with hybrid graphics, 3) do you have installed the required packages for your graphics card?
Feb 22 12:08:59 <colo>	there's a number of managed switch models (1Gbps only so far) that run very fine with OpenWrt flashed.
Feb 22 12:09:20 <edu4rdshl>	On Arch you don't use that "nvidia-uninstall" thing, eson123, you just remove the package using pacman
Feb 22 12:13:53 <NetSysFire>	hm, do we have the arch-wiki-docs package installed by default on the archiso?
Feb 22 12:14:04 <NetSysFire>	it sounds like a great addition if it isnt there already
Feb 22 12:15:48 <MrElendig>	eson123: how did you install the nvidia drivers?
Feb 22 12:18:54 <kusf>	Hello #archlinux! I was trying to do an update and I recieved this error and didn't dare look this up for fear of bad information: failed to synchronize all databases (unable to lock database)
Feb 22 12:19:17 <grawity>	a) another pacman is already running or b) pacman crashed and didn't get a chance to remove db.lck
Feb 22 12:19:25 <grawity>	or c) you're not root
Feb 22 12:19:36 <kusf>	grawity: Thank you will go through the list now!
Feb 22 12:19:40 <NetSysFire>	always use the archwiki which usually doesnt have bad information
Feb 22 12:19:53 <NetSysFire>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman#%22Failed_to_init_transaction_(unable_to_lock_database)%22_error
Feb 22 12:19:54 <phrik>	Title: pacman - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Feb 22 12:20:04 <grawity>	if you're *sure* it's b) and not a) after checking the process list, you can rm the lock file manually
Feb 22 12:22:34 <kusf>	grawity: Thank you. I did a `ps -ef` and didn't see any pacman running but there is a db.lck sitting there in /var/lib/pacman/ - I believe that's the problem!
Feb 22 12:22:47 <eson123>	MrElendig: god it has been so long i am not sure now
Feb 22 12:22:50 <eson123>	how do i recheck that 
Feb 22 12:22:51 <kusf>	NetSysFire: I just found that url after asking in here, thank you!
Feb 22 12:23:06 <MrElendig>	pacman -Qs nvidia
Feb 22 12:23:17 <NetSysFire>	(as an archwiki maintainer i can say the archwiki *usually* doesnt have bad information, but i also do know all the dark and dank corners, so)
Feb 22 12:23:18 <MrElendig>	might give a hint
Feb 22 12:23:40 <eson123>	edu4rdshl: and i am not using a laptop, but a desktop and so far i only see NVDIA when i switch to Windows but iirc someone who repaired my computer last couple of years used to say it has an Intel as well which i don't quite understand 
Feb 22 12:24:04 <kusf>	Thanks a bunch, grawity and NetSysFire! NetSysFire that's really good to learn, actually. I wasn't aware there could be an issue on the wiki itself in rare cases so it makes me glad I asked in here just in case.
Feb 22 12:24:50 <eson123>	MrElendig: here https://termbin.com/8t50, so those local/<whatever> i guess the <whatever> is the name of the package ?
Feb 22 12:25:00 <grawity>	does it have an hdmi/vga output on the mainboard? most intel CPUs have an integrated GPU, but many desktop PC firmwares will *hide* the iGPU when a discrete GPU is detected
Feb 22 12:25:02 <MrElendig>	`man pacman`
Feb 22 12:26:29 <grawity>	this is why I hate being in this channel someties
Feb 22 12:27:06 <eson123>	seems like it, but not sure if uninstalling all of those will lead to my UI not being processed correctly the next reboot :/
Feb 22 12:27:14 <NetSysFire>	kusf: stuff like that is usually marked, so especially pages like pacman are very safe to use
Feb 22 12:28:05 <NetSysFire>	i'd generally trust the wiki. if you want to be extra sure, check the talk page.
Feb 22 12:28:14 <kusf>	NetSysFire: Noted, that means I'll catch any unconfirmed information on there easily. Thanks!
Feb 22 12:28:31 <NetSysFire>	the problem is mostly small pages or outdated information but luckily its a wiki and everyone can contribute if they see something wrong
Feb 22 12:30:53 <kusf>	NetSysFire: Yes, if I happen to know something and be able to help there I'll definitely join in. Great to know.
Feb 22 12:50:34 <grawity>	so I'm trying to use oracle's oci-cli on two machines
Feb 22 12:50:43 <grawity>	one works, the other throws out a "pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'types-python-dateutil>=2.8.10' distribution was not found and is required by arrow"
Feb 22 12:50:54 <grawity>	and *apparently* that's because I had impacket installed
Feb 22 12:51:06 <astralc>	"I'm using oracle" is never good start
Feb 22 12:51:27 <grawity>	is "fuck you" any better
Feb 22 12:52:11 <grawity>	i'm guessing this is why people say "use pipx"
Feb 22 12:52:50 <grawity>	(except pipx seemed even more likely to break like that, last I used it)
Feb 22 12:56:25 <Earnestly>	pip install foobar itself will typically prompt users to use pipx instead
Feb 22 12:58:51 <astralc>	grawity: how having it installed cause that? there is name collision or internal check?
Feb 22 12:58:57 <grawity>	I have no idea
Feb 22 12:59:14 <grawity>	but it was in the stack trace somehow
Feb 22 13:00:05 <Foxboron>	grawity: huh, that sounds weird.
Feb 22 13:00:28 <grawity>	let me pacman -S impacket again
Feb 22 13:00:51 <grawity>	https://nullroute.lt/tmp/txt/20240222.140043.O28uJz.txt
Feb 22 13:01:03 <astralc>	check ,local/lib stuff that you not have accidently some old package there
Feb 22 13:01:31 <grawity>	I suppose something does 'import services' and it finds /usr/bin/services.py
Feb 22 13:01:37 <grawity>	because that's in sys.path for /usr/bin/oci
Feb 22 13:02:33 <grawity>	oh well I don't actually need impacket but
Feb 22 13:03:53 <astralc>	first time I hear about /usr/bin in python sys.path
Feb 22 13:05:51 <grawity>	that's literally sys.path[0]
Feb 22 13:07:52 <astralc>	right, forgot the script location

Feb 22 14:34:45 <madprops>	How do I find the size of the kernel. I'm doing: du -h -m /boot/vmlinuz*   Is it really 13mb ?
Feb 22 14:35:13 <mpan>	madprops: that’s the size of the initramfs image.
Feb 22 14:35:22 <mpan>	Define “size of the kernel” better.
Feb 22 14:35:40 <madprops>	well I wanted to know how much docker images save on storage by re-using the kernel
Feb 22 14:37:27 <Namarrgon>	vmlinuz-* is the kernel image
Feb 22 14:37:39 <Namarrgon>	unless you renamed it
Feb 22 14:37:45 <mpan>	ARGH
Feb 22 14:37:49 <mpan>	Namarrgon++
Feb 22 14:37:57 <mpan>	My brain circuitry misfired.
Feb 22 14:38:04 <grawity>	madprops: the kernel in /boot/vmlinuz, the kernel modules in /lib/modules, and half the packages that a container never needs but a regular VM will probably have just in case
Feb 22 14:38:25 <mpan>	But still the other part remains valid, as it’s hard to generally say what “kernel size” is. With modules? Without?
Feb 22 14:39:43 <grawity>	madprops: ah, and the initramfs that includes a copy of like half the modules and firmware
Feb 22 14:40:17 <madprops>	i see. thanks
Feb 22 14:43:31 <MacGyver>	Earnestly: Line noise, it'll blast discovery packets every (few) second(s) into the network.
Feb 22 14:45:47 <Earnestly>	I was slightly confused because I didn't expect a feature like "Adopt" to exist
Feb 22 14:45:59 <grawity>	it's a pretty normal feature for devices that have a controller
Feb 22 14:46:54 <Earnestly>	tp-link's omada is likely the same
Feb 22 14:49:43 <randomxusr>	Wondering how to set the channel width on a wifi adapter. It's and ax210 and always get the device is busy. I've been attempting to use nmcli as follows - sudo iw dev wlan1 set channel 6 HT40+   any adviced how I could set the channel width?
Feb 22 14:52:13 <MrElendig>	randomxusr: is the ap set to 40MHz?
Feb 22 14:52:29 <grawity>	that's not nmcli, and I'm not sure you can set it as a client
Feb 22 14:53:38 <grawity>	well, I guess you might be able to do it through iw "set bitrates"
Feb 22 14:53:50 <grawity>	to limit which MCS modes it's allowed to use
Feb 22 14:58:01 <randomxusr>	@MrElendig, no. it's set to 20mhz
Feb 22 14:58:16 <MrElendig>	randomxusr: then you will be limited to 20MHz no matter what
Feb 22 14:58:52 <grawity>	yeah the client can only scale down, it can never use *higher* rates than the AP supports
Feb 22 14:59:31 <randomxusr>	derp. ok. I was using the Adapter as an AP. Android devices were cool with that, but iOS told me to get lost
Feb 22 15:00:21 <grawity>	if it's an AP, iirc the interface needs to be 'down' to be reconfigured
Feb 22 15:00:47 <grawity>	but that doesn't sound like the problem for ios
Feb 22 15:00:55 <MrElendig>	and you set the bw in the hostap config
Feb 22 15:01:14 <randomxusr>	yes. Did that. Thought maybe a module would be interfering, but that wouldn't make sense because I thought iwlwifi needs to be loaded to interact with the settings
Feb 22 15:01:39 <randomxusr>	MrElendig, I'm sorry.. BW?
Feb 22 15:01:47 <MrElendig>	bandwidth
Feb 22 15:01:52 <MrElendig>	aka channel width
Feb 22 15:02:08 <randomxusr>	yes, to bg
Feb 22 15:02:26 <randomxusr>	not using a file. I did this all through nmcli commands
Feb 22 15:03:00 <grawity>	bg sounds like the 2.4 GHz band setting, not the channel width setting
Feb 22 15:03:13 <MrElendig>	can't remember the option for channel width in nmcli
Feb 22 15:03:29 <grawity>	doesn't look like it has one
Feb 22 15:03:57 <grawity>	NM confuses me, it sets up the AP through wpa_supplicant instead of hostapd?
Feb 22 15:03:57 <MrElendig>	and of course, it depends on just what channel you are using
Feb 22 15:04:02 <randomxusr>	Looks like set channel
Feb 22 15:04:05 <MrElendig>	and wich cird region you are in
Feb 22 15:04:16 <grawity>	(I know it's 80% the same program, but I didn't know wpa_supplicant had the AP features in it)
Feb 22 15:04:18 <randomxusr>	US
Feb 22 15:05:04 <MrElendig>	in US you can use 40MHz channel 1, 4 and 6 iirc 
Feb 22 15:05:04 <randomxusr>	I don't know entirely what's supported. Tried using hostapd but that was a hot mess of options that may or may not work atm.
Feb 22 15:06:15 <randomxusr>	I'll like need to sit down and work out the commands, wpa_supplicant, and iwlwifi to ensure I know what's supported with which user tools, and just document it.  I get lost in all the available options for wifi
Feb 22 15:06:17 <MrElendig>	technically 1-6
Feb 22 15:08:09 <randomxusr>	and btw, setting up the hotspot in the NM applet failed to set the security options correctly. So even my droid devices didn't work until I manually set the Alg, and type.....
Feb 22 15:09:09 <nathan>	oh u
Feb 22 15:09:34 <nathan>	oops wrong channel

Feb 22 19:14:25 <edu4rdshl>	Well, copy and paste it
Feb 22 19:14:28 <HumbleGuy>	is there a log location like /var/log/pacman
Feb 22 19:14:33 <edu4rdshl>	Also, what's the output of `archlinux-java status`
Feb 22 19:15:34 <HumbleGuy>	https://0x0.st/H51V.txt
Feb 22 19:15:53 <HumbleGuy>	Available Java environments:
Feb 22 19:15:53 <HumbleGuy>	  java-11-openjdk
Feb 22 19:15:54 <HumbleGuy>	  java-17-openjdk
Feb 22 19:15:54 <HumbleGuy>	  java-21-openjdk (default)
Feb 22 19:16:29 <edu4rdshl>	archlinux-java set java-17-openjdk
Feb 22 19:16:35 <edu4rdshl>	And try to build again
Feb 22 19:17:11 <HumbleGuy>	after installing the package can I set it up to 21 again?
Feb 22 19:17:20 <HumbleGuy>	because its the latest and should be the best
Feb 22 19:17:35 <edu4rdshl>	If the package only works with a specific version then no
Feb 22 19:17:44 <edu4rdshl>	I mean, yes, you can, but it will not work
Feb 22 19:18:01 <edu4rdshl>	Also "the best" isn't always the latest, "the best" is the one that works
Feb 22 19:18:22 <HumbleGuy>	then how to actually solve the issue, half he of the java packages that might not work
Feb 22 19:18:31 <HumbleGuy>	because some require 17 and some 21
Feb 22 19:20:32 <hmw[at]>	I never figured out, what I am doing wrong in regards to themes (Mate). Some always fail to render correctly, others randomly render well or not, and with every setup it seems a bit different too. I hope you can tell me, which subsystems I should study in order to master theming my windows and controls. 
Feb 22 19:23:33 <hmw[at]>	(Example of a weird phenomenon: I played with the theme settings on my old setup, and now I can't go back fully. There is a 1px gap between title bar and window that won't go away)
Feb 22 19:30:01 <edu4rdshl>	hmw[at], first make it build
Feb 22 19:30:06 <edu4rdshl>	HumbleGuy, ^
Feb 22 19:30:57 <HumbleGuy>	edu4rdshl what deos that mean?
Feb 22 19:31:38 <edu4rdshl>	That focus on making it build first :)
Feb 22 19:45:52 <eru>	i have two monitor i dont want the cursor to go "smoothly" from one monitor to the other , i want it to have stick to the edge of the screen and go to the next screen only when i quickly move it or something .. is there something for that?
Feb 22 19:46:12 <edu4rdshl>	Depends on your DE
Feb 22 19:46:17 <eru>	i3
Feb 22 19:46:35 <eru>	whats the google-able term for this ?
Feb 22 19:47:38 <edu4rdshl>	cursor screen edge resistance
Feb 22 19:47:42 <edu4rdshl>	Or something like that
Feb 22 19:56:49 <rgallaispou>	Hi, is there any python experts here ?
Feb 22 19:56:51 <rgallaispou>	My pip configuration is managed by pacman. When I install the python-dt-schema package from AUR, it appears broken (ModuleNotFoundError). But in a virtual environment and installed from pip repositories, it works fine. I suspect my python environment variable PYTHONENV faulty.
Feb 22 19:57:36 <teraflops>	I thought you cannot use pip to install things anymore
Feb 22 19:57:57 <teraflops>	ah virtualenv, nvm
Feb 22 19:58:26 <madprops>	why did arch do this change?
Feb 22 19:58:27 <gromit>	rgallaispou: what do you have PYTHONENV set to? Does it work when you unset the var?
Feb 22 19:58:56 <gehidore>	I've never seen the cursor get stuck in i3 when moving between physical monitors
Feb 22 19:58:58 <teraflops>	madprops: iirc the change was upstream, not an arch decision 
Feb 22 19:59:02 <rgallaispou>	gromit: I do not set it in my environment. It takes the default
Feb 22 19:59:07 <gehidore>	but I haven't used i3 in like a year
Feb 22 19:59:10 <gehidore>	or more?
Feb 22 19:59:19 <rgallaispou>	$ python -c "import sys; print(':'.join(sys.path))" 
Feb 22 19:59:21 <rgallaispou>	:/usr/lib/python311.zip:/usr/lib/python3.11:/usr/lib/python3.11/lib-dynload:/home/raphael/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages:/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages
Feb 22 19:59:39 <astralc>	gehidore: unaligned screens? resolution/sizes/rotation?
Feb 22 20:00:42 <gehidore>	their description didn't sound like that but perhaps?
Feb 22 20:00:51 <gehidore>	oh you joined after they said their bit
Feb 22 20:01:11 <rgallaispou>	gromit: oh wait, when I set it in my shell and put the last path as the first one it works ! why ?
Feb 22 20:01:12 <gehidore>	"<eru> i have two monitor i dont want the cursor to go "smoothly" from one monitor to the other , i want it to have stick to the edge of the screen and go to the next screen only when i quickly move it or something .. is there something for that?"
Feb 22 20:01:28 <astralc>	I joined after
Feb 22 20:03:56 <rgallaispou>	gromit: Do you know how to change the default order without setting it in the shell ?
Feb 22 20:04:25 <rgallaispou>	As an environment variable I mean
Feb 22 20:04:52 <astralc>	rgallaispou: you have .local/lib in the path, maybe it cause issues?
Feb 22 20:04:59 <teraflops>	~/.local/lib/python3.11 sounds like pip install --user
Feb 22 20:06:35 <gromit>	rgallaispou: Whyts in the "/home/raphael/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages" folder? 
Feb 22 20:11:33 <rgallaispou>	astralc, teraflops, gromit: there is some packages. I actually don't remember how they got here. Should I delete them and reinstall via my pacman wrapper ?
Feb 22 20:12:06 <rgallaispou>	Will this change the Python path ?
Feb 22 20:12:57 <gromit>	rgallaispou: I mean this could be two problems: You have manually installed python modules and maybe the python-dt-schema schema is just missing deps 🤷
Feb 22 20:13:34 <gromit>	I'd first remove the mdules in ~/.local and then see if the error persists
Feb 22 20:14:14 <astralc>	maybe the ModuleNotFound is coming from module loaded from .local, not directly dt-schema
Feb 22 20:32:31 <rgallaispou>	gromit, astralc: Okay I'll try this in a moment. I'll tell if it worked, thanks

Feb 22 21:17:46 <edu4rdshl>	"but it doesnt nearly have the same amount of packages" - then that's false, if it pull packages from pip registry then the amount of packages is the same
Feb 22 21:19:36 <Voidwarped>	hey
Feb 22 21:19:57 <Voidwarped>	is kernel 6.1-longterm available in arch?
Feb 22 21:20:07 <Voidwarped>	there is a linux-lts package it seems to be 6.6 only
Feb 22 21:20:30 <NetSysFire>	fairly sure it was deprecated by 6.6. might be in the archive. why do you need it?
Feb 22 21:20:32 <NetSysFire>	!ala
Feb 22 21:20:33 <phrik>	Let's flip through it to hunt our lovely bugs: <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux_Archive>. The Arch Linux Archive itself can be browsed at <https://archive.archlinux.org/>.
Feb 22 21:21:41 <astralc>	and in aur
Feb 22 21:22:23 <Voidwarped>	NetSysFire i am having a bug in the latest stable kernel in opensuse (gdm & gnome, relating to i915 intel driver, which is fixed by nomodeset only) https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1220223
Feb 22 21:22:27 <phrik>	Title: 1220223 – Screen flashing before and after GDM login on Iris Xe Graphics (at bugzilla.opensuse.org)
Feb 22 21:22:41 <Voidwarped>	this issue didnt exist in debian stable, which uses 6.1-longterm kernel
Feb 22 21:22:48 <NetSysFire>	in that case, use the archive. however:
Feb 22 21:22:53 <Voidwarped>	i havent tried any other kernels, so 6.6 might or might not work
Feb 22 21:22:58 <NetSysFire>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel#Debugging_regressions
Feb 22 21:22:59 <phrik>	Title: Kernel - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Feb 22 21:23:32 <NetSysFire>	if its already fixed in mainline you dont need to flip through 50 kernel versions to find the offending one and save a lot of time
Feb 22 21:24:38 <Voidwarped>	NetSysFire i haven't tried the mainline yet (in tumbleweed they offer only stable i think), so i will go for arch for now
Feb 22 21:25:04 <NetSysFire>	i highly recommend trying mainline because if its fixed you just need to wait for an eventual backport
Feb 22 21:25:21 <Voidwarped>	my one issue with arch, is that secure boot seems complicated to enable. Normally i disable this, but i want to install on a company laptop, and i am not sure if this is considered opening up vulnerabilities
Feb 22 21:26:26 <NetSysFire>	its not. try sbctl, its easy. plus secure boot helps against local evil maid-style attacks onky
Feb 22 21:26:36 <rgallaispou>	gromit, astralc : It worked ! Thanks :)
Feb 22 21:26:54 <Voidwarped>	i have been told that some malware have been signed anyway, so it doesnt protect against anything
Feb 22 21:26:57 <Voidwarped>	but not sure :D
Feb 22 21:27:57 <NetSysFire>	first i'd try if its fixed at all, then you can look into secureboot
Feb 22 21:28:21 <Voidwarped>	i can use 6.1-lts as a last resort
Feb 22 21:28:21 <rgallaispou>	bluetail: I used a tmp environment when debugging. with $(python -m venv /tmp/venv)
Feb 22 21:29:01 <Repentinus>	NetSysFire, secure boot helps against rootkit installations via remote code execution vulnerabilities too.
Feb 22 21:29:14 <Repentinus>	Not only local evil maid attacks.
Feb 22 21:30:57 <Voidwarped>	i have two questions in regards to installation, since i havent used arch for a while. Am i advised against using that new script installer in the iso? Is there a way to configure btrfs style snapshots, with snapper and grub menu entries (the way opensuse does it) via script or possibly this installer?
Feb 22 21:32:23 <bluetail>	used to be that way
Feb 22 21:32:27 <Repentinus>	Voidwarped, yes, unless you are very familiar with what the script does.
Feb 22 21:32:31 <bluetail>	archinstall is no more a "bad thing"
Feb 22 21:32:52 <Repentinus>	The wiki should also have a guide for triggering btrfs snapshots via pacman hooks.
Feb 22 21:33:21 <Voidwarped>	i have done the arch install procedure manually a number of times, and automating it would be nice. Havent looked into what the script does though
Feb 22 21:34:16 <NetSysFire>	thats the issue: in the end something doesnt work and it might be because archinstall did something unexpected
Feb 22 21:35:12 <Voidwarped>	does it configure btrfs? cause i trust the installer more than me in that (haven't done that manually yet)
Feb 22 21:37:00 <bluetail>	yes
Feb 22 21:37:06 <thingfish>	I can tell you the installer will allow you to choose btrfs and will offer to create subvolumes for you.
Feb 22 21:37:24 <Voidwarped>	thats good, because i have no clue on btrfs, or what subvolumes to create etc
Feb 22 21:37:27 <bluetail>	there are evend desktop profiles
Feb 22 21:37:33 <bluetail>	e.g to choose a desktop environment
Feb 22 21:37:53 <Voidwarped>	i want to set up, sway, with pipewire, and btrfs+snapper
Feb 22 21:38:11 <astralc>	I'm not sure the installer have snapper support
Feb 22 21:38:18 <astralc>	as part of the install
Feb 22 21:38:19 <Voidwarped>	i can do that part manually
Feb 22 21:38:37 <Voidwarped>	the hook is simple to enable as i remember, and the modified grub
Feb 22 21:39:43 <astralc>	but you need to create the snapshots dir, and the config for snapper?
Feb 22 21:40:06 <Voidwarped>	the installer doesnt create a snapshots subvolume?
Feb 22 21:41:50 <NetSysFire>	see? thats what i mean with "archinstall may do unexpected things"
Feb 22 21:53:55 <Voidwarped>	NetSysFire it makes a snasphot subvolume
Feb 22 21:54:10 <Voidwarped>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/snapper#Creating_a_new_configuration
Feb 22 21:54:11 <phrik>	Title: Snapper - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Feb 22 21:54:29 <Voidwarped>	there is a note here, how to make snapper work on the subvolume the archinstaller creates
Feb 22 21:55:07 <Voidwarped>	i will go with the archinstaller and do the rest, since i am not familiar with setting up btrfs, or what the partioning scheme is, and i don't want to research it now, will learn by using it
Feb 22 22:00:42 <sinbad>	Is there a way to pass the names of packages operated on by pacman to pacman hooks?
Feb 22 22:02:09 <edu4rdshl>	Target= ?
Feb 22 22:02:39 <edu4rdshl>	See  `man alpm-hooks`
Feb 22 22:08:15 <sinbad>	edu4rdshl: No, the other way around. I have just found it: NeedsTarget causes to pass a list of packages to stdin of the hook script.
Feb 22 22:50:11 <Voidwarper>	The uefi boot menu shows two entries of my archlinux USB 
Feb 22 22:50:23 <Voidwarper>	0 and 1, both seem to boot 
Feb 22 22:50:41 <Voidwarper>	What is this about? Does it make a difference in something 
Feb 22 22:51:13 <Voidwarper>	I don't know if it refers to the two partitions of the USB, or it means the whole device and partition 1
Feb 22 22:53:08 <edu4rdshl>	What does the entry description says
Feb 22 22:53:35 <Voidwarper>	UEFI Wilk USB
Feb 22 22:53:56 <Voidwarper>	900038DD4
Feb 22 22:54:08 <Voidwarper>	And uefi Wilk USB 
Feb 22 22:54:14 <Voidwarper>	900038DD4 2
Feb 22 22:54:26 <Voidwarper>	It has a space and 2 at the end of the same string 
Feb 22 22:54:51 <Voidwarper>	Both seem to boot the iso
Feb 22 22:55:32 <Voidwarper>	Those are under, uefi boot devices if I press f12
Feb 22 22:58:35 <dandels>	Voidwarper: I'm under the impression the BIOS/UEFI might show an entry both for the partition and the disk
Feb 22 22:58:52 <dandels>	s/disk/drive
Feb 22 22:59:00 <Voidwarper>	which one do I want? 
Feb 22 22:59:05 <Voidwarper>	Or it doesn't matter 
Feb 22 22:59:20 <dandels>	if it boots into uefi mode it doesn't matter. the installation guide has instructions for it
Feb 22 23:00:03 <dandels>	Instructions for checking which one you booted into*. Sorry, just about to go to sleep :D
Feb 22 23:13:01 <edu4rdshl>	Voidwarper, what do you created that USD with?
Feb 22 23:13:04 <edu4rdshl>	USB*
Feb 22 23:13:25 <Voidwarper>	I only know how to use dd
Feb 23 00:18:02 <cloudowind>	do i need to have the same distro for master domain controller and secondery domain contoller , is it ok to have 3 different distros for master dc secondery dc and a file server , if all different am i going to have issues? maybe i should ask this in #samva 
Feb 23 00:18:35 <cloudowind>	mybe just do it an see myself :/
Feb 23 00:18:46 <hackfoo>	cloudowind: tias, sure, but I'd worry about having differing samba versions.
Feb 23 00:19:42 <cloudowind>	ok thank you i will keep that in mind
Feb 23 00:37:30 <Voidwarper>	Is there a way to use Linux 6.1lts?
Feb 23 00:37:39 <Voidwarper>	There doesn't seem to be a package 
Feb 23 00:38:07 <NetSysFire>	we told you before, use the arch linux archive
Feb 23 00:38:18 <Namarrgon>	there is no official 6.1 kernel in the repos but you can check the AUR for a PKGBUILD
Feb 23 00:38:46 <Namarrgon>	the ala might be a temporary fix, but not something you can rely on long-term
Feb 23 00:39:05 *	Namarrgon hasn't read the backlog
Feb 23 00:39:37 <NetSysFire>	its for debugging a regression in i915
Feb 23 00:40:04 <NetSysFire>	i already told them to properly debug it via https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel#Debugging_regressions and to use the mainline kernel, so if its already fixed there they only need to wait for an eventual backport
Feb 23 00:40:05 <phrik>	Title: Kernel - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Feb 23 00:40:07 <Namarrgon>	which version regressed? 6.2?
Feb 23 00:41:14 <Voidwarper>	NetSysFire by mainline you mean the package linux? 
Feb 23 00:41:22 <Voidwarper>	Isn't this the stable one 
Feb 23 00:41:23 <NetSysFire>	read the section i linked
Feb 23 00:41:40 <NetSysFire>	Namarrgon: i think it was a vague range from 6.1 to 6.6 with tested kernels being a debian one and opensuse, so patches causing problems isnt impossible
Feb 23 00:43:28 <Namarrgon>	can't be that many commits between 6.1 and 6.6, right?
Feb 23 00:43:39 <NetSysFire>	dont make me count them
Feb 23 00:52:22 <Voidwarper>	I will have to find a pre-built mainline 
Feb 23 00:52:59 <Voidwarper>	From the download the repo is huge 
Feb 23 01:01:24 <Voidwarper>	Chaotic aur ftw. Found it precompiled and with v3 optimization 
Feb 23 01:03:55 <NetSysFire>	yes, the note says theres a stickied comment with prebuilt kernels
Feb 23 01:16:12 <Voidwarper>	Mainline also has this issue with Intel GPU 
Feb 23 01:19:15 <Voidwarper>	So this issue isn't getting solved any time soon 
Feb 23 01:19:44 <Scimmia>	not if you don't debug it, no
Feb 23 01:20:02 <Voidwarper>	You mean find the commit that broke it? 
Feb 23 01:21:16 <Namarrgon>	that would help a lot
Feb 23 01:23:44 <davispuh>	does anyone know why we're stuck with Ruby 3.0 ? 3.3 is already out... and Ruby package was flagged out of date while ago 
Feb 23 01:28:25 <zeratul>	how do I add a folder to $PATH ?
Feb 23 01:29:28 <Namarrgon>	what are you trying to do?
Feb 23 01:30:56 <zeratul>	nvm
Feb 23 01:33:07 <cloudowind>	secret 
Feb 23 01:33:18 <mefistofeles>	secret secret, I got a secret
Feb 23 01:33:36 <Voidwarper>	Secret secret Intel iris sucks
Feb 23 01:34:37 <Voidwarper>	I thought Intel igpu was the best supported out of the box in Linux 
Feb 23 01:34:51 <Voidwarper>	In comparison to amd etc 
Feb 23 01:35:54 <Scimmia>	both are. nvidia is the exception
Feb 23 01:36:01 <Namarrgon>	what was the problem again?
Feb 23 01:36:31 <Namarrgon>	ah, nvm, you switched nicks, i see it now
Feb 23 01:37:13 <Namarrgon>	so this is just about the screen flashing before and after gdm?
Feb 23 01:37:28 <Namarrgon>	everything else is fine?
Feb 23 01:37:31 <Voidwarper>	My screen randomly blanks, on tty, and on gdm login. I tried mainline, stable, 6.6lts. Only 6.1lts I think worked will test it again. Setting nomodeset solved it but I lose GPU acceleration 
Feb 23 01:37:50 <Voidwarper>	It blanks at random points also while in gnome shell, or in try 
Feb 23 01:38:14 <Namarrgon>	is it limited to wayland or does it happen with x11 too?
Feb 23 01:38:50 <Voidwarper>	Good question. Let me see. My tests yesterday showed x11 worked fine 
Feb 23 01:39:25 <Voidwarper>	But I didn't test that long. Also today I had tty also blank which doesn't use Wayland 
Feb 23 01:39:31 <Namarrgon>	do you get any output in the kernel log when the flashing happens?
Feb 23 01:40:04 *	cloudowind watching how Namarrgon is narrowing the issue 
Feb 23 01:40:16 <Namarrgon>	secret!
Feb 23 01:43:09 <Voidwarper>	I don't see anything weird in journalctl or dmesg
Feb 23 01:43:35 <Namarrgon>	nothing in that time period at all?
Feb 23 01:43:49 <Voidwarper>	No
Feb 23 01:44:47 <cloudowind>	gdm logs? if gdm generates internal  erros will those be on dmesg  too?
Feb 23 01:47:11 <Voidwarper>	Fd
Feb 23 01:47:12 <Voidwarper>	F
Feb 23 01:47:50 <Voidwarper>	Gdm mentions something about Pam unable to open pam_gnome_keyring.so
Feb 23 01:47:57 <Voidwarper>	But I don't think it's related

Feb 23 02:04:37 <Nuc1eoN>	Greetings for some reason my locale is not properly set. I have uncommented en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 in /etc/locale.gen and run locale-gen, but this is the output of `locale`:

Feb 23 02:06:23 <Namarrgon>	is de_DE.UTF-8 built as well?

Feb 23 02:08:41 <Namarrgon>	remove that file, relogin and never touch kde's localization settings again
Feb 23 02:08:46 <Nuc1eoN>	hah
Feb 23 02:08:49 <Nuc1eoN>	lol ok
Feb 23 02:08:50 <Namarrgon>	this part of kde is defective
Feb 23 02:08:55 <Nuc1eoN>	I am gonna do that ty
Feb 23 02:09:02 <Nuc1eoN>	Oh I see
Feb 23 02:09:14 <Nuc1eoN>	YEah too much automagick bs I guess :)
Feb 23 02:09:18 <espresso>	i do the same on KDE :)
Feb 23 02:09:32 <Nuc1eoN>	espresso you delete the file? :p
Feb 23 02:09:50 <Namarrgon>	i don't know how this started but it's been going on for decades, i assume it's by design
Feb 23 02:09:54 <espresso>	I do not think I ever had it, but I try to do it all manually
Feb 23 02:10:38 <Nuc1eoN>	Namarrgon, is there even a bug report for this or something? :p Or is it just a generally accepted bug by now? >p
Feb 23 02:10:43 <espresso>	I tried settings sometimes and it worked, but if I already do it manually, no need
Feb 23 02:11:00 <Namarrgon>	Nuc1eoN: i don't remember, i have accepted it as part of kde's core identity
Feb 23 02:11:28 <Nuc1eoN>	sounds great :)
Feb 23 02:13:01 <Nuc1eoN>	Namarrgon, nice! The error is gone. LC_ALL= is still empty, is that expected?
Feb 23 02:13:26 <Namarrgon>	it's a debug setting and should stay empty for daily use
Feb 23 02:13:30 <espresso>	Nuc1eoN: that is the case here.
Feb 23 02:13:47 <Nuc1eoN>	Ok good to know
Feb 23 02:13:49 <Namarrgon>	but you shouldn't get that "locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory"
Feb 23 02:14:20 <Nuc1eoN>	Namarrgon, naah thats gone :) Also some apps had trouble and would not start. Now it's fine
Feb 23 02:14:46 <Nuc1eoN>	Only my the clock in plasma shows in US or GB format now :p
Feb 23 02:15:07 <Nuc1eoN>	Not sure if that is fixable in that case
Feb 23 02:15:24 <Nuc1eoN>	Usually I have it set to german time/ date layout
Feb 23 02:16:05 <Namarrgon>	if de_DE is your "native" locale then it might be simpler to set LANG to de_DE and only override LC_MESSAGES or whatever you need
Feb 23 02:16:31 <espresso>	I set LC_TIME=sv_SE.UTF-8 in ~/.config/locale.conf .. Also, I think KDE's clock options should be independent?
Feb 23 02:17:32 <Nuc1eoN>	Namarrgon, I am using english for language of my system. German often has bad translations and it's more difficult to follow online guides. Only the US time/date formatting trips me up heh
Feb 23 02:18:08 <Namarrgon>	yeah, all you need for translations is to set LC_MESSAGES to en_US
Feb 23 02:18:48 <Nuc1eoN>	Namarrgon, good idea. Do I set LC_MESSAGES in ~/.config/locale.conf ?
Feb 23 02:19:09 <Namarrgon>	i do in /etc/locale.conf but it's up to you if you want it system-wide or per-user
Feb 23 02:20:03 <Nuc1eoN>	Thanks, that helps a bunch
Feb 23 02:20:50 *	espresso goes system-wide
Feb 23 02:21:32 <Nuc1eoN>	Is it known how plasma-localerc actually leads to this error (locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory) ?
Feb 23 02:21:49 <Namarrgon>	it's just dreaming up locales that do not exist
Feb 23 02:21:59 <Nuc1eoN>	:DD
Feb 23 02:22:21 <Nuc1eoN>	Maybe it uses AI :p
Feb 23 02:23:01 <espresso>	Nuc1eoN: The error showed up on Arch forum (I guess user had not run locale-gen) and some using debian. Did not find it currently on https://bugs.kde.org/

Feb 23 02:26:23 <Nuc1eoN>	Did some testing, setting only LC_TIME=de_DE.UTF-8 indeed "fixes" the plasma clock to be german layout. So no need to configure it in plasma luckily.

Feb 23 03:55:42 <espresso>	d3Xt3r: maybe so, yes
Feb 23 04:03:05 <nullstring>	so I am trying to boot to a nvme disk, but the motherboard is too old to support booting directly to it.
Feb 23 04:03:18 <nullstring>	grub doesn't seem to detect it either
Feb 23 04:03:35 <nullstring>	is there some grub module I need to install or something or any thoughts?
Feb 23 04:05:09 <virtualsid>	quick search seems like maybe not. But no chance a bios update adds that support in?
Feb 23 04:07:42 <d3Xt3r>	nullaffinity: It appears that rEFInd can do it, but you'll need to install it to a different drive which *can* be booted by your BIOS. You may need to also install clover-efi, if you want to boot the drive in UEFI mode.
Feb 23 04:08:10 <espresso>	could possibly use a PCIe adapter, or put the bootloader on a bootable drive and add grub entry
Feb 23 04:08:58 <espresso>	*to boot from the nvme

Feb 23 09:31:49 <chovy>	ok thanks
Feb 23 10:04:45 <Zta>	I've got a super weird problem, and I don't know what to do with it.  Also because I've found a work-around.  But in short: The combination of linux-zen kernel + docker + mssql container makes that mssql app crash horribly within the container with stacktrace and what not.  I've not seen anything like it ever.  What makes this interesting is that it's a containerized (Microsoft!) app that aparrently is affected by kernel version. 
Feb 23 10:05:23 <Zta>	I've removed the linux-zen kernel from my system, so now everything works.  But geesh this took some time to identify. 
Feb 23 10:08:07 <Zta>	But it bothers me that I don't have an exact explanation of why this happens.  I'm utterly baffled by this.
Feb 23 10:15:48 <chovy>	what is the linux-zen kernel?
Feb 23 10:29:13 <Carbon_Monoxide>	dagle: I'm not sure if those are x11 windows or not. vscode, signal-desktop, element-desktop are all having this invisbility issue.
Feb 23 10:30:34 <Carbon_Monoxide>	I tried to launch QT5 Settings. And it's also having this issue.
Feb 23 10:34:27 <dagle>	Carbon_Monoxide: What does xlsclients say?
Feb 23 10:34:45 <dagle>	Also are the programs running but not showing?
Feb 23 10:35:01 <Carbon_Monoxide>	Sorry, how do I check xlsclients?
Feb 23 10:35:52 <dagle>	It's a terminal command that you can install.
Feb 23 10:35:56 <Carbon_Monoxide>	Yes, those are running but just not showing. I'm using Gnome. So when I use shortcut to show all windows. I can see those invisible windows and can close them using the cross icon.
Feb 23 10:36:23 <dagle>	xlsclients gives you a list of x11 windows running on your computer.

Feb 23 12:24:13 <virtualsid>	quick search seems to show shift-f3?
Feb 23 12:27:46 <docmax>	yes, i must have done wrong google searches
Feb 23 12:29:57 <charlie5>	hi all ... i have some text files with a specific suffix ('.snippet') which i would like to be grouped together in thunar, rather than having them grouped with all text files ... any clues how to do this ?
Feb 23 12:30:22 <charlie5>	(when thunar is ordering by file type)
Feb 23 12:39:56 <mkoskar>	charlie5: can you sort by file extension?
Feb 23 12:42:24 <charlie5>	mkoskar: thunar only appears to group by file 'type', rather than the actual extension
Feb 23 12:42:50 <charlie5>	it sees that the .snippet files are text and so groups them with other text files
Feb 23 12:43:06 <mkoskar>	oh well ┐(ツ)┌
Feb 23 12:43:12 <charlie5>	:)
Feb 23 12:43:15 <mkoskar>	use smt else then
Feb 23 12:44:16 <mkoskar>	I don't use gui file managers often but when I do I use caja lately, seems ok
Feb 23 12:44:33 <charlie5>	i think i need to add a newe mmime type
Feb 23 12:44:36 <charlie5>	mime
Feb 23 12:47:58 <virtualsid>	huh. I just realised that everything in Arch is in /usr/bin, all the others (/bin, /sbin, /usr/sbin) go to /usr/bin. Is that an Arch specific thing, or the new standard in linux?

Feb 23 15:04:09 <MrElendig>	kinda wish proxmox would use ubuntu as a base, but its mostly fine
Feb 23 15:04:54 <MrElendig>	at least they sometimes ship their own newer kernel so its almost usable on modern hardwre a bit more often than vanilla debian
Feb 23 15:05:49 <docdrow>	regardless I suspect proxmox will see a huge increase in subscriptions
Feb 23 15:05:51 <katia>	my debian installs are on 6.1, is that not modern enough?
Feb 23 15:05:52 <docdrow>	probably are already
Feb 23 15:06:11 <docdrow>	Broadcom has made so many VMware customers angry
Feb 23 15:06:12 <MrElendig>	katia: go back not that long ago and debian was on 5.15
Feb 23 15:06:32 <MrElendig>	katia: proxmox ended up shipping their own 6.1 kernel
Feb 23 15:06:44 <docdrow>	lots of really good stuff in 6.8 and 6.9 for modern AMD systems
Feb 23 15:06:46 <katia>	yeah i supppose bookworm's recent
Feb 23 15:09:19 <lmat>	One computer on my network isn't able to resolve *A* DNS name. It can resolve several, but there is one on my local network that it can't resolve. Other machines on my network can resolve it and this machine can resolve other DNS names on this network.
Feb 23 15:09:40 <lmat>	I have pfsense running on this network with several static DHCP assignments, and pfsense acts as a DNS server for those machines.
Feb 23 15:09:56 <MacGyver>	lmat: What is it using to resolve?
Feb 23 15:10:16 <docdrow>	lmat: smells like a subdomain search config issue.....
Feb 23 15:10:24 <MacGyver>	lmat: As in, have you been able to observe the request for resolution it sends into the network?
Feb 23 15:10:26 <lmat>	MacGyver: systemd-resolved...
Feb 23 15:10:26 <MrElendig>	lmat: if local caching, flush it
Feb 23 15:10:33 <lmat>	okay, I'll try that!
Feb 23 15:10:49 <MacGyver>	But MrElendig's suggestion is probably quicker and easier.
Feb 23 15:10:55 <MrElendig>	resovectl flush-caches
Feb 23 15:11:04 <MrElendig>	resolvectl*
Feb 23 15:11:16 <docdrow>	lmat: you can always "tcpdump -i insideinterface udp port 53" on your pfsense box -- see what question your box is asking your dns
Feb 23 15:11:50 <MacGyver>	docdrow: See my question is more "Is your box even asking the pfsense box in the first place, or is it doing something else?"
Feb 23 15:11:51 <lmat>	MrElendig: I did sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
Feb 23 15:11:54 <docdrow>	ops, you probably would need: tcpdump -i insideinterface udp port 53 and host ip.addr.of.box
Feb 23 15:12:05 <MrElendig>	lmat: resolvectl query thehostname
Feb 23 15:12:47 <Midjak>	Hello I am upgrading my system right now and I get an error about chromium which seems corrupted. My keyring is up to date and I tried several time to download with the same error. Is there an on going issue for this package ?
Feb 23 15:12:48 <docdrow>	MacGyver: yea for sure a good step
Feb 23 15:13:02 <MrElendig>	also, fqdn or using search domain?
Feb 23 15:13:09 <lmat>	MrElendig: "polycarp: 'polycarp' not found"  but on another archlinux machine on the network, "polycarp: 10.23.4.23..."
Feb 23 15:13:24 <MrElendig>	lmat: search domain is not enabled by default
Feb 23 15:13:26 <lmat>	Ah, fqdn works!
Feb 23 15:13:33 <docdrow>	lmat: smells like a subdomain search config issue..... :-)
Feb 23 15:14:06 <MrElendig>	Domains=whatever  in the config
Feb 23 15:14:16 <docdrow>	[DHCP]
Feb 23 15:14:18 <docdrow>	UseDomains=true
Feb 23 15:14:28 <docdrow>	(assuming your DHCP server is assigning the correct search domains)
Feb 23 15:14:29 <Namarrgon>	Midjak: what is the exact error?
Feb 23 15:15:00 <masterkorp>	Hello, has any of you get got a dual screen foldable usb display working on linux ? 
Feb 23 15:15:38 <MrElendig>	masterkorp: displaylink?
Feb 23 15:15:42 <masterkorp>	yes
Feb 23 15:15:46 <masterkorp>	I have it running
Feb 23 15:15:46 <MrElendig>	if so, good luck, that stuff is broken af
Feb 23 15:15:53 <Midjak>	"invalid or corrupted" package Namarrgon 
Feb 23 15:16:00 <masterkorp>	its works nicely on my usb dock 
Feb 23 15:16:02 <MrElendig>	Midjak: full exact error
Feb 23 15:16:07 <Namarrgon>	Midjak: that's the less important part
Feb 23 15:16:09 <masterkorp>	which then I have 2 screens connected
Feb 23 15:16:11 <docdrow>	foldable portable screen is on my wish list :)
Feb 23 15:16:22 <masterkorp>	Man, its so nice for mobile working
Feb 23 15:16:31 <masterkorp>	but on linux I can only get 1 screen working 
Feb 23 15:16:33 <MacGyver>	All screens are foldable if you try hard enough.
Feb 23 15:16:34 <Midjak>	I need to ssh to my device
Feb 23 15:17:06 <Namarrgon>	we'll wait
Feb 23 15:18:23 <lmat>	docdrow: I added [DHCP] UseDomains=true  and restarted systemd-resolved but resolvectl query <name>; still doesn't work. How can I tell if pfsense is assigning correct search domains?

Feb 23 15:18:59 <phrik>	Title: View paste RAVIO (at bpa.st)
Feb 23 15:19:17 <docdrow>	lmat: your other devices that resolve correctly -- do they have a statically assigned search suffix ?? like in /etc/resolv.conf perhaps?
Feb 23 15:19:45 <lmat>	docdrow: I haven't configured anything like that. I'll check that conf...
Feb 23 15:20:01 <docdrow>	lmat: also you added that UseDomains=true in the [DHCP] section of your /etc/systemd/network/whatever.network file?
Feb 23 15:20:10 <lmat>	docdrow: It's there! "Generated by dhcpcd..."
Feb 23 15:20:26 <lmat>	docdrow: Okay, added UseDomains into the wrong file /o\
Feb 23 15:20:32 <docdrow>	ah
Feb 23 15:20:35 <Namarrgon>	Midjak: pacmna -Q archlinux-keyring
Feb 23 15:20:42 <Midjak>	I trid to upgrade several time the keyring and it seems ok "warning: archlinux-keyring-20240208-1 is up to date -- reinstalling"
Feb 23 15:20:46 <docdrow>	yeah and you'll probably want to do: networkctl reload
Feb 23 15:20:54 <MrElendig>	symlink to resolved else whatever you do to resolvectl won't really matter
Feb 23 15:21:07 <lmat>	docdrow: I guess dhcpcd did some automatic configuration for me, but I don't use it anymore, so I don't get its friendly help either!
Feb 23 15:21:25 <Midjak>	archlinux-keyring 20240208-1
Feb 23 15:21:37 <docdrow>	lmat: systemd-networkd does all that stuff now
Feb 23 15:21:38 <Scimmia>	Midjak: try a different mirror
Feb 23 15:21:49 <docdrow>	if you're using systemd-resolved, make sure your /etc/resolv.conf is linked like this:
Feb 23 15:21:51 <docdrow>	/etc/resolv.conf -> ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
Feb 23 15:21:58 <Midjak>	ok Scimmia 
Feb 23 15:22:09 <Namarrgon>	Midjak: can you post the checksum for the package in the cache first?
Feb 23 15:22:17 <lmat>	docdrow: Manually added to /etc/resolv.conf, systemctl restart systemd-resolved; and then resolvectl query works as expected :-D
Feb 23 15:22:18 <docdrow>	I used to hate resolved but it has since assimilated me
Feb 23 15:22:34 <lmat>	docdrow: I don't know enough to be opinionated ^_^
Feb 23 15:22:37 <docdrow>	lmat: if you're resolv.conf isn't linked as I pasted above, you're not actually using systemd-resolved
Feb 23 15:23:01 <docdrow>	whic his why this probably didnt work
Feb 23 15:23:08 <Midjak>	what package the keyring or chromium the last one is deleted after the error ?
Feb 23 15:23:35 <lmat>	docdrow: Ahh, thanks for the pointer! Yeah, that stub-resolv.conf is not linked, but it does have "search <domain>"!
Feb 23 15:23:39 <docdrow>	so: cd /etc;rm -f resolv.conf;ln -s ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf resolv.conf;systemctl enable --now systemd-resolved
Feb 23 15:23:49 <Namarrgon>	Midjak: chromium but since you already delete it just switch mirrors
Feb 23 15:24:04 <Midjak>	ok thank you
Feb 23 15:24:14 <lmat>	docdrow: Sure. Am I supposed to have done that when I set up my computer for the first time?
Feb 23 15:24:19 <MacGyver>	docdrow: Aside: do you do that because you also always get the order of the files the wrong way around and -sf would accidentally overwrite the wrong one? :P
Feb 23 15:24:31 <docdrow>	lmat: if you want to use systemd's resolver yes
Feb 23 15:24:44 <docdrow>	MacGyver: yes sir ;)
Feb 23 15:24:46 <lmat>	docdrow: Okay, I'll take note!
Feb 23 15:25:41 *	lmat "target name" is the mnemonic ^_^ ("name target" doesn't sound as good)
Feb 23 15:26:51 <docdrow>	lmat: DNS-related options under the [DHCP] section in your whatever.network will have no effect if you're not using systemd's resolver
Feb 23 15:31:26 <Midjak>	Ok there are a lot mirror in France which retruns error on this list but I have found one which work https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=FR&protocol=http&protocol=https&ip_version=4
Feb 23 15:31:48 <Namarrgon>	you don't have to limit yourself to one country
Feb 23 15:32:03 <MrElendig>	and do tick the use mirror status box
Feb 23 15:32:14 <Midjak>	yes I think I going to add one from UK and one from Germeny I think
Feb 23 15:32:59 <Midjak>	this one doesn't work https://mirror.wormhole.eu/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch for instance
Feb 23 15:33:02 <MrElendig>	make sure the first mirror in your list has a reasonable low mirror status score
Feb 23 15:33:58 <Midjak>	in fact at first I tried this methid but it the generated list doesn't work https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/mirrors#Fetching_and_ranking_a_live_mirror_list
Feb 23 15:34:00 <phrik>	Title: Mirrors - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)

Feb 23 15:35:53 <Scimmia>	there is a single Tier 1 mirror in France
Feb 23 15:36:47 <Midjak>	Do you know a good mirror in Europe ?
Feb 23 15:37:16 <Scimmia>	I don't
Feb 23 15:37:56 <Midjak>	ok I am gonna look thanks
Feb 23 15:39:54 <Midjak>	does pacman take the mirrors in the order in which they are entered in the file?

Feb 23 15:43:33 <mefistofeles>	[-_-]: that ne seems to need a license, unlikely
Feb 23 15:43:47 <[-_-]>	just need a pkgbuild

Feb 23 15:44:07 <Aryan>	Scimmia, yes thank you!
Feb 23 15:44:49 <mefistofeles>	[-_-]: but the package files seem to live behind some registration site, that's what I meant
Feb 23 15:45:04 <[-_-]>	ik
Feb 23 15:45:16 <[-_-]>	but but, don't anyone use vasp on arch ?
Feb 23 15:45:23 <mefistofeles>	maybe :/
Feb 23 15:45:30 <[-_-]>	:\
Feb 23 15:45:31 <mefistofeles>	you don't need a PKGBUILD for that
Feb 23 15:47:00 <Scimmia>	[-_-]: so only someone that has a license can make a PKGBUILD, and the chances of someone here having that is small
Feb 23 16:00:33 <[-_-]>	doesn't arch have intel-oneapi-mpi ?
Feb 23 16:04:25 <mefistofeles>	[-_-]: intel's mpi is probably also licensed
Feb 23 16:04:46 <[-_-]>	the whole oneapi stuff is on aur

Feb 23 16:05:32 <mefistofeles>	oh, actually, arch repos!
Feb 23 16:05:33 <mefistofeles>	nice
Feb 23 16:06:13 <mefistofeles>	[-_-]: what you need is probably in the runtime libs pkg

Feb 23 16:49:47 <Porkepix>	Hi! I'd have some questions about things encuntered recently: first since like 1 week to 1 month, AUR packages built from AUR helper also build and create a -debug package, I didn't find that much info but it seems to come from makepkg and not the AUR helper; where can I find more information about it, like why it does that now and what's different in this package? (While for compiled ones I
Feb 23 16:49:49 <Porkepix>	might expect some additional debug symbols, it seems to create it everytime)
Feb 23 16:50:23 <Namarrgon>	the stock makepkg.conf now includes the 'debug' option
Feb 23 16:50:26 <susi>	Porkepix: https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman/-/commit/fcb1d4f87e67f3f6d56ef360302e8d4f8ead27d9

Feb 23 16:50:46 <susi>	oh sorry, might be wrong url
Feb 23 16:51:13 <Porkepix>	Second is about some -git rust packages from AUR which built for very long without any issues, but some of them (not all of them) now have some kind of linking issues I don't really understand, reproduced with both yay and paru but *not* if I manually build the binary with cargo, see these logs: https://mindleaking.org/privatebin/?18565ae99aa8291f#AxPCZuzwkC63BUP62cXB2i4fEFwoWJh5Gau8B56o2MKh

Feb 23 16:52:27 <Porkepix>	Namarrgon: But can I find more information regarding this, to answer the questions I raised?
Feb 23 16:53:22 <Namarrgon>	makepkg.conf from the pacman package is now the same that is used to build official packages
Feb 23 16:53:56 <Scimmia>	including lto

Feb 23 16:56:18 <Porkepix>	Scimmia: lto?
Feb 23 16:56:18 <Namarrgon>	if your packages don't build with 'lto' you might want to disable it per-package or globally
Feb 23 16:57:07 <Namarrgon>	check the AUR comments first, in case the failures aren't related to the makepkg.conf change
Feb 23 16:58:41 <Porkepix>	Namarrgon: Packages aren't that active, no comments on AUR, and I've got the issue on 3 different -git packages. I only built one of them using cargo and it produced no issue. Other -git rust packages got no issue either, so it's only on part of them
Feb 23 16:59:02 <Porkepix>	I don't know what lto is
Feb 23 16:59:18 <Namarrgon>	disable lto for one of the failed PKGBUILDs and see what happens
Feb 23 17:00:50 <susi>	see makepkg.conf about lto
Feb 23 17:16:26 <Porkepix>	So, I'll come back at the -debug after. About the -git packages and lto: it succeed both by removing the option lto or negating it (!lto), is it the same to negate or remove it? Is the issue by having it a makepkg one or an upstream one (especially, I see `    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 2m 07s` at the end of the build if it can be related)?

Feb 23 18:22:11 *	NetSysFire looks at dvzrv
Feb 23 18:23:45 <nullstring>	I have this ssd thats underperforming. In lspci -vv it says this: "                LnkSta: Speed 2.5GT/s (downgraded), Width x4
Feb 23 18:24:10 <Tom^>	NetSysFire: https://www.laborejo.org/fluajho/ seems 404
Feb 23 18:24:10 <nullstring>	Seems.. quite in line with the speeds I am seeing. Anyone have any thoughts on why it's downgraded?
Feb 23 18:24:14 <Tom^>	NetSysFire: :p
Feb 23 18:24:33 <MacGyver>	nullstring: Motherboard PCIe lane layout, PCIe lane number available on the CPU...
Feb 23 18:24:57 <Tom^>	nullstring: hm download link works tho
Feb 23 18:25:01 <Tom^>	NetSysFire: ^
Feb 23 18:26:27 <NetSysFire>	i know its likely abandoned by upstream but i'd like a source for a prettier edit message in the wiki when i am removing it
Feb 23 18:27:14 <nullstring>	MacGyver: HMM it's an Asus P8Z68-V.. I thought it can support 8x/8x/4x. HMMMMM it's like... I have two devices that are getting just one lane of pci gen 2 and another device getting one lane of pci gen 1.. HMMM
Feb 23 18:27:29 <nullstring>	is that a 4x pci-e gen 1 and I didn't realize..
Feb 23 18:27:49 <MacGyver>	nullstring: If it's NVMe I *think* it *has* to be gen3.
Feb 23 18:27:58 <nullstring>	MacGyver: ???
Feb 23 18:28:16 <nullstring>	why?
Feb 23 18:28:24 <MacGyver>	nullstring: I'm not sure NVMe M.2 devices are standardized for PCIe < 3.
Feb 23 18:28:47 <MacGyver>	nullstring: So if they're not, it at minimum has to be running with PCIe gen3.
Feb 23 18:29:21 <nullstring>	yeah I don't think thats right
Feb 23 18:31:26 <MacGyver>	What is this storage hooked up through?
Feb 23 18:31:27 <Vorpal>	I think I found a bug in... Something? Either cpupower or in the kernel I guess: https://0x0.st/H5yv.txt
Feb 23 18:31:44 <MacGyver>	Because afaict the P8Z68-V doesn't have M.2 slots.
Feb 23 18:31:53 <Vorpal>	it thinks I have 32 cores but some are offline?
Feb 23 18:32:38 <Vorpal>	pretty sure that didn't show that just a few months ago (I don't often need to set to a specific frequency like this)
Feb 23 18:32:56 <nullstring>	MacGyver: pcie to m.2 things
Feb 23 18:35:26 <MacGyver>	nullstring: Then that's probably why it's degraded; the motherboard is PCIe gen2 and M.2 needs PCIe3 for for 2.5GT/s operation over 4 lanes.
Feb 23 18:35:49 <MacGyver>	nullstring: It probably *is* getting 4 lanes. They're just not fast enough.
Feb 23 18:35:54 <nullstring>	2.5GT/s is VERY slow
Feb 23 18:36:08 <Vorpal>	hm I still see CPU frequency scaling. What is the correct way to set up an AMD Ryzen system to a fixed frequency (for code benchmarking purposes). It doesn't have to be the fastest setting, as long as it is *stable*
Feb 23 18:36:50 <nullstring>	2.5GT/s is ONE pcie gen 1 lane, unless I am misreading this
Feb 23 18:37:27 <MacGyver>	nullstring: Uh, sorry, messed up GT and GB there -- it's probably running 2.5GT/s fine but the bandwidth per lane on gen2 is 500MB/s at 5GT/s.
Feb 23 18:37:28 <latef_02>	hello guys my date and time always change in my acrch linux everytime i reboot my computer any solujtion please 
Feb 23 18:37:39 <MacGyver>	nullstring: So maybe it even is using the gen1 there.
Feb 23 18:37:50 <nullstring>	right but why?
Feb 23 18:37:54 <MacGyver>	nullstring: Regardless, even in ideal conditions you won't see faster than 2GB/s.
Feb 23 18:38:02 <nullstring>	yeah I am good with 2GB/s
Feb 23 18:38:06 <nullstring>	but I am getting about 500MB/s
Feb 23 18:38:18 <MacGyver>	Okay, well, which slot is that card in?
Feb 23 18:38:28 <nullstring>	last slot
Feb 23 18:38:36 <nullstring>	I might try re-arranging to see what happens
Feb 23 18:39:19 <MacGyver>	Looks like at the very least all three x16 slots on that board are gen2.
Feb 23 18:39:38 <nullstring>	right exactly...
Feb 23 18:40:20 <MacGyver>	What CPU is in there?
Feb 23 18:41:15 <nullstring>	2500k
Feb 23 18:41:22 <nullstring>	https://nopaste.net/AeKam20aHS
Feb 23 18:41:46 <nullstring>	I have 2 ssds and 1 10gb network card. All three are being downgraded very low
Feb 23 18:42:08 <MacGyver>	There's very little details in the manual here.
Feb 23 18:42:14 <nullstring>	HMMM
Feb 23 18:42:22 <nullstring>	16 lanes of pcie gen 2 on the cpu
Feb 23 18:42:26 <nullstring>	am I running into that...
Feb 23 18:42:39 <MacGyver>	Possibly, yes.
Feb 23 18:42:48 <nullstring>	but it still should be faster than this
Feb 23 18:42:51 <nullstring>	well damn it
Feb 23 18:42:58 <MacGyver>	In which case it's likely doing something like 8x/4x/2x and reserve the last 2x for other stuff on the mainboard.
Feb 23 18:43:32 <MacGyver>	Does the conversion card show up *separately* in lspci?
Feb 23 18:43:38 <nullstring>	no
Feb 23 18:43:55 <nullstring>	MacGyver: the full lspci output is on that link up there if you're curious
Feb 23 18:45:07 <nullstring>	it's more like I am getting 2x/2x/1x based on the GT/s
Feb 23 18:45:21 <lhearachel>	I have 3 drives on my workstation: 1 NVMe with /, 1 SSD with /home, 1 HDD currently unused. How could I configure the FS to use that HDD for, say, storing large image and video files inside /home? Is that supported by btrfs?
Feb 23 18:45:58 <MacGyver>	nullstring: Is the 01:00.0 device on the *same* conversion card?
Feb 23 18:46:19 <nullstring>	MacGyver: no, two cards
Feb 23 18:46:37 <nullstring>	one conversion card in the first slot, 10gb in second slot, another conversion card in third slot
Feb 23 18:48:13 <MacGyver>	nullstring: Same conversion card?
Feb 23 18:48:23 <nullstring>	oh, same model? yes
Feb 23 18:48:36 <MacGyver>	oh, yeah, this time around I did mean same model.
Feb 23 18:48:44 <MacGyver>	The first time I *did* actually mean same physical card :P
Feb 23 18:48:46 <MacGyver>	Sorry.
Feb 23 18:48:48 <nullstring>	lol
Feb 23 18:49:39 <MacGyver>	I wonder whether the difference in Exit Latency is the cause of the differently negotiated link speeds.
Feb 23 18:50:46 <MacGyver>	You could try swapping the 3: card with the 2: network card.
Feb 23 18:51:20 <nullstring>	thats an 8x card though, perferably shouldn't get in a 4x slot
Feb 23 18:51:31 <nullstring>	but actually I uges.s..
Feb 23 18:51:36 <nullstring>	we're way past that aren't we 
Feb 23 18:51:37 <MacGyver>	Just for diagnosing.
Feb 23 18:51:44 <nullstring>	ok yeah at least see what happens
Feb 23 18:52:22 <MacGyver>	It's *possible* that only the first PCIe slot is hooked up to the CPU.
Feb 23 18:52:30 <MacGyver>	The other two are handled by the z68 chipset.
Feb 23 18:52:48 <MacGyver>	Which supports up to 8 lanes in x1 / x2 / x4 configurations.
Feb 23 18:52:58 <MacGyver>	Oh, so!
Feb 23 18:53:11 <MacGyver>	Probably the first *two* slots are hooked up to the CPU.
Feb 23 18:53:18 <MacGyver>	And the third is running through the chipset.
Feb 23 18:54:27 <nullstring>	yes thats what I think as well, but then why are those also slow?
Feb 23 18:54:45 <nullstring>	I am going to try with just one m2 in the first slot, then add the second one, just collect some data
Feb 23 18:55:15 <MacGyver>	nullstring: Well, they're fast*er*.
Feb 23 18:55:34 <MacGyver>	nullstring: The 1: device is getting x4 at 5GT/s, the maximum of PCIe gen2.
Feb 23 18:59:20 <nullstring>	MacGyver: that can't be right?
Feb 23 18:59:35 <MacGyver>	Why can't it be right?
Feb 23 18:59:38 <nullstring>	gen 2 is supposed to be 5GT/s per lane
Feb 23 18:59:48 <nullstring>	gen 1 is 2.5GT/s per lane
Feb 23 18:59:57 <nullstring>	am I misunderstanding something
Feb 23 18:59:57 <MacGyver>	No, 5GT/s is how fast the link operates regardless of how many lanes.
Feb 23 19:00:25 <MacGyver>	And at 5GT/s you'll get at most 500MB/s out of a single gen2 lane.
Feb 23 19:00:42 <MacGyver>	(And 2GB/s if it can actually use all 4 lanes at full speed)
Feb 23 19:00:47 <nullstring>	ah so you're saying the fact that it says 5GT/s is a per lane rating
Feb 23 19:00:59 <nullstring>	so it's really 20GT/s?
Feb 23 19:01:03 <nullstring>	5GT x 4?
Feb 23 19:01:03 <MacGyver>	No.
Feb 23 19:01:12 <nullstring>	o.O
Feb 23 19:01:18 <MacGyver>	It's the link speed negotiated for that slot, it's 5GT/s. It's using 4 lanes *at* 5GT/s.
Feb 23 19:01:34 <nullstring>	but one lane iss upposed to be 5GT/s
Feb 23 19:01:46 <MacGyver>	Giga-transfers per second is irrespective of lanes.
Feb 23 19:01:58 <MacGyver>	PCIe gen2 runs at 5GT/s.
Feb 23 19:02:12 <MacGyver>	The bandwidth of a single lane *at that speed* is 500MB/s.
Feb 23 19:02:25 <nullstring>	5gb not 500MB..
Feb 23 19:02:32 <MacGyver>	No, 500MB/s.
Feb 23 19:02:35 <nullstring>	???
Feb 23 19:02:42 <nullstring>	can you show me some documentation?
Feb 23 19:02:45 <MacGyver>	It can perform 5 giga *transfers*.
Feb 23 19:02:52 <nullstring>	ok
Feb 23 19:03:03 <MacGyver>	And the *bandwidth* of *one* link doing 5 giga transfers is 500 megabytes.
Feb 23 19:03:08 <nullstring>	ok
Feb 23 19:03:18 <nullstring>	that sounds right
Feb 23 19:03:30 <MacGyver>	Uh.
Feb 23 19:03:37 <nullstring>	so actually maybe what happening is.. that last slot is getting gen1 instead of gen 2
Feb 23 19:03:39 <MacGyver>	Of one *lane* doing 5 giga transfers.
Feb 23 19:03:49 <nullstring>	cause thats what seems to be going on here..
Feb 23 19:03:51 <MacGyver>	Yeah the final slot is operating at gen1 *speeds*.
Feb 23 19:03:57 <MacGyver>	Even though it's supposed to be a gen2 slot.
Feb 23 19:04:14 <MacGyver>	And I can't really tell you why from the output or documentation.
Feb 23 19:04:48 <MacGyver>	The chipset sure as hell should be running it at gen2 speeds.
Feb 23 19:06:01 <nullstring>	HMMM so whats the solution. HMMMM
Feb 23 19:06:32 <MacGyver>	Well, honestly, don't put a flag on a mud barge.
Feb 23 19:07:12 <MacGyver>	The combined bandwidth of the devices you're trying to run vastly outstrips the theoretical maximum this mainboard/chipset/CPU combo will ever be able to provide.
Feb 23 19:07:57 <MacGyver>	I wouldn't be surprised if you're also being limited by other bottlenecks in copying data from the network to the disk, or between disk and memory, for example.
Feb 23 19:08:14 <sangy>	what's the wayland equivalent of xev 
Feb 23 19:08:24 <MacGyver>	sangy: Knowing wayland, yev?
Feb 23 19:10:21 <nullstring>	MacGyver: perhaps
Feb 23 19:10:54 <teraflops>	MacGyver: wev
Feb 23 19:10:57 <nullstring>	that second ssd is supposed to be a second ssd for a bcachefs array
Feb 23 19:11:01 <nullstring>	maybe I'll just go without it
Feb 23 19:12:04 <teraflops>	sangy: wev
Feb 23 19:18:26 <nullstring>	MacGyver: so the two drives are in a md array. won't boot without the drives in their correct slots (apparently.)
Feb 23 19:18:46 <nullstring>	not that I think that it'll tell us much by moving them around
Feb 23 19:18:59 <nullstring>	but thats kinda annoying. will have to look into that
Feb 23 19:26:08 <nullstring>	I wonder what the cheapest computer I could buy to replace this would be...
Feb 23 19:31:16 <sangy>	!wtf wev
Feb 23 19:31:18 <phrik>	sangy: extra/wev
Feb 23 19:31:28 <sangy>	thanks!
Feb 23 19:32:46 <sangy>	huh, according to wev my keyboard *is* sending the volume up/down keycodes but my wm is not reacting to it. The weird bit is that my old keyboard would also send *some* keycode to raise/lower volume and it used to work
Feb 23 19:32:48 <sangy>	what gives?
Feb 23 19:33:47 <NetSysFire>	can you try with a minimal, unconfigured wm or something to ensure the keyboard is sending it at all? also check your journal, there may be unconfigured keycodes
Feb 23 19:33:53 *	NetSysFire is very unfamiliar with wayland
Feb 23 19:35:35 <nullstring>	MacGyver: anyways thanks for the help. Although we didn't really do anything other than figure out how to read the lspci output lol
Feb 23 19:35:48 <nullstring>	I wonder what version of the bios I am on or anything like that hMM
Feb 23 19:36:51 <NetSysFire>	sangy: because the wm may swallow the keycode and stuff
Feb 23 19:38:39 <ttnk>	hello, i've just installe arch on a laptop, years since i installed it, but im facing a very strange thing, when i do a shutdown or reboot it just got to a black screen and never shutdowns, i have win11 also installed and working on grub
Feb 23 19:38:47 <ttnk>	what could be the problem?
Feb 23 19:39:15 <sangy>	NetSysFire: but why didn't it swallow the keycode on the other keyboard?
Feb 23 19:39:29 <sangy>	like I exchange it and it owrks w/ the other, the keycode looks the same...
Feb 23 19:39:38 <NetSysFire>	i have no idea and honestly i may have missed reading that part
Feb 23 19:40:24 <sangy>	I guess I'll just spit out both of their wev logs until I figure it out 
Feb 23 19:40:29 <sangy>	weird stuff tho
Feb 23 19:40:52 <NetSysFire>	computers were a mistake. we should have never tricked sand into doing maths for us
Feb 23 19:40:53 <sangy>	ttnk: how are you turning it off
Feb 23 19:40:59 <sangy>	yeah computers fucking duper super suck
Feb 23 19:49:49 <ttnk>	sangy: as root  'shutdown -h now' or 'reboot'
Feb 23 19:50:19 <NetSysFire>	check the archwiki if theres a page or general info for your laptop
Feb 23 19:52:25 <sangy>	ttnk: can you check out the journal (journalctl) of the last boot (-b -1) around the end of it (-e)
Feb 23 19:52:32 <sangy>	see if there are any hints as to what that could be 
Feb 23 19:53:00 <NetSysFire>	its likely acpi shenanigans coming from the firmware
Feb 23 19:53:14 <ttnk>	watchdog: watchdog0: watchdog did not stop!
Feb 23 19:53:19 <Vorpal>	I'm trying to run perf as a normal user but I sometimes get "failed to mmap with 12 (Cannot allocate memory)". It isn't consistent. As root it works fine. I'm guessing there is some limit or other that is relevant. I just don't know which one
Feb 23 19:53:24 <sangy>	prolly yeah, but it's always good to start w/ "is the computer plugged in" type of stuff
Feb 23 19:53:47 <sangy>	ttnk: it could be not the last line. I get that wd warning on my ryzen cpus. Anything that seems super out of place?
Feb 23 19:54:05 <Vorpal>	since it isn't consistent (it is in fact rare I would say) it is difficult to debug
Feb 23 19:55:34 <sangy>	Vorpal: I think it's a stable bug, doesn't say "sometimes" or so anywhere on the desc
Feb 23 19:56:31 <Vorpal>	sangy: hm? Almost every time perf works fine. Maybe once out of 30 times it doesn't.
Feb 23 19:56:41 <Vorpal>	so I don't quite get what you mean
Feb 23 19:56:57 <sangy>	Vorpal: oh sorry I thought you were referring to ttnk's bug 
Feb 23 19:57:09 <baltazar>	hi! could pacstrap / pacman be broken on the latest archiso? pacstrap dies due to some kind of keyring error: http://0x0.st/H5tV.txt
Feb 23 19:57:17 <Vorpal>	sangy: no I'm referring to my own issue
Feb 23 19:57:40 <sangy>	baltazar: huh, that sounds more like you don't have enough memory or something
Feb 23 19:58:20 <sangy>	Vorpal: yeah my b
Feb 23 19:58:49 <baltazar>	sangy: well, i have 4 gib ram, should be more than enough (this is a vm btw)
Feb 23 19:59:14 <sangy>	did you assign 4gib ram to the vm?
Feb 23 19:59:31 <baltazar>	yeah, free reports 3.8Gi inside the vm
Feb 23 20:00:04 <sangy>	you're in the iso rn? what's your partition layout?
Feb 23 20:00:28 <sangy>	specifically, the partition that holds /etc/pacman.d 
Feb 23 20:01:10 <baltazar>	just a single root partition, ext4, 30G
Feb 23 20:02:43 <baltazar>	well this is strange
Feb 23 20:02:56 <baltazar>	I initialized the keyring in the iso and now pacstrap works fine...
Feb 23 20:08:39 <sangy>	huh that's weird
Feb 23 20:08:59 <sangy>	I don't think I see code changes in the iso/pacstrap that touched that init bit 
Feb 23 20:15:51 <f1refly>	when pasting dmesg dumps on the archlinux bbs, should I dump them in a pastebin or put them in [code] tags?
Feb 23 20:16:01 <f1refly>	I searched around and didn't find anything :/
Feb 23 20:17:30 <sangy>	f1refly: how large is it 
Feb 23 20:18:48 <nullstring>	any thoughts on the easiest way to flash this bios: https://www.asus.com/us/supportonly/p8z68-v/helpdesk_bios/
Feb 23 20:18:49 <phrik>	Title: P8Z68-V - Support (at www.asus.com)
Feb 23 20:19:48 <f1refly>	sangy: multiple stack traces per dmesg dump, very uncomfortable to read, about four dumps
Feb 23 20:20:39 <nullstring>	nvm figured it out.. maybe..
Feb 23 20:20:45 <sangy>	nullstring: not sure if fwupd works for tasus bios but 
Feb 23 20:20:59 <nullstring>	looks like flashrom should work
Feb 23 20:21:11 <sangy>	nullstring: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Flashing_BIOS_from_Linux#ASUS 
Feb 23 20:21:12 <phrik>	Title: Flashing BIOS from Linux - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Feb 23 20:21:23 <sangy>	f1refly: I think it'd be fine, I don't think there's a good guidance and you can always update it 
Feb 23 20:22:13 <nullstring>	oh thanks sangy 
Feb 23 20:22:19 <nullstring>	I did not think to look for an 'asus' section
Feb 23 20:22:28 <sangy>	np!
Feb 23 20:29:11 <gdamjan>	I wonder if this line can be removed https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/uwsgi/-/blob/main/PKGBUILD?ref_type=heads#L96 now that there's a solution in upstream https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/commit/88b3d309894a7c5fb4eb3234fd233e610471b89d
Feb 23 20:29:13 <phrik>	Title: PKGBUILD · main · Arch Linux / Packaging / Packages / uwsgi · GitLab (at gitlab.archlinux.org)
Feb 23 20:44:14 <sangy>	gdamjan: not sure, have you tried it?
Feb 23 20:45:41 <gdamjan>	it works for php 8 without that hack
Feb 23 20:46:04 <gdamjan>	and, Arch doesn't have 7 no longer right?
Feb 23 20:55:05 <hackfoo>	gdamjan: hope not. php7 has been eol since 2022.
Feb 23 20:56:40 <cousin_luigi>	Greetings.
Feb 23 21:00:26 <cousin_luigi>	What's the arch packaging policy with regard to in-tree libraries? Should they be patched out if the system provides them?
Feb 23 21:13:41 <nullstring>	oh this is strange. I updated this bios and now I can't boot to EFI MacGyver. Bios doesn't see it or something
Feb 23 21:13:49 <nullstring>	lets see if it can see it on a usb drive...
Feb 23 21:14:25 <Foxboron>	cousin_luigi: *generally* we prefer to devendor when we can in the repositories. But depending on the work it's sometimes not realistic and thus stuff is vendored
Feb 23 21:17:06 <nullstring>	it can... how odd..

Feb 23 21:32:19 <apm>	(gnome-tweaks:55396): Gtk-WARNING **: 21:30:49.644: Could not load a pixbuf from /org/gtk/libgtk/icons/16x16/status/document-open-symbolic.symbolic.png.
Feb 23 21:32:19 <apm>	This may indicate that pixbuf loaders or the mime database could not be found.
Feb 23 21:32:19 <apm>	**
Feb 23 21:33:46 <apm>	I'm at a loss on how to try fixing this... I found a post on the BBS suggesting I run `update-mime-database /usr/share/mime` and `gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders --update-cache`, but this has not brought back my GTK sadly.

Feb 23 21:41:28 <cousin_luigi>	By the way, does anyone here know kamailio or the SIP protocol in general?
Feb 23 21:41:50 <cousin_luigi>	I'm desperate about getting even only a scrap of extra info.
Feb 23 22:44:44 <apm>	I tried clearing my .config/gtk* (moved to backup folder) but sadly no luck.
Feb 23 22:50:20 <apm>	I suspect it may be an issue with XDG_DATA_DIRS. It is set to the following: /home/apm/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share /var/lib/flatpak/exports/share /usr/local/share /usr/share
Feb 23 22:50:30 <susi>	apm: you could try mv'ing /usr/lib/gdk-pixbuf-*/*/loaders.cache file and generate a new one with gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders
Feb 23 22:51:02 <susi>	or just running it with --update-cache
Feb 23 22:51:55 <apm>	apm@apg ~> cd /usr/lib/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/
Feb 23 22:51:56 <apm>	apm@apg /u/l/g/2.10.0> sudo mv loaders.cache loaders.cache.borked
Feb 23 22:51:56 <apm>	[sudo] password for apm: 
Feb 23 22:51:56 <apm>	apm@apg /u/l/g/2.10.0> sudo gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders --update-cache
Feb 23 22:52:09 <apm>	Did this, sadly same crash is happening.
Feb 23 22:54:43 <susi>	how are permissions of /usr/share/mime
Feb 23 22:55:23 <apm>	drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 408 Feb 23 22:32 /usr/share/mime/
Feb 23 22:56:08 <apm>	!0x0
Feb 23 22:56:08 <phrik>	curl -F file=@- https://0x0.st
Feb 23 22:56:19 <susi>	what may have you done that messed things up? as you said you totally messed up 
Feb 23 22:56:38 <apm>	These are all the dirs inside of there: https://0x0.st/H5w9.txt
Feb 23 22:57:19 <apm>	I'm not sure when the issue exactly happened, but recently:
Feb 23 22:57:22 <apm>	- I deleted a Win11 icon theme that I had installed manually.
Feb 23 22:57:32 <apm>	- I ran paru -Syu to update all packaged
Feb 23 22:57:43 <susi>	 apm: you have many of those with just -rw------ when they should be -rw-r--r--
Feb 23 22:58:04 <apm>	That sounds important!
Feb 23 22:58:36 <apm>	Is there a way to fix this automatically, or would it be safest to manually switch them all to the correct perms?
Feb 23 23:00:33 <apm>	Found this: https://code.whatever.social/exchange/unix/questions/505063/how-to-repair-broken-permissions-on-files-in-usr-share-mime
Feb 23 23:00:36 <phrik>	Title: How to repair broken permissions on files in /usr/share/mime? | AnonymousOverflow (at code.whatever.social)
Feb 23 23:01:12 <susi>	you can do find with -perm and then -exec chmod for files found
Feb 23 23:01:31 <apm>	So 600 to 644?
Feb 23 23:01:37 <susi>	yeah
Feb 23 23:02:24 <apm>	https://0x0.st/H5wO.txt
Feb 23 23:02:43 <apm>	Hey, GTK programs launch now! That's great progress.
Feb 23 23:03:03 <apm>	Most icons are missing but I'm no longer crashing.
Feb 23 23:03:35 <apm>	Still getting this:
Feb 23 23:03:36 <apm>	(gnome-tweaks:248456): Gtk-WARNING **: 23:03:24.384: Could not load a pixbuf from icon theme.
Feb 23 23:03:36 <apm>	This may indicate that pixbuf loaders or the mime database could not be found.
Feb 23 23:08:58 <apm>	In nwg-look, this is what I see in icon themes: https://upload.allpurposem.at/9B9ky57TtjKN

Feb 23 23:09:13 <apm>	Clicking on Adwaita only changes the third folder and trash can. Everything else stays the same.
Feb 23 23:14:15 <susi>	why were your /usr/share/mime permissions f'ked up in the first place?
Feb 23 23:14:28 <susi>	it may indicate other permissions are too
Feb 23 23:14:31 <apm>	No clue. I never touched that folder in the first place.
Feb 23 23:15:09 <teraflops>	susi: that is the right question
Feb 23 23:15:22 <teraflops>	apm: maybe the software you are using?
Feb 23 23:15:55 <apm>	Yeah I agree... wish I knew why it changed though.
Feb 23 23:16:14 <apm>	I recently (this week) installed SideFX Houdini, not without many many permissions problems.
Feb 23 23:16:37 <apm>	However any commands I ran to fix permissions of the files its installer dropped, were on the specific files (no wildcards or recursive flags)
Feb 23 23:17:56 <susi>	is that breeze stuff from aur or repos?
Feb 23 23:18:24 <apm>	paru -Qq | grep breeze returns just three packages:
Feb 23 23:18:30 <apm>	breeze, breeze-gtk, breeze-icons
Feb 23 23:18:42 <apm>	breeze-gtk wasn't installed before, I installed it while trying to fix this issue.

Feb 23 23:19:48 <apm>	Is there a way to see what files pixbuf was failing to load? Maybe strace?

Feb 23 23:23:10 <apm>	hmmmm: -rw------- 1 root root 1275 Feb 23 22:51 loaders.cache
Feb 23 23:23:28 <apm>	That was it!! I set it to 755 and it works now!
Feb 23 23:30:13 <susi>	yet you did gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders --update-cache... I wonder why would it make it 0600
Feb 23 23:32:25 <susi>	you may set it to 644 too
Feb 23 23:32:48 <apm>	Okay! Thanks for your help :)
Feb 23 23:38:49 <susi>	apm: what's your umask
Feb 23 23:44:35 <apm>	umask (in a normal shell) returns 0077
Feb 23 23:44:49 <susi>	yeah, that's why you got these issues, and will have them in the future
Feb 23 23:45:27 <apm>	huh!
Feb 23 23:45:35 <apm>	How could this happen?
Feb 23 23:46:18 <susi>	is it set to that in /etc/login.defs
Feb 23 23:47:15 <susi>	at least set it to 027 and not 077
Feb 23 23:47:33 <susi>	I think 022 might be the default on Arch
Feb 23 23:47:34 <apm>	I see, I have UMASK 077 there. I don't remember setting that.
Feb 23 23:49:08 <apm>	I changed it to 027. Hope this won't happen again then :)
Feb 23 23:49:33 <apm>	I will be reinstalling Arch when I switch laptops in a couple months, will be extra careful to note down anything weird I do then.
Feb 23 23:58:19 <susi>	even 027 may cause issues, and one must understand it. good example is that --update-cache, with umask 027 and you sudoing the command, it'll produce loaders.cache that's not readable by 'others' - and those others, non-root users, need to read it
Feb 23 23:58:39 <susi>	022 is 'safe' in that regard
Feb 24 01:23:44 <Steven_M>	Hi, I'm trying out archinstall in a VM. There seems to be no way to confirm my profile choice and get back to the main menu. Enter toggles the checkbox and esc resets my choice.

Feb 24 03:15:21 <nerdistmonk>	well this stinks, the wiimote isn't seen by the computer.
Feb 24 03:16:15 <nerdistmonk>	as far as I can tell, bluetooth is working right on my arch install, but for whatever reason they can't sync up

Feb 24 12:29:59 <Red_man>	random crash
Feb 24 12:30:13 <Red_man>	no kb no mouse
Feb 24 12:30:19 <Red_man>	nothing
Feb 24 12:30:28 <Red_man>	have to reboot
Feb 24 12:30:41 <Namarrgon>	does the num-lock LED flash when it happens?
Feb 24 12:31:21 <Red_man>	no
Feb 24 12:31:45 <Namarrgon>	how do you reboot?

Feb 24 12:32:33 <Red_man>	huh i'll look
Feb 24 12:33:01 <Carbon_Monoxide>	Invisible windows are being rendered properly once I log into X11 Gnome session. How do I troubleshoot the invisible application window problem?
Feb 24 12:33:18 <bluetail>	wdym
Feb 24 12:33:22 <bluetail>	you said they are proper
Feb 24 12:33:30 <bluetail>	if they are proper, how can they be a problem
Feb 24 12:34:29 <Red_man>	i think i found it kernal and cach errors many
Feb 24 12:34:48 <Red_man>	ill pastebin it
Feb 24 12:35:23 <Carbon_Monoxide>	bluetail: Sorry for the confusion! I asked a question earlier.
Feb 24 12:35:37 <Carbon_Monoxide>	I have some application windows suddenly gone invisible recently. I'm on GNOME/Wayland/discrete nvidia+AMD CPU+GPU. I'm on proprietary nvidia-lts & linux-lts. Sorry for asking the same problem again because I was working busy yesterday and wasn't attentive to helpers.
Feb 24 12:36:05 <bluetail>	well
Feb 24 12:36:15 <Carbon_Monoxide>	Those app windows are VS Code, Element, Qt5 Settings, Signal Desktop, GIMP, and a lot more.
Feb 24 12:36:37 <bluetail>	Wayland is known require emergency throttling when too many 'events' are happening at the same time to avoid a fatal crash
Feb 24 12:36:45 <Carbon_Monoxide>	I suspect that it's something wrong with nvidia and wayland.
Feb 24 12:36:55 <bluetail>	Firefox had to be stripped cause it caused Wayland to crash
Feb 24 12:37:14 <bluetail>	I am not sure whats happening but maybe the windows are not being rendered properly in Wayland to avoid such a crash
Feb 24 12:37:32 <Red_man>	yep
Feb 24 12:37:33 <bluetail>	But on the other hand... in wayland, my games just have a black screen on wine
Feb 24 12:37:40 <bluetail>	maybe it is xorg-xwayland issue?
Feb 24 12:37:51 <Red_man>	 how to remove a pack
Feb 24 12:37:58 <Red_man>	-R?
Feb 24 12:38:08 <bluetail>	pacman -R yes
Feb 24 12:38:19 <Red_man>	thanks
Feb 24 12:38:35 <Carbon_Monoxide>	I've almost nothing running. Only Alacritty and WeeChat. Those problematic application windows just do not show.
Feb 24 12:38:58 <Carbon_Monoxide>	I suspect something wrong with xorg-wayland as well.
Feb 24 12:39:13 <bluetail>	 tbh wayland and xorg don't fit together
Feb 24 12:39:22 <bluetail>	 wayland was never made with users in mind
Feb 24 12:39:25 <Red_man>	this is the 1st time ive this issue on a linuxbox
Feb 24 12:39:27 <bluetail>	it is security heaven
Feb 24 12:39:36 <bluetail>	adding xorg is like punching holes through it
Feb 24 12:39:39 <Carbon_Monoxide>	I read the war gist about Wayland yesterday because of this problem.
Feb 24 12:40:05 <Carbon_Monoxide>	What do you mean by "it is security heaven"?
Feb 24 12:40:19 <bluetail>	wayland doesn't allow for any input automation by design
Feb 24 12:40:35 <bluetail>	it has other things too that are anti user pro security
Feb 24 12:40:43 <Carbon_Monoxide>	Is it really that secure? Or comparatively superior than xorg? Than I agree. Xorg is just wrong on security.
Feb 24 12:41:12 <Red_man>	im sorry i hav not used arch in yrs what is wayland
Feb 24 12:41:35 <bluetail>	a 20 year old protocol
Feb 24 12:41:38 <Carbon_Monoxide>	!wayland

Feb 24 12:41:54 <Red_man>	say no more lol
Feb 24 12:42:37 <Red_man>	i started using linux 2005
Feb 24 12:42:45 <bluetail>	it came out 2008 I think
Feb 24 12:42:53 <Namarrgon>	don't let bluetail radicalize you
Feb 24 12:42:55 <Red_man>	arch in 2014
Feb 24 12:43:00 <Carbon_Monoxide>	Gnome's default window system protocol
Feb 24 12:43:35 <Red_man>	i dont use gnome just xfce4 ion
Feb 24 12:43:36 <Carbon_Monoxide>	I'm not sure why I would use the term "interface" instead of protocol. I know I'm wrong.
Feb 24 12:44:12 <bluetail>	in X11/X you needed a window manager + display manager
Feb 24 12:44:20 <bluetail>	in wayland, we only talk about protocol
Feb 24 12:44:22 <Red_man>	yep
Feb 24 12:44:29 <kidnextdoor>	hi epople, please help, conky is shuting down on startup

Feb 24 12:47:05 <bluetail>	lol snappy 
Feb 24 12:48:14 <Red_man>	so i got a q 
Feb 24 12:48:48 <Red_man>	does pacman have a way to list pkgs in a catagory
Feb 24 12:48:57 <Red_man>	such as web br
Feb 24 12:49:16 <Namarrgon>	packages are not sorted into categories, there's no such metadata
Feb 24 12:49:27 <Red_man>	oh ok
Feb 24 12:49:42 <Namarrgon>	arch does have package "groups" but those are usually organized by project
Feb 24 12:49:57 <Red_man>	oh intering
Feb 24 12:50:03 <bluetail>	sometimes .desktop files have categories
Feb 24 12:50:06 <Namarrgon>	"pacman -Sg"
Feb 24 12:50:20 <Carbon_Monoxide>	Crap. I'm considering KDE instead of GNOME.
Feb 24 12:50:34 <kystncode>	Hi I just installed arch with bspwm as my wm of choice. I have trouble with my laptop keyboard and at present do not wish to physically disconnect it. As a software work around to disabling it I googled and found that i can add the xinput float <id> command in bspwmrc. The issue is that the command doesn't work until after the ly login screen. How can i set it so that the keyboard is disabled before the login screen?
Feb 24 12:51:05 <bluetail>	I'd guess xprofile
Feb 24 12:51:20 <bluetail>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xprofile
Feb 24 12:51:21 <phrik>	Title: xprofile - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Feb 24 12:52:15 <Namarrgon>	ly doesn't use X
Feb 24 12:54:10 <kystncode>	xprofile appears to be compatible with GDM LightDM LXDM SDDM
Feb 24 12:54:45 <bluetail>	"bspwm is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree. It only responds to X events, and the messages it receives on a dedicated socket."
Feb 24 12:54:56 <bluetail>	ly doesn't use X?
Feb 24 12:55:00 <Tom^>	kystncode: you want it completly disabled like forever?

Feb 24 12:56:57 <kidnextdoor>	seriously, conky closes right after i move the mouse, so strange, anyone help me please!!!
Feb 24 12:57:18 <archdemon>	kidnextdoor: he showed you the link to the bug report or whatever it was
Feb 24 12:57:21 <Namarrgon>	kystncode: so you wnat to disable it completely and it's not really tied to ly or bspwm?
Feb 24 12:58:02 <kystncode>	Namarrgon: yes that would work too
Feb 24 12:58:17 <kidnextdoor>	archdemon, yes i understand someone already reported a bug, but sometimes people solve it faster than develoeprs
Feb 24 12:58:19 <Namarrgon>	kystncode: is the internal keyboard connected via usb?
Feb 24 12:58:59 <kystncode>	Namarrgon: i don't think so. Iirc a ribbon connector

Feb 24 13:03:03 <bluetail>	kidnextdoor downgrade conky
Feb 24 13:03:05 <kidnextdoor>	hmm im starting to think the problem is not with conky
Feb 24 13:03:25 <Namarrgon>	did you look at the bugreport?
Feb 24 13:03:32 <kidnextdoor>	i removed my config file from conky to revert back to default conf file and still got same error
Feb 24 13:03:49 <bluetail>	would it make sense to use conky appimage from 2020? https://www.appimagehub.com/p/1351503/
Feb 24 13:03:50 <kidnextdoor>	this error is very similar to the error i get running belnder that still isnt working for me

Feb 24 13:08:21 <kidnextdoor>	sorry, im just trying to figure out what can i do
Feb 24 13:08:40 <Namarrgon>	help debug conky or downgrade and wait for a fix
Feb 24 13:09:08 <kidnextdoor>	and blender?
Feb 24 13:09:19 <Namarrgon>	one thing at a time
Feb 24 13:10:00 <kidnextdoor>	if i donwload blender from their website it runs fine, but it defeats the whole purpose of having repos to update everything easily at same time
Feb 24 13:10:45 <bluetail>	be good to yourself
Feb 24 13:10:53 <bluetail>	run whatever works for you
Feb 24 13:10:56 <bluetail>	no need for perfection
Feb 24 13:13:42 <kidnextdoor>	sorry but i need everything at least running, is not perfection to ask for stuff to at least run without crashing

Feb 24 13:14:17 <kidnextdoor>	im building an entire company and all company will run on arch linux, can you understand?
Feb 24 13:15:37 <Namarrgon>	kidnextdoor: you have a serially connected keyboard, it's using the i8042 kernel module. you can selectively disable it with a (kernel-)parameter
Feb 24 13:15:40 <Namarrgon>	kystncode: ^
Feb 24 13:15:55 <Carbon_Monoxide>	Someone has reported the same issue 21 hours ago. I had this issue in about 2 days ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/wayland/comments/1ay2fwi/opened_windows_arent_visible_text_disappearing/

Feb 24 13:16:42 <kidnextdoor>	Namarrgon, hmm wait, yes i bought a new keyboard yesterday
Feb 24 13:16:49 <Namarrgon>	kidnextdoor: that wasn't for you
Feb 24 13:16:59 <kidnextdoor>	ah ok
Feb 24 13:17:15 <bluetail>	kidnextdoor imo if you want reproducability in a large company you'd rather be on nixos
Feb 24 13:17:41 <kystncode>	Namarrgon: serially connected as in via usb? I have a dell keyboard that i have connected and use via usb. 
Feb 24 13:17:43 <bluetail>	archlinux is more like bleeding-edge, experimental in the sense of being not mission critical, as far as I understood
Feb 24 13:17:50 <Namarrgon>	kystncode: no, not usb
Feb 24 13:18:52 <kidnextdoor>	bluetail, yes i know arch is "unstable" rolling release, but im smart cause i use linux-lts
Feb 24 13:19:27 <bluetail>	kidnextdoor no, the packages
Feb 24 13:19:39 <bluetail>	and the store location of the settings and all that stuff
Feb 24 13:19:56 <kidnextdoor>	do you work for nix bluetail?
Feb 24 13:20:06 <bluetail>	now you are being disrespectful
Feb 24 13:20:14 <bluetail>	ofc not
Feb 24 13:20:19 <bluetail>	I use nixos as my recovery option
Feb 24 13:20:34 <bluetail>	the only thing that really is worse in nixos is the time commitment you need
Feb 24 13:23:24 <kidnextdoor>	thats why i like arch, you just install it and everything runs
Feb 24 13:23:40 <kidnextdoor>	except conky and blender of corse
Feb 24 13:24:41 <kidnextdoor>	brb
Feb 24 13:24:41 <Metroid>	surprised people still use conky
Feb 24 13:24:45 <bluetail>	thats literally not how it is kidKych7
Feb 24 13:24:48 <bluetail>	oh
Feb 24 13:24:50 <bluetail>	they left
Feb 24 13:24:54 <Metroid>	it was a thing like 10 years
Feb 24 13:25:07 <bluetail>	Metroid conky is abandonware by now
Feb 24 13:25:10 <NetSysFire>	Metroid: is there an alternative to conky though?
Feb 24 13:25:38 <Metroid>	yes it's realising you dont need to look at resource usage every second ;P
Feb 24 13:25:53 <katia>	that sounds like a great alternative!
Feb 24 13:26:16 <Metroid>	like i3 / hyrland etc users who have hdd space on their bar, why ?
Feb 24 13:26:27 <Metroid>	why do you need to know that all the time ?
Feb 24 13:26:38 <teraflops>	…
Feb 24 13:26:51 <bluetail>	Metroid cognitive reasons
Feb 24 13:26:56 <bluetail>	the same you want to know the time
Feb 24 13:26:58 <bluetail>	all the time
Feb 24 13:27:10 <bluetail>	you don't want first to  visit a website that tells you
Feb 24 13:27:14 <Metroid>	time is different
Feb 24 13:27:17 <bluetail>	nope
Feb 24 13:27:20 <teraflops>	the fact that there is a thing there doesn't mean you have to look at it all the time
Feb 24 13:27:37 <teraflops>	you just take a look when you need it
Feb 24 13:27:50 <Metroid>	the fact its there makes me question the user
Feb 24 13:28:10 <bluetail>	if you wanna know space used for hdd you gotta remember a hella lot if you don't use a ui
Feb 24 13:28:18 <kidnextdoor>	Metroid, you dont have any system monitor?
Feb 24 13:28:19 <bluetail>	df -BG for the most simple...
Feb 24 13:30:30 <Metroid>	df -h looks to be the same as that
Feb 24 13:44:44 <kidnextdoor>	i cant trust packages from repos is taht it? i should build my own packages?
Feb 24 13:45:31 <Red_man>	i think i found the problen llmnr
Feb 24 13:46:37 <Allos>	Hi, how can I merge monitors into a single display for games?
Feb 24 13:46:44 <Allos>	single virtual display
Feb 24 13:47:11 <Allos>	On Gnome/Wayland and gamescope didn't work.
Feb 24 13:47:21 <edu4rdshl>	kidnextdoor, that's nonsense tbh but feel free to do whatever you want
Feb 24 13:47:48 <edu4rdshl>	Allos, what have you tried
Feb 24 13:47:57 <Red_man>	so llmnr do i need it
Feb 24 13:48:00 <novns>	Allos, if you use nvidia run their configuration tool, you can arrange displays there
Feb 24 13:48:08 <Allos>	AMD
Feb 24 13:48:10 <kidnextdoor>	are arch linux donations transparent like some other distros that use opencollective plattform?
Feb 24 13:48:12 <novns>	AMD chould have something similar
Feb 24 13:48:18 <novns>	*should
Feb 24 13:48:19 <edu4rdshl>	kidnextdoor, look in the website
Feb 24 13:48:28 <edu4rdshl>	Red_man, depends
Feb 24 13:48:37 <Red_man>	ok
Feb 24 13:48:44 <Red_man>	on what
Feb 24 13:49:08 <kidnextdoor>	is there a way to see where the money is being spent?
Feb 24 13:49:51 <edu4rdshl>	Red_man, if you see what's llmnr you'll understand
Feb 24 13:50:11 <Red_man>	i looked it up its no good
Feb 24 13:50:26 <edu4rdshl>	> The Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution is a protocol based on the Domain Name System packet format that allows both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local link.
Feb 24 13:50:40 <edu4rdshl>	So, depends if you need that
Feb 24 13:50:43 <Red_man>	yeah read that
Feb 24 13:50:44 <Namarrgon>	have you found the end of the log?
Feb 24 13:50:53 <Namarrgon>	it's very unlikely that llmnr is causing the freeze
Feb 24 13:50:58 <kidnextdoor>	arch linux needs transparent finances, public to all to see. like endeavourOS. i bet thats why some packages maintainers suck.
Feb 24 13:51:21 <Namarrgon>	kidnextdoor: you're starting to piss me off, so either go back to support questions or get out
Feb 24 13:51:22 <edu4rdshl>	Oh a patetic troll attempt
Feb 24 13:51:28 <Red_man>	ok keep looking for cause
Feb 24 13:51:59 <kidnextdoor>	i mean, it wouldnt hurt, or would it? if it would hurt, theres corruption. period.
Feb 24 13:52:03 <Red_man>	thanks
Feb 24 13:52:59 <Namarrgon>	kidnextdoor: don't throw baseless accusation around
Feb 24 13:53:32 <kystncode>	Namarrgon: so do i just insert i8042.nokbd in the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3 quiet" inside /etc/default/grub?
Feb 24 13:53:46 <Namarrgon>	kystncode: yup, that works
Feb 24 13:54:16 <Namarrgon>	don't forget to rebuild grub.cfg and to check /proc/cmdline after the reboot
Feb 24 13:56:08 <kystncode>	Namarrgon: so i just run grub mkconfig or update-grub after editing?
Feb 24 13:56:24 <Namarrgon>	the same way you did it during installation
Feb 24 13:56:52 <kidnextdoor>	i just want whats best for all arch users, i dont think theres a proper concern with maintainers, is not the first time people conplain about arch repos, why not pay more for maintaners and hire better ones?
Feb 24 13:57:12 <Namarrgon>	kidnextdoor: because no maintainer gets paid, they are all volunteers
Feb 24 13:57:31 <Namarrgon>	money is used to pay for the infrastructure
Feb 24 13:57:38 <Namarrgon>	and travel expenses
Feb 24 13:57:41 <kystncode>	Namarrgon: i believe that would be grub mkconfig

Feb 24 13:59:21 <Metroid>	update-grub is a ubuntu script so to speak, near sure arch doesnt have nor need it, you just do grub-mkconfig instead (with the right parameters)
Feb 24 14:00:12 <kidnextdoor>	what are travel expenses ? what is taht? where does arch linux goes?
Feb 24 14:00:24 <Namarrgon>	conferences
Feb 24 14:00:48 *	edu4rdshl alias update-grub='grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg'
Feb 24 14:00:52 <Foxboron>	kidnextdoor: internal conferences and social stuff, like FOSDEM
Feb 24 14:01:11 <kidnextdoor>	okok, but still, maintaners are slaves. end slavery.
Feb 24 14:01:18 <Foxboron>	kidnextdoor: Ah ffs, fuck off
Feb 24 14:01:22 <NetSysFire>	dude they are *volunteers*
Feb 24 14:01:34 <NetSysFire>	and you most certainly arent supporting the linux cause by spouting such dumb shit
Feb 24 14:01:45 <Metroid>	please slap the door in their face
Feb 24 14:01:46 <kidnextdoor>	this maintainer exploration also ffs me.
Feb 24 14:02:02 <kidnextdoor>	because then packages crash after updates
Feb 24 14:02:10 <NetSysFire>	THEN HELP TESTING THEM GOD DAMMIT
Feb 24 14:02:10 <edu4rdshl>	lmao
Feb 24 14:02:24 <Foxboron>	kidnextdoor: Talking with kids like you is what makes me loose motivation
Feb 24 14:02:24 <edu4rdshl>	As I said, a patetic troll attempt
Feb 24 14:02:24 <Namarrgon>	for someone who knows so little you have very strong opinions

Feb 24 14:03:08 <NetSysFire>	Metroid: well, what if they are testing and developing a LOT on them? :p
Feb 24 14:03:39 <NetSysFire>	i heard certain devs even have their own private island and sip a martini on the beach while packaging
Feb 24 14:03:46 <Red_man>	computers wernt even athing when i was 14 
Feb 24 14:03:55 <Red_man>	1974 lol
Feb 24 14:03:57 <NetSysFire>	be glad. computers were a mistake as you can see
Feb 24 14:04:00 <NetSysFire>	also feel old yet?
Feb 24 14:04:10 <Red_man>	i am old 
Feb 24 14:04:13 <Red_man>	64
Feb 24 14:04:25 <NetSysFire>	nice age, but i dont think you'll reach 128

Feb 24 14:04:36 <Red_man>	nope lol

Feb 24 14:09:21 <NetSysFire>	internet archives?
Feb 24 14:09:23 <edu4rdshl>	All of them suck on its own way

Feb 24 15:49:35 <powftw>	its definitely HW issue, but what exactly? Memory, disk?
Feb 24 15:50:08 <Namarrgon>	could be the cable connecting the display, they like to wear out
Feb 24 15:50:49 <powftw>	No, i could see the caps lock is keep on blinking and the whole system frozen up
Feb 24 15:50:56 <powftw>	See this image i posted earlier https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/AiOJtmTQ/10008205.jpg
Feb 24 15:51:07 <NetSysFire>	caps lock blinking means kernel panic
Feb 24 15:51:48 <powftw>	Yes, but why it happens when laptop is shaken as i've asked in the community. Many people i know with Dell has same issue
Feb 24 15:51:54 <powftw>	Windows and Linux 
Feb 24 15:52:19 <Namarrgon>	have you tested the individual ram dimms and slots?
Feb 24 15:52:51 <powftw>	By unscrewing?
Feb 24 15:53:01 <Namarrgon>	you'd have to open the case, yes
Feb 24 15:53:14 <powftw>	Nope
Feb 24 15:53:20 <NetSysFire>	no way around it
Feb 24 15:53:29 <powftw>	You suspect its either disk or memory?
Feb 24 15:53:31 <NetSysFire>	the only other idea i'd have is that some laptops, mostly hp ones, have a fall detection which spins down hdds so they dont get too damaged during a fall. that could act up due to a hardware issue, too maybe but your laptop may not even have that
Feb 24 15:54:07 <powftw>	Mine is kinda new laptop
Feb 24 15:54:18 <powftw>	Not new, but refurbished
Feb 24 15:54:33 <powftw>	Dell Latitude 7490
Feb 24 15:54:54 <panku>	powftw: if you google it you can see many others had the same issue
Feb 24 15:55:03 <powftw>	Yes, many have
Feb 24 15:55:15 <powftw>	I hate Dell for this very reason that i know
Feb 24 15:55:17 <panku>	HW related, either loose screws, cable connections, etc...
Feb 24 15:55:40 <powftw>	Will check with service centre
Feb 24 15:56:05 <powftw>	Not mem or disk related?
Feb 24 15:56:27 <powftw>	i believe its disk. 
Feb 24 15:56:44 <powftw>	Few days back, i had to clean disk after boot with fsck
Feb 24 15:56:49 <panku>	they also say how they fixed it
Feb 24 15:56:54 <powftw>	Because partition was not clean
Feb 24 15:57:24 <powftw>	Will check. Thanks!
Feb 24 15:57:38 <panku>	just open the thing and check all the cables/connections/screws :D
Feb 24 15:58:04 <powftw>	I have to ask another question. When i watch YT in Firefox, laptop heats up/uses more CPU. In chromium, its normal
Feb 24 15:58:25 <powftw>	panku: i dont have the tools
Feb 24 16:00:21 <powftw>	Hardware Acceleration is already enabled
Feb 24 16:00:40 <powftw>	i.e in firefox

Feb 24 17:28:35 <Earnestly>	(And the current kernel version can come from uname -r)
Feb 24 17:29:35 <panku>	Earnestly: that's why I'm using `version="$(ls /usr/lib/modules)"` . pacman -Q will work too, it's just a lazy way to have the kernel version in the grub menu  ^^
Feb 24 17:29:55 <Psi-Jack>	Hmmm. I have this annoying problem, and I have no clue how to fix it. I have two computers, Desktop and Tabtop (Laptop/Tablet 360-flip). Both computers moved with me from Florida to Canada, same Eastern timezone, but different physical location by far. Desktop 'current location' in gnome-clocks shows my old City/State. Vivaldi googling weather for
Feb 24 17:29:55 <Psi-Jack>	various cities/states around the world, Melbourne, Australia for example, shows Fahrenheit. Tabtop, on the other hand, shows Canada, Vivaldi shows Celsius appropriately as well. This has been an ongoing issue for over 2 years, and multiple system wipes as well. 
Feb 24 17:30:59 <Earnestly>	panku: I know, but that ls only really works on Arch by default, which I noted might be fine
Feb 24 17:32:05 <Earnestly>	Because ls doesn't properly nul terminate filenames it makes it difficult to use in scripts outside of a narrow set of assumptions, which is a pity. GNU ls recently added --zero which is nice though but doesn't work if globs expand directories
Feb 24 17:33:01 <panku>	yeah exactly, it is Arch focused assuming you are only using the bzImage from the arch repo
Feb 24 17:33:13 <susi>	panku: that grub-mkconfig also seems weird, and won't help much when something like this happens: https://archlinux.org/news/grub-bootloader-upgrade-and-configuration-incompatibilities/
Feb 24 17:33:14 <phrik>	Title: Arch Linux - News: Grub bootloader upgrade and configuration incompatibilities (at archlinux.org)
Feb 24 17:33:41 <susi>	as I stated earlier, no hook will run grub-install for you either
Feb 24 17:35:18 <panku>	I don't need to install grub after the a kernel update, right?
Feb 24 17:35:45 <Psi-Jack>	Does anyone have any idea why my desktop persistently continues to think my "current location" is my old city/state, when I'm not?
Feb 24 17:35:51 <heat_>	panku, right
Feb 24 17:36:25 <panku>	I just don't like seeing: 'Arch Linux with Linux linux' :D
Feb 24 17:36:49 <heat_>	linux linux linux linux linux
Feb 24 17:37:16 <panku>	Arch Linux with Linux linux using latest linux via linux inside Linux
Feb 24 17:37:24 <susi>	panku: did you check the news item I linked?
Feb 24 17:37:43 <susi>	your system would have become unbootable because of that grub-mkconfig there 
Feb 24 17:38:27 <panku>	because `grub-install` after grub upgrade
Feb 24 17:38:55 <heat_>	no it would not? you'd need to have grub-mkconfig'd without grub-installing
Feb 24 17:39:07 <heat_>	which is definitely pebkac
Feb 24 17:39:18 <susi>	which is happening here
Feb 24 17:39:30 <panku>	how is it happening?
Feb 24 17:39:38 <susi>	https://bpa.st/raw/WZU5G
Feb 24 17:40:44 <heat_>	oh, right, i didn't see that
Feb 24 17:40:46 <heat_>	my bad
Feb 24 17:41:54 <susi>	there's no guarantees, that the new config and the old image are compatible
Feb 24 17:44:53 <susi>	just set GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR (see /etc/grub.d/10_linux) to something if you don't like those Linux with Linux linux menu headers
Feb 24 17:46:25 <susi>	you may set it in /etc/default/grub
Feb 24 17:46:55 <Psi-Jack>	Is there any known issues with NetworkManager updates that recently went out, 1.46 from 1.44?
Feb 24 17:47:02 <panku>	from /etc/default/grub: GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="Arch"
Feb 24 17:47:47 <susi>	panku: is it uncommented?
Feb 24 17:47:54 <panku>	yeah
Feb 24 17:48:18 <panku>	I think it grabs the version from another place
Feb 24 17:48:35 <susi>	then it should generate headers like "Arch Linux, with Linux <kernel_name>"
Feb 24 17:49:01 <panku>	see version=`echo $basename | sed -e "s,vmlinuz-,,g"` from /etc/grub.d/10_linux
Feb 24 17:50:14 <panku>	I assume that's how the linux version that goes after "Arch Linux Linux ..." is grabbed
Feb 24 17:50:48 <susi>	see linux_entry() in 10_linux
Feb 24 17:50:58 <ecraven>	I'd like to use an external 18TB usb disk as a backup for my normal zfs raidz2.. how do I best do this? also use zfs and send it?
Feb 24 17:52:34 <panku>	susi: exactly, see how the variable 'version' inside 'linux_entry' function grabs the second argument?
Feb 24 17:52:53 <susi>	yeah, but this does not change the fact that doing grub-mkconfig like that probably ain't a good idea
Feb 24 17:54:31 <susi>	I'd rather write my own "10_linux", and I will now that we are talking bout this and I again saw how bloated the default one is
Feb 24 17:55:05 <panku>	I did changed "10_linux" as well :)
Feb 24 17:55:25 <susi>	it will be overwritten on upgrades, unless you add it to a NoExtract list
Feb 24 17:56:36 <panku>	the changes I made are just visual stuff, I guess I will check for grub updates before running the script :D
Feb 24 17:57:25 <panku>	another idea I had was to change the PKGBUILD file but hustle for just a grub entry wasn't worth it ...
Feb 24 17:58:11 <panku>	I understand why they just name the image 'vmlinuz-linux' instead of using version, it is just simple to work with during configuration
Feb 24 18:00:06 <Repentinus>	Because Arch doesn't support having multiple versions of the same kernel package installed.
Feb 24 18:01:30 <panku>	exactly
Feb 24 18:06:14 <heat_>	because you'd need to keep the "tag" name there anyway
Feb 24 18:06:22 <heat_>	i.e vmlinuz-6.1 vs vmlinuz-6.1-zen
Feb 24 18:06:34 <[-_-]>	guys, is CUDA only for Nvidia GPUs ?
Feb 24 18:06:53 <Repentinus>	Yes.
Feb 24 18:06:53 <heat_>	and in that case, you might do vmlinuz-6.1-linux vs vmlinuz-6.1-zen, and because the version number is now redundant you can also strip it
Feb 24 18:07:13 <Repentinus>	[-_-], OpenCL is not though.
Feb 24 18:07:26 <[-_-]>	okay
Feb 24 18:07:34 <[-_-]>	it seems vasp has a cuda version
Feb 24 18:08:12 <[-_-]>	and it failed to build because of lack of some include file, I was just thinking, since I don't have nvidia gpu, I don't need to build that version
Feb 24 18:08:34 <[-_-]>	just making sure I am doing the right thing
Feb 24 18:13:04 <damax>	Hello everyone, I'm having difficulties connecting to the best signal ap on my network: everytime I check the connection is slow, and indeed nmcli dev wifi list shows that it's connected to one of the worst signal aps available on the floor, while a much higher ap is available (signal ~75 instead of the connected ~45, according to nmcli, I'm not sure what that corresponds to for dBm). I'm clueless, I've 
Feb 24 18:13:09 <damax>	been trying to solve this problem on and off for months now, but it's starting to get quite annoying. I'm not sure what additional info I could share that would be useful. System is kernel 6.7.6-zen1-1-zen on a 21AKCTO1WW laptop, nm 1.46.0-1, network controller qualcomm QCNFA765 according to lspci.
Feb 24 18:19:01 <socksinspace>	the only thing that actually got deleted was, apparently, my efistub boot config, everything else seems fine, what are the chances
Feb 24 19:13:14 <susi>	panku: now I'm writing my own 11_linux :o already have a working version of it in 88 lines
Feb 24 19:14:09 <susi>	far from ready-to-use, but already produces correct entries from found items

Feb 25 03:34:26 <Psi-Jack>	Heh, funny, I was recently considering looking at actual nomachine stuff for remote desktop access to my systems versus AnyDesk, which... Is "free" but you cannot use the "address book" to save entries to. Which is pretty annoyingly stupid. And RustDesk which is concerning... 
Feb 25 03:34:56 <NetSysFire>	one remote desktop tool i took a liking to is parsec
Feb 25 03:35:35 <Psi-Jack>	Hmm.. Hadn't heard of that one.
Feb 25 03:35:56 <NetSysFire>	its even partly open and works natively on linux
Feb 25 03:36:10 <Psi-Jack>	And not made in China? :)
Feb 25 03:36:39 <NetSysFire>	not every chinese application has weird backdoors in them
Feb 25 03:36:54 <NetSysFire>	though i dont think parsec is chinese. i think its US devs or somewhere around the west
Feb 25 03:38:05 <Psi-Jack>	NetSysFire: While I know that, it's still always a red flag still, considering.
Feb 25 03:44:40 <Psi-Jack>	Hmmm.. 
Feb 25 03:45:02 <Psi-Jack>	So, not sure how to get it to show me my other computer in this thing, heh
Feb 25 03:49:08 <NetSysFire>	fairly sure you need to configure the server part for it there. it should be easy enough. i actually havent configured that part for myself since i just leech of someone elses machines
Feb 25 03:52:13 <Psi-Jack>	Hmmm, starting to kinda look like a common issue. Unable to serve their own computer.
Feb 25 05:04:12 <rcf>	I suspect nomachine is totally fine for not-nvidia, but you need a lot of tricks to get modern acceleration working over the network. 
Feb 25 05:04:32 <mefistofeles>	no machine is fine with nvidia
Feb 25 05:06:32 <rcf>	x2go and the other NX forks are the ones that have serious problems actually running anything modern. 
Feb 25 05:06:48 <rcf>	As they're stuck on an X server core from 2005. 
Feb 25 05:08:27 <CompanionCube>	what, they never updated it?
Feb 25 05:08:42 <rcf>	As far as I know, no. 
Feb 25 05:11:34 <wallabra>	I wish that the package go-yq PROVIDEs yq so that other potential implementations may supplant it instead of causing package dependency errors.
Feb 25 05:13:22 <rcf>	The problem is if it's not a complete implementation. 
Feb 25 05:13:50 <rcf>	Which it isn't. 
Feb 25 05:34:21 <wallabra>	rcf, what is a complete implementation of yq, then?
Feb 25 05:45:01 <edu4rdshl>	wallabra, whatever implements a 1:1 compatibility and featureset with yq
Feb 25 05:45:38 <edu4rdshl>	Also, what's the problem with yq?
Feb 25 05:47:19 <rcf>	wallabra: one that is sure not to inspire bug reports if someone installs it expecting compatibility 
Feb 25 05:47:48 <wallabra>	edu4rdshl/rcf, go-yq *is* the original implementation of yq, as far as I am aware
Feb 25 05:49:53 <rcf>	wallabra: if you can show that it does, actually, satisfy the dependencies, open an issue/MR 
Feb 25 05:52:01 <wallabra>	rcf: in this case it's usually makedepends as it is a tool that reads from YAML files using XQuery-like syntax, and I am using it in an AUR package. It just feels weird to put go-yq instead of just yq in my MAKEDEPENDS array, like it's not very future proof.
Feb 25 05:57:28 <rcf>	wallabra: try building the ten packages it's required by. 
Feb 25 05:58:04 <wallabra>	it what, go-yq?
Feb 25 05:58:56 <rcf>	Build a go-yq that provides yq. Build all the nextcloud crap. If it works, then do an MR. 
Feb 25 05:59:36 <rcf>	Also check for issues to see if someone else tried this 
Feb 25 06:02:52 <wallabra>	okay, thanks for the pointers

Feb 25 11:08:03 <astralc>	if I calculate correctly - 1421700 x 4kb  = 5.6868 gigabytes
Feb 25 11:08:14 <astralc>	you still don't have enough
Feb 25 11:09:53 <kusf>	astralc: Ah, I don't know if it's btrfs I'll try to find that out. I've never had this problem before so I'm out of my depth with this one. Will see what is going on from what you've said so far. Thank you.
Feb 25 11:10:46 <astralc>	It doesn't matter for btrfs (there can be issue with not enough metadata space some times), but I don't think this is the issue
Feb 25 11:11:36 <astralc>	20gb is very very small for /, unless you are doing very very minimal install
Feb 25 11:12:30 <kusf>	astralc: I wasn't even installing, I was just trying to update and instal a few files on the server.
Feb 25 11:12:50 <kusf>	There's only 20gb for the server itself.
Feb 25 11:13:16 <kusf>	I'm doing this for a friend who is very ill who used to maintain this server but they're unable to do it now.
Feb 25 11:13:52 <astralc>	you need download space + update space, not sure if it "file by file" change.
Feb 25 11:14:09 <astralc>	remove a uneeded big package and try again?
Feb 25 11:14:39 <kusf>	Yeah I removed 3 gigs of cached packages and I thought that should have worked for what I'm doing.
Feb 25 11:14:42 <Santzes>	maybe you could clean up the package directory, mount it from remote filesystem instead and then do the upgrade
Feb 25 11:14:54 <astralc>	or clean home
Feb 25 11:15:06 <kusf>	Santzes: Ah, that's an idea, thanks.
Feb 25 11:15:33 <kusf>	astralc: Yeah I'm not sure what I can remove from there that's all right at the moment as I can't ask about it right now.
Feb 25 11:15:57 <kusf>	Right will try another package cache clean down to the 1 and see how it goes.
Feb 25 11:28:48 <kusf>	astralc and Santzes Thanks a bunch for your help!

Feb 27 23:36:18 <edu4rdshl>	TigerPro, that's definitely a bad idea
Feb 27 23:36:43 <edu4rdshl>	"if only" - then proceed to enumerate the whole PKGBUILD
Feb 27 23:36:45 <edu4rdshl>	lol
Feb 27 23:40:45 <TigerPro>	just the numbers that increment and the hashes
Feb 27 23:41:21 <astralc>	but it still "different source location" you should check
Feb 27 23:42:06 <TigerPro>	usually the source location line doesnt change and is built from the version numbers?
Feb 27 23:42:50 <astralc>	it will always change somehow, maybe it use variable
Feb 27 23:43:18 <TigerPro>	it will be same in the diff if it uses a variable
Feb 27 23:44:41 <TigerPro>	im finding most of my pkgbuild reviews are just to see the version number go up and the hashes change, seems like wasted time
Feb 27 23:45:12 <TigerPro>	but def want to keep reviewing for other changes
Feb 28 00:40:24 <rcf>	TigerPro: it's the usual problem with any non-declarative format. The PKGBUILD doesn't really tell you those things at all at a glance, it provides a program that will eventually tell you. 
Feb 28 00:42:38 <fenugrec>	sometimes the src URL changes which makes me take a closer look - new host, or fork, either way I'm interested to know. So I always check the PKGBUILd diff when upgrading
Feb 28 00:43:24 <rcf>	TigerPro: which, incidentally, is why .SRCINFO exists, and failing to update it will fail to lead to a visible change in aurweb, if you package something yourself.

Feb 28 02:10:25 <xgpt>	is gromit around?
Feb 28 02:10:56 <Psi-Jack>	mefistofeles: yeah, well, when you're working with generating a user_configuration.json as part of a backup/restore solution, it helps to understand more. 
Feb 28 02:11:28 <Namarrgon>	xgpt: they are in the channel, should we send someone to their home to check up on them?
Feb 28 02:11:57 <xgpt>	rcf: who was going to send an angry email? I was going to send a friendly email! It's been like...4 years since it was last updated. If the maintainer wasn't a regular user a quick ping saying "Hey this package you're marked as a maintainer as has been updated!" and that's it...idk
Feb 28 02:12:06 <xgpt>	but I'm just having issues with the package
Feb 28 02:12:15 <xgpt>	no we don't have to go hunt them down Namarrgon :P
Feb 28 02:12:21 <xgpt>	I'm struggling to get znc running on arch
Feb 28 02:12:29 <Namarrgon>	too late, i already sent the black helicopter
Feb 28 02:13:27 <Psi-Jack>	I don't see issues with znc on arch linux...
Feb 28 02:15:49 <tkna>	Hi!

Feb 28 02:15:51 <phrik>	Title: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Feb 28 02:16:51 <sheep>	tkna: you don't need those options
Feb 28 02:16:51 <xgpt>	Psi-Jack: struggling to get it started with systemd
Feb 28 02:17:01 <xgpt>	it runs if I su into the znc user and start it manually
Feb 28 02:17:03 <Psi-Jack>	xgpt: Well that's literally the east part...
Feb 28 02:17:10 <Psi-Jack>	easy*
Feb 28 02:17:36 <xgpt>	Psi-Jack: I think there's an error with the systemd unit file though
Feb 28 02:17:39 <Namarrgon>	tkna: you shouldn't need to add efivarfs to fstab, it will get mounted automatically
Feb 28 02:18:15 <xgpt>	it's starting with     Process: 21897 ExecStart=/usr/bin/znc -f --datadir=/var/lib/znc (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
Feb 28 02:18:54 <xgpt>	but the makeconf generates the conf inside of /var/lib/znc/.znc/configs/znc.conf not /var/lib/znc/configs
Feb 28 02:19:15 <sheep>	what was the exact makeconf command you used?
Feb 28 02:20:13 <tkna>	sheep, Namarrgon: I see. So it is automatically in the recommended state. To make it even safer, you can simply make it read-only except when you intend to write to it.
Feb 28 02:20:54 <xgpt>	how do I submit a patch against this package? I just fixed the systemd unit file on my system
Feb 28 02:21:08 <Namarrgon>	tkna: yes, but you'd need to to escalate to root to be able to write to them, at which point you've already lost the game
Feb 28 02:21:56 <xgpt>	is arch linux wiki and arch linux SSO the same logins? I can't seem to login to the gitlab
Feb 28 02:22:13 <Namarrgon>	no, these are separate accounts
Feb 28 02:23:04 <tkna>	Namarrgon: Currently, it seems to be readable to non-root (0755), is that correct?
Feb 28 02:24:07 <Namarrgon>	yes
Feb 28 02:26:15 <xgpt>	accountsupport@archlinux.org << Does anyone have access to this? 
Feb 28 02:28:25 <tkna>	Namarrgon: Okay, so if a non-root user can read it but not write it, it's not a problem. Thanks kindly.
Feb 28 02:28:47 <kevr>	xgpt: yes, they would not post a fake email for users to contact
Feb 28 02:29:17 <kevr>	but you may need to be patient and wait for a response, it may not be immediate

Feb 29 03:43:42 <sealsrock12>	Hi, I'm trying to open downloaded plaintext files from firefox into neovim. A process is created, but no terminal window pops up. I am using xfce4-terminal version 1.1.2, Firefox Developer Edition version 124.0b4, and neovim version 0.9.5. Any ideas?
Feb 29 03:46:34 <Namarrgon>	neovim or neovim-qt?
Feb 29 03:47:08 <sealsrock12>	neovim
Feb 29 03:58:43 <Psi-Jack>	And how are you telling firefox, specifically, to use xfce4-terminal and specifically neovim within said terminal?
Feb 29 04:03:34 <espresso>	Here, I might look at the DE Mime Settings
Feb 29 04:04:15 <espresso>	and FF has its own handlers in Settings>Applications
Feb 29 04:43:54 <sealsrock12>	Psi-Jack I am just using the application shortcut installed with the neovim package
Feb 29 04:44:14 <sealsrock12>	when I click that from xfce, it automatically opens with the default terminal emulator, which is xfce4-terminal
Feb 29 04:44:51 <sealsrock12>	Firefox asks me whether I want to save a file or open it in an application, and I select Neovim as that application
Feb 29 04:49:34 <espresso>	sealsrock12: the DE File Associations (or opening the .desktop file yourself) should show the exact command used, and you could try that at a console

Feb 29 05:03:27 <mefistofeles>	B-|: ah yeah, that would be where the sdists are stored
Feb 29 05:03:40 <B-|>	thank
Feb 29 05:21:29 <sealsrock12>	espresso: the .desktop file is just nvim %F, which works from the command line
Feb 29 05:44:17 <espresso>	sealsrock12: then i might wonder if nvim can access them when FF stores them (wherever) temporarily..
Feb 29 05:45:02 <espresso>	or maybe FF fails to run nvim?
Feb 29 06:00:28 <espresso>	sealsrock12: maybe try dropping them on FF from local filesystem
Feb 29 06:06:38 <txtsd>	Y'all, why are the openjdk licenses custom instead of GPL-2.0?
Feb 29 06:08:50 <txtsd>	I see the addition information file about licenses on their github repo, but isn't there an SPDX friendly way to represent the additional info?
Feb 29 06:34:25 <rcf>	txtsd: that file is very explicity telling anyone without a lawyer not to even think about it, so no. 
Feb 29 06:34:58 <txtsd>	How about just 'LicenseRef-custom'? That's more SPDX aligned.
Feb 29 06:39:44 <rcf>	You could argue for that, but it was an unresolved question in the RFC. 
Feb 29 06:50:43 <rcf>	txtsd: actually the official list of exceptions might cover this, GPL-2.0-only WITH Classpath-exception-2.0 AND OpenJDK-assembly-exception-1.0 
Feb 29 06:51:36 <rcf>	Or at least come depressingly close to doing so. 
Feb 29 06:53:56 <txtsd>	rcf: That is very helpful. Could you link me the RFC, please?

Feb 29 07:40:50 <BertoX>	Hello
Feb 29 07:43:00 <BertoX>	I used aurutils to install proton. As this is a long process, I went away from my computer. When I came back, I got a timeout while waiting me to enter sudo password. Now if I try to install proton again, aurutils says "nothing to do". How can I finalize the process ?

Feb 29 09:55:44 <japhir>	in 2017 I installed arch on this laptop, and the partitioning wiki page at the time (I actually found the page the other day: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Partitioning&oldid=469958) recommended 15-20 GB for / if you wanted discrete partitions (I don't recall why, but I opted to separate /boot / [swap] and /home rather than just one / partition). Now I'm often running out of space.
Feb 29 09:55:46 <japhir>	Any suggestions on how to resolve this? It's a thinkpad T470s laptop. Buy new SSD? Repartition?
Feb 29 09:55:47 <phrik>	Title: Partitioning - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Feb 29 09:58:24 <japhir>	I used the partition table 2.3.3 on that wiki page with 512 MB /boot, 20G /, 1G swap and 455.4 G /home
Feb 29 10:01:32 <japhir>	I've also used pacsize to get rid of big unneeded packages. Zoom is a terrible offender @ 655 MB but I need it for work :(
Feb 29 10:02:23 <japhir>	oh sorry, pacsize is an alias for expac -H M '%m\t%n' | sort -h
Feb 29 10:16:17 <Blutkoete>	japhir: Did you clean the pacman cache?
Feb 29 10:16:38 <Blutkoete>	Main offender in the past on my Arch boxes :)
Feb 29 10:20:36 <japhir>	Blutkoete: yeah I've been running pacman -Scc often to make space :(
Feb 29 10:34:39 <rcf>	japhir: unfortunately resizing would be extremely difficult. 
Feb 29 10:36:20 <rcf>	japhir: if you were going for a new SSD anyway... now might be the time to do it... but otherwise I'd just back up everything, repartition and recreate filesystems, move everything back, adjust bootloader and fstab to match. 
Feb 29 10:55:29 <japhir>	thanks, if someone on #archlinux says something is extremely difficult I'll take that as an "impossible for average users" ;-)
Feb 29 10:56:04 <rcf>	I mean it's possible, I suppose, but you'd want to back everything up anyway. 
Feb 29 10:56:05 <japhir>	Cool, I'll try to figure out how hard it is to replace both SSD and add some memory on this laptop
Feb 29 10:56:15 <rcf>	Expanding to the right is easy for a filesystem. 
Feb 29 10:56:38 <rcf>	Moving it is another matter. 
Feb 29 10:56:59 <japhir>	I could get rid of the swap partition, extend / by 1 GB, create a swapfile on /home?
Feb 29 10:57:07 <japhir>	but yeah, 1GB won't make the difference ;-)
Feb 29 10:57:30 <rcf>	That would be simple, yes, depending on your root filesystem 
Feb 29 10:57:37 <japhir>	it's all ext4
Feb 29 10:59:32 <rcf>	That works well 
Feb 29 11:00:11 <onla>	I'm using youtube outside the youtube website or app and I would want to mark some videos as favorites or such. I don't know how I should keep such list. Any reccomendations?
Feb 29 11:01:34 <japhir>	ok thank rcf, for bouncing some ideas :)
Feb 29 11:01:42 <japhir>	*thanks
Feb 29 11:01:50 <rcf>	japhir: if you go that route, see resize2fs
Feb 29 11:05:44 <japhir>	since this is my work laptop I think I'll postpone this until some holiday/weekend activity where I have plenty of time to fix it if I mess up ;-)
Feb 29 11:08:15 <japhir>	also considering trying out NixOS if I'm going to have to mess around at that level... but I've been in love with Arch since I started using Linux back in 2015 or so ;-) any thoughts? I thought this video was very nice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfKlX3rA6E&pp=ygUTbm9ib2lsZXJwbGF0ZSBuaXhvcw%3D%3D

Feb 29 11:08:29 <japhir>	definitely wouldn't switch now with low storage though ;-)
Feb 29 11:42:29 <Foxboron>	japhir: It's the direct opposite of Arch. That's the extent of my thoughts on it.
Feb 29 11:48:29 <japhir>	can you elaborate?

Feb 29 11:54:50 <rcf>	If you install your distro based on memes, it's about equivalent nowadays. 
Feb 29 12:01:19 <Foxboron>	japhir: This isn't a channel for this.
Feb 29 12:02:19 <rcf>	!offtopic
Feb 29 12:02:20 <phrik>	Take it to #archlinux-offtopic
Feb 29 12:10:41 <japhir>	I did not install Arch based on memes, I installed it because I wanted to learn more about how linux works by building a system from scratch. But yeah that was offtopic. I've joined the other channel incase someone wants to comment there.
Feb 29 12:29:12 <kurtosis>	Heads Up for those that run KDE/Plasma5.  There is a significant package upgrade set available in the Arch repos now that will migrate you from Plasma5 (X11) here previously, to now wayland-based Plasma6.  After reboot, I was shocked to see the unwanted Virtual k/b 'pasted over' and occupying ~50% of my SDDM login screen
Feb 29 12:30:24 <Namarrgon>	gotta keep rolling
Feb 29 12:33:55 <gromit>	kurtosis: aren't the packages still in the testing repos? 
Feb 29 12:34:10 <Tom^>	kurtosis: the default "choice" just changed nothing stopping you from selecting X11 again
Feb 29 12:36:28 <kurtosis>	If you read the sddm archwiki, it discusses how to enable, but not how to disable, the Virtual k/b.  One approach, I know works is to change the recommended InputMethod=qtvirtualkeyboard to `InputMethod=`.  Also the sddm wiki could a bump from Install qt5-virtualkeyboard to Install qt6-virtualkeyboard 
Feb 29 12:37:15 <kurtosis>	Tom^:  thanks, but well aware
Feb 29 12:38:46 <kurtosis>	gromit:  certaintly some of the packages were, all testing repos enabled here
Feb 29 12:40:15 <thrice>	all of plasma6 is still in testing, it seems
Feb 29 12:40:57 <jelle>	it is
Feb 29 12:42:37 <kode54>	all of plasma6 will also require quite a number of Qt using apps to be recompiled
Feb 29 12:42:42 <kode54>	some of them need bug fixes too
Feb 29 12:43:01 <kode54>	I asked if it would be conducive to report a bug with recompiling Telegram Desktop against Qt 6.7, but never got an answer
Feb 29 12:43:17 <kode54>	(it compiles and runs, but has an input bug that periodically makes the app lock up)
Feb 29 12:43:41 <arojas>	kode54: no, it won't. Plasma upgrade has nothing to do with Qt upgrade
Feb 29 12:43:58 <kode54>	you mean that the plasma6 upgrade isn't also rolling out at the same time as Qt 6.7?
Feb 29 12:44:14 <arojas>	Qt 6.7 isn't even released yet
Feb 29 12:44:18 <kode54>	oh
Feb 29 12:44:32 <kurtosis>	also afaict, that ^change to /etc/sddm.conf.d/virtualkbd.conf only affects the sddm user login screen, and not the sddm unlocking screen, where the Virtual K/B is still available in the lower left corner
Feb 29 12:44:59 <kode54>	great, so I guess the plasma unstable repo doesn't even make its way directly to testing or stable repos
Feb 29 12:45:13 <kode54>	guess I should be glad I reverted that
Feb 29 12:46:14 <kode54>	some youtube commenter was even under the impression that every major plasma release also coincided with a major Qt release
Feb 29 12:46:25 <thrice>	sddm kinda sounds like a hot mess
Feb 29 12:47:24 <kurtosis>	thrice:  sddm has worked perfectly for many years
Feb 29 12:47:40 <jelle>	kurtosis: I mean some youtuber :P
Feb 29 12:47:53 <mefistofeles>	!give jelle tabfail
Feb 29 12:47:53 <phrik>	jelle:  0  days since the last tab failure. Completion safety is our union goal!
Feb 29 12:48:52 <kurtosis>	mefistofeles:  :D
Feb 29 12:49:11 <thrice>	kurtosis: I guess, it's odd to still not be really wayland ready, halfway to Qt6, etc
Feb 29 12:51:10 <kurtosis>	thrice: noted, but I don't think it's a bug, just a 'be prepared' heads up, and I knew arojas would notice :D
Feb 29 12:51:27 <mefistofeles>	thrice: how is it not wayland ready?
Feb 29 12:51:43 <thrice>	sure, I'm commenting on the project itself, not the packaging
Feb 29 12:51:53 <mefistofeles>	kurtosis: are you saying that the virtual keybard suddenly appears after updating?
Feb 29 12:53:04 <thrice>	mefistofeles: I mean, sddm itself launching without x11
Feb 29 12:54:09 <kurtosis>	I am saying that following a full update and reboot, my previously lovely sddm user login screen was taken over by Virtual Keyboard
Feb 29 12:54:55 <mefistofeles>	kurtosis: hmm I see
Feb 29 12:56:04 <mefistofeles>	thrice: I'm still not following, what's the issue again?
Feb 29 12:56:21 <kurtosis>	post Plasma6 upgrade, now defaults to Wayland, X11 remains availble through the drop-down menu on the sddm user login screen
Feb 29 12:56:36 <mefistofeles>	yeah, exactly
Feb 29 12:57:47 <mefistofeles>	I think there were some problems in the packaging of sddm, though, not including the qt5 greeter, iirc
Feb 29 12:57:59 <thrice>	mefistofeles: it's odd that a wayland-only sddm isn't ready, when plasma6 itself made such a big "improved wayland" release.  I get that they are independent, etc.
Feb 29 12:58:34 <mefistofeles>	actually, not the greeter, the SddmCOmponents
Feb 29 12:58:42 <mefistofeles>	but I think that has been solved, as far as I can tell
Feb 29 12:58:52 <mefistofeles>	arojas on top of things as usual :)
Feb 29 12:59:14 <arojas>	well actually is was a contributed PR
Feb 29 12:59:47 <mefistofeles>	oh yeah
Feb 29 12:59:48 <mefistofeles>	https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/sddm/-/commit/93d4a266c026a9ab1105a91103f86f9b494009e0
Feb 29 12:59:49 <phrik>	Title: Also install qt5 sddm components (93d4a266) · Commits · Arch Linux / Packaging / Packages / sddm · GitLab (at gitlab.archlinux.org)
Feb 29 12:59:58 <mefistofeles>	I remember that user in #kde
Feb 29 13:00:01 <mefistofeles>	cool
Feb 29 13:04:11 <mefistofeles>	thrice: I see, they have been thinking about including sddm into kde, though
Feb 29 13:04:35 <thrice>	worked well for kdm :D
Feb 29 13:04:43 <mefistofeles>	thrice: but, what do you mean by wayland-only?
Feb 29 13:05:27 <thrice>	as in, it works without xorg-server even installed
Feb 29 13:06:10 <thrice>	just for comparison, when gnome migrated to wayland-default, gdm was also ready on day 1, and no X.org processes were needed in the chain
Feb 29 13:06:46 <jal`>	there's still the nvidia blob not really supporting wayland
Feb 29 13:07:00 <jal`>	without some manual effort
Feb 29 13:07:27 <arojas>	note that Plasma itself still doesn't work without xorg
Feb 29 13:07:51 <mefistofeles>	arojas: is that because there are apps using xwayland?
Feb 29 13:08:27 <arojas>	no, speaking about Plasma, not apps
Feb 29 13:08:32 <mefistofeles>	oh right
Feb 29 13:08:46 <MrElendig>	because it links to the xorg libs

Feb 29 15:33:16 <Psi-Jack>	dagle: What paywalls? :p
Feb 29 15:33:46 <dagle>	Psi-Jack: I think there was some thing for their enterprise stuff.
Feb 29 15:34:04 <Psi-Jack>	dagle: Negative.
Feb 29 15:34:16 <Psi-Jack>	Just the propriatery USB add-on support.
Feb 29 15:37:09 <astralc>	and remote RDP
Feb 29 15:37:47 <astralc>	they try to push the oracle cloud in the UI
Feb 29 15:42:05 <Ennea>	gonna ask here as well because the #kde channel is a bit dead at times: so plasma 6 is a thing, and will be out of the testing repo real soon™ i bet. i saw the LWN article on plasma 6 by chance, and it mentions the removal of khotkeys. it's.. pretty much impossible to figure out on the web what khotkeys even _is_ exactly. does anybody happen to know? is it related to the (global) custom
Feb 29 15:42:07 <Ennea>	shortcuts you can create in kde's system settings? is that feature just.. gone in plasma 6?
Feb 29 15:42:41 <Psi-Jack>	Ennea: Yes, and no.
Feb 29 15:43:04 <jelle>	Ennea: it's already in [testing
Feb 29 15:43:24 <Ennea>	jelle, which is why i said it'll probably be out of the testing repo real soon :D
Feb 29 15:43:34 <Ennea>	Psi-Jack, can you elaborate?
Feb 29 15:44:58 <Psi-Jack>	Ennea: khotkeys was for the global keybindings. They just likely moved that to something else to handle it.
Feb 29 15:45:14 <Ennea>	ah, i see. thanks!
Feb 29 15:45:35 <Psi-Jack>	It was becoming unreliable anyway, last I checked, having to hit keybindings for basic things 2~5 times before they'd actually register.
Feb 29 15:45:49 <grawity>	likely to KWin, if I had to guess
Feb 29 15:46:04 <grawity>	as the Wayland compositor is the first to receive keyboard events
Feb 29 15:47:19 <Ennea>	Psi-Jack, oh, i wasn't ever facing that particular issue. are you on wayland?
Feb 29 15:47:35 <Ennea>	grawity, that makes a lot of sense. i gotta deal with wayland at some point, too.. well, a problem for future me :)
Feb 29 15:54:52 <Psi-Jack>	Ennea: I was trying it on both Wayland and X11 when I was evaluating it for a full month in the last 5.x edition. We'll see if 6 can redeem itself. Since 4.0, KDE's been bad enough to drive people far far away from it.
Feb 29 15:55:23 <Ennea>	i've heard many bad things in the past, but i gave KDE a try when i initially switched to linux and been in love ever since
Feb 29 15:55:35 <Ennea>	i use the custom shortcut feature all the time and it has never failed me or not worked so far
Feb 29 15:55:42 <Psi-Jack>	And this race to get to Wayland is also causing it's own stirr of issues. Lotta racing to it, neglecting what they have, and leaving behind everyone else.
Feb 29 15:55:51 <Psi-Jack>	Ennea: I used KDE for 20 years.
Feb 29 15:56:10 <Psi-Jack>	Well, 19, almost 20 years. :)
Feb 29 15:57:08 <Ennea>	sorry to hear you're having more trouble than me
Feb 29 15:57:10 <Ennea>	:p
Feb 29 15:57:47 <Psi-Jack>	hah. I'm not. I just backed off to Xfce for the forseabale future. Took a bit of effort to get similar functionality, but I managed it.
Feb 29 15:59:33 <rainbowtux>	hi all, considering archlinux for work, how would one trigger a rebuild of a package if its dependencies were updated? How is this detected for the archlinux repos?
Feb 29 15:59:56 <Psi-Jack>	rainbowtux: A rebuild? I'm assuming you mean AUR?
Feb 29 15:59:58 <espresso>	just speaking for myself, have used Plasma about as long as Arch, 10y(?) and only remember 1 or 2 minor issues and one was Qt5's fault resolved in Qt6
Feb 29 16:00:44 <Psi-Jack>	espresso: Heh. I saw annoyances mostly /while/ using KDE, but it's when I fully moved away that I saw all the issues for what they were. Basically, being blinded by it.
Feb 29 16:00:47 <grawity>	rainbowtux: for packages that are in the repos, the packagers themselves do the rebuild (sogrep and other scripts) and you get it all at once
Feb 29 16:00:54 <rainbowtux>	Psi-Jack: could be AUR but moving forward, probably own internal repo in company... and would be nice if rebuilds are triggered automagically when needed :)
Feb 29 16:01:09 <grawity>	rainbowtux: for locally built packages like AUR, good luck
Feb 29 16:01:10 <Psi-Jack>	rainbowtux: Well, AUR stuff is on your own. 
Feb 29 16:01:26 <grawity>	it would be possible to script that though
Feb 29 16:01:40 <rainbowtux>	grawity: ah ok, so there is no build server which detects dependency updates and triggers rebuilds? coming from opensuse with OBS, hence the question
Feb 29 16:02:09 <rainbowtux>	we have 50+ packages of in-house developed components, so automation is key :)
Feb 29 16:02:11 <grawity>	there's no real build server in general, at the moment
Feb 29 16:02:11 <Psi-Jack>	No worries about actual Arch Linux repos. But yeah. Nothing will "autodetect" the need to rebuild. I run my own aurto server, and every so often, I check on my packages built by it, and rebuild when something's clearly not working as intended.
Feb 29 16:02:34 <Psi-Jack>	grawity: Well, there's aurto. :)
Feb 29 16:02:54 <grawity>	not one that would handle regular arch packaging
Feb 29 16:03:19 <grawity>	there's still some manual involvement in builds, afaik, and therefore also in rebuilds
Feb 29 16:04:10 <grawity>	one of the devs did have a system specifically for rebuilds but iirc it still needed to be fed a list of targets from ... was it `sogrep`?
Feb 29 16:04:13 <grawity>	?pkgfile sogrep
Feb 29 16:04:15 <EMIYA>	grawity: extra/devtools 1:1.1.1-1 (/usr/bin/sogrep, /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/sogrep)
Feb 29 16:04:19 <rainbowtux>	ok... bit of a pity but good to know... not that we have fully automated builts at the moment (yet), but most of our solution being on debian, it changes rarely... moving forward with a rolling release and 50+ packages, you see how it quickly becomes painful :)
Feb 29 16:04:19 <grawity>	yeah probably that
Feb 29 16:04:29 <espresso>	Psi-Jack: nice that you got Xfce working just how you like. I thought I might try the same with..maybe that or lxqt
Feb 29 16:04:55 <rainbowtux>	will have a look at sogrep etc
Feb 29 16:04:55 <Psi-Jack>	espresso: Yeah, basically xfce with xfdashboard, and autorandr, with blueberry for bluetooth, since blueman was acting up. 
Feb 29 16:05:53 <Psi-Jack>	I've literally always had Xfce in my back pocket though, back when it was a CDE-like clone.
Feb 29 16:06:28 <colo>	I switched back to KDE Plasma from Xfce, after having escaped to Xfce from the then-broken KDE 4. but I do not regret either choice :)
Feb 29 16:07:02 <colo>	I do fear for all the tiny WMs and smaller DEs that are being threatened by the switch to wayland
Feb 29 16:07:20 <colo>	it's a mess, and all for so little gain :(
Feb 29 16:07:27 <Psi-Jack>	colo: Heh. I broke free of KDE to GNOME, myself. Opened my eyes quite a bit. But. No world of DE is perfect, this I knwo.
Feb 29 16:07:50 <Psi-Jack>	I'm waiting to see what COSMIC DE is like. I honestly have this feeling that will be an awesome new thing that I might actually like for once.
Feb 29 16:07:58 <colo>	I have GNOME on a 13" tablet. if that UX is what they broke GNOME 2 for, their users got a bad deal.
Feb 29 16:08:18 <Psi-Jack>	Per-display independent workspaces, per-workspace auto-tiling functionality settings.
Feb 29 16:08:35 <jelle>	ah COSMIC DE, NiH syndrome
Feb 29 16:08:37 *	jelle removes channel operator status from jelle
Feb 29 16:09:03 <Psi-Jack>	colo: Well, GNOME 46 works *great* on touchscreen, this much I can say for sure. Getting Xfce working on touchscreen is kind of a royal PITA.
Feb 29 16:09:22 <colo>	Psi-Jack: I am not sure which version I have. whatever is in latest Fedora.
Feb 29 16:09:49 <espresso>	colo: that's one reason I am not rioting for Wayland now on every DE.. it takes time
Feb 29 16:10:13 <Psi-Jack>	colo: 46, I'm sure. :)
Feb 29 16:10:41 <colo>	espresso: but it's already been in the making for ages...
Feb 29 16:11:00 <colo>	but yeah, things def. are moving these years
Feb 29 16:11:15 <colo>	my work setup got a KDE Plasma wayland session set up by default which I did not even notice
Feb 29 16:11:24 <colo>	(using Debian 12 with amdgpu)
Feb 29 16:12:09 <Psi-Jack>	Yeah. The way I currently see wayland is, GNOME and literally racing to Wayland and ignoring all X11 issues in the process, abandoning it outright. KDE's following suit and basically now doing the same thing. Meanwhile, everyone else, Cinnamon, Xfce, Budgie, Pantheon, etc... Are either playing catchup from the dust, or waaaaaaaayyy behind, and it
Feb 29 16:12:10 <Psi-Jack>	gets worse than that, applications that only work on X11 are still a big thing, and half of those won't work on XWayland due to the nature of Wayland itself. 
Feb 29 16:12:30 <Psi-Jack>	I'm all for Wayland, but holy hell, I'm not out to win competitions with it.
Feb 29 16:13:46 <avu>	what X applications don't work in XWayland? I just switched a few weeks ago and so far all legacy applications just work
Feb 29 16:14:18 <cornduck>	ive mounted some samba shares the /etc/fstab way with lines like this: https://termbin.com/2prl problem is that it now takes a long time to boot... is there a proper way to do this
Feb 29 16:15:55 <cornduck>	i could create a script that runs after i've logged in
Feb 29 16:16:09 <Psi-Jack>	avu: Those, especially, that deal with keyboard and mouse, for one. Input-Leap is WIP, but GNOME advertised it's support before it was ready, dick move on their part. There's others, too, especially if you're dealing with remapping keys like in input-mapper
Feb 29 16:16:44 <Psi-Jack>	cornduck: automount would also be a lot safer.
Feb 29 16:16:57 <Psi-Jack>	And not using password= in plain text in the fstab, too.
Feb 29 16:17:16 <Psi-Jack>	Preferring a much higher version number than 2.0 extremely important, as well.
Feb 29 16:17:28 <espresso>	cornduck: you could add any of noauto, bg, timeout=<seconds>
Feb 29 16:18:03 <Psi-Jack>	And is the other end running Windows or SAMBA as well? This matters because of POSIX extensions and those choice uses of "dir_mode" and "file_mode"
Feb 29 16:18:15 <avu>	Psi-Jack: okay, that sounds more like some specialty cases than "half of them" as you originally claimed
Feb 29 16:18:40 <avu>	still sucks of course
Feb 29 16:18:54 <espresso>	cornduck: 'bg' might be ideal if it works as I assume
Feb 29 16:18:55 <Psi-Jack>	avu: I mean, there's also proton, proton-ge, wine, and such for the people that also like to enjoy games, and the lag in XWayland is real.
Feb 29 16:19:43 <Psi-Jack>	cornduck: Also, _netdev would identify it as a network mounted filesystem, very important.
Feb 29 16:20:04 <espresso>	also assuming there's no 'problem' to fix.. I also use _netdev
Feb 29 16:20:08 <avu>	Psi-Jack: so far I haven't noticed any lags or problems with games but maybe I was just lucky
Feb 29 16:20:24 <avu>	or Sway is a better compositor than whatever GNOME uses
Feb 29 16:21:03 <Psi-Jack>	avu: I saw extensive lag scenarios in many games, Medieval Dynasty in full graphical details, for example. And that was in GNOME Wayland versus GNOME X11 and Xfce.
Feb 29 16:21:51 <avu>	it's certainly a bummer that the transition is taking so long and that X has completely stopped development before Wayland was really ready for prime time
Feb 29 16:22:26 <avu>	yet another sign that desktop Linux is basically an afterthought
Feb 29 16:22:33 <Psi-Jack>	Well, Xorg's development being stopped is not a surprise, It's not needing much updates in it's current state. It does still receive SOME updates, where necessary, but new things are held back mostly. 
Feb 29 16:23:12 <Psi-Jack>	Xfce's already got a lot of it's stuff Wayland capable, but the biggest factors, the session manager being I think the biggest component still needed to migrate. 
Feb 29 16:23:30 <jelle>	avu: linux desktop isn't an afterthought, there are just limited people working on it
Feb 29 16:23:31 <Psi-Jack>	And the window-manager itself.
Feb 29 16:23:50 <avu>	jelle: the latter is a result of the former I'd say
Feb 29 16:23:50 <Psi-Jack>	jelle: Correct. 
Feb 29 16:24:08 <Psi-Jack>	avu: No, the latter is a result of variety, in some sense.
Feb 29 16:24:14 <Psi-Jack>	Splintering efforts.
Feb 29 16:24:34 <Psi-Jack>	How many forks of dwm are there now today, for example? 
Feb 29 16:24:57 <avu>	what variety? The whole ecosystem agrees that Wayland is the way forward, no?
Feb 29 16:25:11 <avu>	still it's taking ages to even achieve feature parity
Feb 29 16:25:40 <jelle>	avu: what feature parity is missing?
Feb 29 16:25:42 <Psi-Jack>	avu: Over 6 years now.
Feb 29 16:25:49 <avu>	the whole concept of "everyone has to implement the whole thing themseleves" is certainly part of the problem
Feb 29 16:26:17 <Psi-Jack>	Yeah, the way Wayland works as a "protocol" is definitely a very daunting method to have taken. 
Feb 29 16:26:40 <Psi-Jack>	Does it allow a lot of functionality to be done as a result? Yes. But at the cost of higher development requirements, especially in porting over.
Feb 29 16:27:07 <cornduck>	interesting Psi-Jack espresso 
Feb 29 16:27:09 <avu>	jelle: we still need XWayland to have a working desktop, no?
Feb 29 16:27:28 <jelle>	avu: only for games for me, but that is fine imo
Feb 29 16:27:35 <jelle>	you always will have legacy applications
Feb 29 16:27:40 <Psi-Jack>	cornduck: Some research points to look into.
Feb 29 16:28:24 <avu>	granted, for me it's mostly commercial applications as well, yet another sign that for all those companies, desktop Linux is at least a bit of an afterthought
Feb 29 16:28:47 <Psi-Jack>	Heh, to get my drop-down terminal I like, I had to turn to tdrop, which kinda works on Wayland..... but doesn't fully and completely, because it does rely on X11-based CLI tools for how it works.
Feb 29 16:28:49 <avu>	jetbrains IDEs, Spotify, Discord, the list goes on
Feb 29 16:29:25 <Psi-Jack>	I use tdrop also now for Discord and Ferdium, my two communication clients. I hide/show them with Super+1|2 now, so I can use both displays again for multi-tasking more broadly. :)
Feb 29 17:16:37 <Soni>	can you setup RAID1 on live drives?
Feb 29 17:18:13 <Psi-Jack>	Soni: Your question does not make sense.
Feb 29 17:18:34 <rcf>	Soni: on btrfs? Yes. Provided you meet the obvious space constraints. 
Feb 29 17:18:50 <Soni>	rcf: on dm-raid
Feb 29 17:19:40 <Soni>	say you have a drive. you're using it. you want to migrate to raid1. can you do it?
Feb 29 17:23:44 <rcf>	From what level? 
Feb 29 17:23:58 <Psi-Jack>	Heh. Maybe pixie dust/
Feb 29 17:24:11 <rcf>	You can do this, but there are restrictions. 
Feb 29 17:24:33 <rcf>	Soni: see https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/A_guide_to_mdadm#Array_internals_and_how_it_affects_mdadm
Feb 29 17:24:35 <phrik>	Title: A guide to mdadm - Linux Raid Wiki (at raid.wiki.kernel.org)
Feb 29 17:24:59 <Soni>	rcf: from RAID-N/A
Feb 29 17:25:08 <Soni>	("not applicable")
Feb 29 17:25:32 <rcf>	If the superblocks aren't already configured I don't think you can do that. 
Feb 29 17:27:02 <rcf>	You can mess around with an existing array because the filesystem isn't expecting anything about the underlying raw disk layout, but if it doesn't exist, you won't have a good time. 
Feb 29 17:28:57 <Soni>	okay so we want the --build option?
Feb 29 17:30:46 <rcf>	I wouldn't recommend it. 
Feb 29 17:34:27 <lmat>	It looks like the latest mesa upgrade broke my X system (I use xfce4). upgraded mesa (1:23.3.5-1 -> 1:24.0.1-1). Downgrading that package allows me to `startx`. What should I do next to make Free Software better?
Feb 29 17:35:11 <mefistofeles>	lmat: what's the error when starting with the latest mesa?
Feb 29 17:37:44 <lmat>	Segmentation fault: https://paste.rs/JxYIZ. I don't have the Xorg logs anymore in ~/.local/share/xorg.

Feb 29 17:44:35 <lmat>	Namarrgon: Thank you for the pointer, that doesn't look quite the same. "when running any GTK app" sounds like he's getting much further along than me. Mine crashes at `startx`. Then again maybe my `startx` is running a gtk app on startup...
Feb 29 17:47:01 <gromit>	lmat: could you do a coredumpctl gdb -1 and show us the output? Please also say yes when it asks you about using debuginfod
Feb 29 17:49:17 <gromit>	ah and once your are in the gdb shell do a bt full
Feb 29 17:54:54 <lmat>	gromit: Sorry, that took longer than it should have: https://paste.rs/6hSNv (I guess being in a meeting while trying to get this put together slows me down a little, too ^_^)
Feb 29 17:55:41 <gromit>	lmat: that is just the top, please answer yes and wait fore the download to finish
Feb 29 17:55:59 <gromit>	then do a "bt full" in the gdb prompt
Feb 29 17:56:19 <lmat>	bt full is https://paste.rs/vbMvV. I'll do it all again with 'y'!
Feb 29 17:56:44 <gromit>	lmat: yeah its pretty worthless without debug info x) 
Feb 29 17:57:09 <lmat>	That's what I thought, but maybe there are some wizards somewhere who can convert those memory offsets to function names in their head xD
Feb 29 18:03:32 <lmat>	Still downloading. I'm on a slow connection and it seems like a lot of data.

Feb 29 18:36:39 <mefistofeles>	lmat: somebody posted problems with mesa and radeon as well
Feb 29 18:36:50 <mefistofeles>	lmat: which one are you actually using for display?
Feb 29 18:37:05 <lmat>	mefistofeles: Radeon. It works better.
Feb 29 18:38:07 <Vorpal>	So, what are the plans about the recently released KDE6? I have noticed in recent months that a lot of KDE packages were renamed to have a "5" in the name. So I guess we will be able to install both side by side at least for a limited time?
Feb 29 18:38:21 <jclsn>	gromit: Thanks 😄
Feb 29 18:38:36 <Scimmia>	lmat: except it gets very little testing, as radeon is only for pretty old cards

Feb 29 18:39:25 <teraflops>	plasma 6, more hype than with dune part 2
Feb 29 18:39:39 <Scimmia>	lmat: are you actually on pre-GCN?
Feb 29 18:39:43 <lmat>	gromit: still downloading.
Feb 29 18:39:45 <Vorpal>	Scimmia: I wasn't asking for a release date, just "how will it break once it comes"

Feb 29 18:40:11 <archetech>	it rocks do not fear it!
Feb 29 18:40:40 <Vorpal>	Scimmia: and that just means I should keep asking, I would prefer it to mature for a bit before being hit by tons of breaking changes.
Feb 29 18:41:04 <archetech>	that bs
Feb 29 18:41:16 <archetech>	if it breaks a fix comes fast as usual
Feb 29 18:41:22 <Scimmia>	lmat: looks like GCN1, so you can switch to amdgpu
Feb 29 18:41:42 <Vorpal>	archetech: sure, that bot thing Scimmia did just rubbed me the wrong way. Since I wasn't even asking about that.
Feb 29 18:41:50 <lmat>	Scimmia: Oh, great! I'll look into that, thank you!
Feb 29 18:43:01 <espresso>	Vorpal: I presume the Plasma 5 deps are renamed mainly so 6 can take those names
Feb 29 18:43:03 <Scimmia>	lmat: verify that, I just looked up the 2 cards Dell listed for that model, one is GCN3, which would use amdgpu by default, so I assumed you had the other
Feb 29 18:43:37 <archetech>	just leave v5 in the dust

Feb 29 18:44:13 <lmat>	Scimmia: I thought I remember looking this up and amdgpu was not an option, but that definitely may have been a different computer, or my error, or...

Mar 01 01:59:40 *	Topic for #archlinux set by phrik!~phrik@phrik.archlinux.org (Sat Feb 10 18:25:44 2024)
Mar 01 03:50:55 <arno_>	in order to use testing repos, all I need is to uncomment the two lines for  [testing]  in pacman.conf?
Mar 01 03:51:05 <arno_>	Will it enable testing both for core and extra?
Mar 01 03:52:12 <mpan>	arno_: yes, these are testing repos for core and extra.
Mar 01 03:52:45 <edu4rdshl>	arno_, also multilib if you're using it
Mar 01 03:53:18 <Scimmia>	arno_: if you still have one called [testing], check you pacnews
Mar 01 03:53:43 <Scimmia>	that repo hasn't existed for what, 8-10 months?
Mar 01 03:53:54 <arno_>	oh, right
Mar 01 03:54:18 <corysanin>	[core-testing], [extra-testing], and their corresponding Include lines.
Mar 01 03:54:54 *	mpan assumed this is what arno_ meant by “two lines”. Hmm
Mar 01 03:55:18 <Scimmia>	there's two lines for each, though
Mar 01 03:55:27 <mpan>	True
Mar 01 03:55:56 <corysanin>	That's why I was a little more verbose :D
Mar 01 03:56:33 <Scimmia>	also need to deal with community if the pacnew was never merged
Mar 01 03:56:55 <espresso>	I was always relying on archlinux.org for the pacnews, so I missed the removal of testing.
Mar 01 03:57:19 <Scimmia>	espresso: by pacnews, we mean pacnew files plural, not news
Mar 01 03:57:20 <mpan>	espresso: a .pacnew was delivered for that.

Mar 01 03:57:58 <espresso>	haha, ah! I usually merge those but missed one testing entry
Mar 01 03:58:09 <arno_>	yes, I also changed [community] to [extra]. Thanks for the tip
Mar 01 03:59:17 <Scimmia>	always pay attention when pacman tells you about a pacnew file
Mar 01 03:59:51 <edu4rdshl>	pacdiff ftw
Mar 01 04:29:16 <KitsuWhooa>	Is there a way to be notified when an issue is closed for a package in gitlab.archlinux.org?
Mar 01 04:30:07 <edu4rdshl>	KitsuWhooa, if you created it, you'll get notified
Mar 01 04:30:12 <edu4rdshl>	Or if you participated
Mar 01 04:30:48 <KitsuWhooa>	I can't make an account there, can I?
Mar 01 04:31:08 <KitsuWhooa>	(it's not my issue)
Mar 01 04:31:50 <KitsuWhooa>	oh I'm dumb, I didn't read the text in the login page
Mar 01 04:32:02 <edu4rdshl>	You can send an email to accountsupport@archlinux.org
Mar 01 04:32:05 <KitsuWhooa>	yeah, sorry
Mar 01 04:42:55 <espresso>	whether I try to login or reset pasword, accounts.archlinux is asking me for a "one-time code"
Mar 01 04:43:12 <Scimmia>	yep, 2fa is required
Mar 01 04:43:28 <espresso>	I forgot. It was that kind of week. :P
Mar 01 04:46:09 <espresso>	KitsuWhooa: I think you can simply turn on Issue notifications with the ... button when viewing one
Mar 01 04:51:06 <KitsuWhooa>	Yeah. The problem was I didn't have an account. I sent an email so I'll subscribe to it once I can log in
Mar 01 04:51:15 <KitsuWhooa>	thanks!
Mar 01 04:52:00 <espresso>	oh, you did say that. right!
Mar 01 05:39:55 <[-_-]>	Guys, does avahi interfere with wifi connection ?
Mar 01 05:40:03 <[-_-]>	making it unstable ?
Mar 01 05:41:48 <virtualsid>	it should not
Mar 01 05:42:09 <virtualsid>	What are you experiencing, and what makes you think it might be avahi?
Mar 01 05:42:29 <[-_-]>	I don't know
Mar 01 05:42:42 <[-_-]>	is there some way I could determine what is causing it?
Mar 01 05:43:15 <[-_-]>	my network is unstable
Mar 01 05:43:25 <[-_-]>	I am talking to you from a second computer
Mar 01 05:43:33 <[-_-]>	yet the other one says no internet
Mar 01 05:43:39 <[-_-]>	we are not the same network
Mar 01 05:43:40 <kevr>	so is your network unstable, or is one computer having issues?
Mar 01 05:43:46 <[-_-]>	^
Mar 01 05:44:17 <[-_-]>	okay, correction, since I am talking to you, my network is definitely stable, the problem is with the other one
Mar 01 05:44:36 <[-_-]>	meaning the other system running avahi on arch
Mar 01 05:44:46 <kevr>	as virtualsid asked, what makes you believe that?
Mar 01 05:44:57 <kevr>	like, what specific things have you done and experienced the network issues on
Mar 01 05:46:01 <[-_-]>	I am watching video on youtube, and it sometimes don't buffer, pacman stops downlading packages in the middle (this don't hurt, pacman can resume), flatpak also stops downloading (it seems, flatpak can't resume)
Mar 01 05:46:27 <kevr>	gotcha
Mar 01 05:46:27 <[-_-]>	these are happening often, say 50 or 60 times a day that I notice
Mar 01 05:46:39 <[-_-]>	it just happened again
Mar 01 05:46:42 <[-_-]>	dammit
Mar 01 05:46:56 <[-_-]>	but this system is working (weechat)
Mar 01 05:47:05 <kevr>	well
Mar 01 05:47:28 <kevr>	it is possible that your connection is dropping but weechat is just recovering, it does that pretty nicely with some timeout
Mar 01 05:47:52 <[-_-]>	yeah, but oftentimes it doesn't even report lag
Mar 01 05:48:03 <kevr>	perhaps you could try the same downloads on this machine to see if the same issues happen or something, the honest truth is that there are so many factors that could affect that
Mar 01 05:48:27 <kevr>	isp, modem, local router, local machine
Mar 01 05:48:42 <[-_-]>	okkie dokey
Mar 01 05:48:45 <kevr>	and inside the local machine depending on your network stack, the entire part of the stack that's involved
Mar 01 05:49:14 <kevr>	so it becomes a problem that can't be answered simply in this general case, we need more of a narrow focus, or we need to spend hours or days going through every piece with you
Mar 01 05:49:17 <virtualsid>	anything in journalctl or dmesg? If you think it's hardware/machine related, you might see something in the logs, when following.
Mar 01 05:49:27 <virtualsid>	(when following dmesg/journalctl)
Mar 01 05:50:35 <kevr>	if i were you, i would begin eliminating factors in the equation if logs can't help you out much
Mar 01 05:50:54 <kevr>	try to isolate what is causing it and look there
Mar 01 05:51:12 <[-_-]>	okay, I will turn of all other device
Mar 01 05:51:18 <[-_-]>	and see where that takes me
Mar 01 05:51:20 <virtualsid>	Yeah, definitely try to eliminate things first, guessing is going to hurt :)
Mar 01 05:51:23 <kevr>	+1
Mar 01 05:51:29 <virtualsid>	Good idea!
Mar 01 05:52:45 <virtualsid>	hey, I had a question too - I'm looking to install lutris, and it had xdg-desktop-portal-impl as a dependency. Looking at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal and I'm wondering 'wtf do I choose, if I'm using i3/xorg' :)
Mar 01 05:52:47 <phrik>	Title: XDG Desktop Portal - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Mar 01 05:53:11 <kevr>	i use xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
Mar 01 05:53:23 <kevr>	works fine
Mar 01 05:53:36 <kevr>	(also i3/xorg)
Mar 01 05:53:43 <virtualsid>	heh, I was wondering about that one, or the lxqt one.
Mar 01 05:53:50 <virtualsid>	I'll go with gtk too then
Mar 01 05:54:28 <virtualsid>	thanks kevr
Mar 01 05:54:38 <kevr>	no problem! \o/
Mar 01 05:55:34 <virtualsid>	I forgot that this laptop is a bit poo for downloads on wireless. peaks at ~30Mb/s. This download might take a while :P
Mar 01 05:59:06 <mefistofeles>	virtualsid: why is that? bad hardware or controllers?
Mar 01 06:00:03 <virtualsid>	Linux driver probably. Wired ethernet is fine, and I've managed to get speed tests of around 300Mb/s on Windoze
Mar 01 06:00:18 <mefistofeles>	virtualsid: what wifi card is it?
Mar 01 06:00:25 <virtualsid>	one sec.
Mar 01 06:00:45 <mefistofeles>	I mean, if you want to get into it, I probably won't be of much help, but I'm just curious
Mar 01 06:00:50 <virtualsid>	Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 31)
Mar 01 06:01:01 <mefistofeles>	ah atheros hmm
Mar 01 06:01:21 <virtualsid>	I've already been into it a fair bit, I think I exhausted my own abilities, and I might need to investigate the driver code, and I do not know if a) I would even be able to understand it, or b) whether I want to try :-D
Mar 01 06:02:04 <virtualsid>	When first investigating, I found a post about it, with slightly similar results. The post was marked 'SOLVED'. How? By replacing the card in the laptop :-D
Mar 01 06:02:24 <virtualsid>	actually, I'm guessing it was a laptop. Maybe it wasn't... hmm
Mar 01 06:03:55 <virtualsid>	I do see a large increase in TX errors, when monitoring the /sys/stat thingy for the card/connection, as well as on wavemon, which is far easier to read.
Mar 01 06:04:40 <mefistofeles>	virtualsid: hmm, yeah, no idea :/ 
Mar 01 06:04:56 <arno_>	That's weird, I just posted a question here one hour ago, and right after, someone commented on an issue on gitlab that I am participating in. Claiming that, since I am asking beginner questions on irc (in their view), my bug report must not be valid.
Mar 01 06:05:31 <arno_>	At first, I thought it was a maintainer of the package. I dindn't realize it was someone totally new in the conversation.
Mar 01 06:05:37 <mefistofeles>	arno_: haters gonna hate
Mar 01 06:05:46 <virtualsid>	arno_: huh, wtf
Mar 01 06:05:50 <arno_>	Now, I find that a little unsettling
Mar 01 06:08:34 <kevr>	which package?
Mar 01 06:13:59 <mefistofeles>	kevr: eager to know the drama?
Mar 01 06:14:00 <mefistofeles>	:P
Mar 01 06:15:48 <virtualsid>	I am quite curious and nosey too :P
Mar 01 06:17:10 <kevr>	just wanna thumbs down the comment if that really happened, seems counterproductive to looking at the bug
Mar 01 06:21:49 <mefistofeles>	kevr: maybe that gives it the attention they are looking for? Sometimes that happens
Mar 01 06:24:20 <kevr>	yeah, you're right
Mar 01 06:38:35 <[-_-]>	guys, is mac spoofing default on arch ?
Mar 01 06:39:43 <Scimmia>	that's not an Arch thing, it depends on how you manage your network
Mar 01 06:40:22 <[-_-]>	does iwd do this by default ?
Mar 01 06:43:13 <bookworm>	if only there'd be a way to check
Mar 01 06:45:33 <[-_-]>	something is changing the mac address
Mar 01 06:45:38 <[-_-]>	and it is not iwd
Mar 01 06:45:44 <mefistofeles>	wow
Mar 01 06:45:47 <[-_-]>	I set it to disabled
Mar 01 06:45:49 <mefistofeles>	that doesn't sound good
Mar 01 06:48:34 <NetSysFire>	what happened to the baloo package? i see theres now a baloo5. is it discontinued or something? asking to fix broken package links in the wiki
Mar 01 06:50:00 <mefistofeles>	I know NetSysFire is ignoring me, but maybe somebody can let them know that many/all packages were renamed to "5" before the kde 6 release
Mar 01 06:50:59 <[-_-]>	O_o
Mar 01 06:51:31 <mefistofeles>	lol
Mar 01 06:53:19 <arno_>	mefistofeles: yeah you are right. I'd rather not post the link or package name
Mar 01 06:53:24 <arno_>	I've reported the user or gitlab
Mar 01 06:53:35 <mefistofeles>	arno_: yeah, that's good, should be enough
Mar 01 06:53:56 <arno_>	and you are still on the channel and read that: Don't do those kind of things again. It's pretty upsetting, and can discourage people to contribute to the project.
Mar 01 06:55:22 <NetSysFire>	yeah thats an asshole move
Mar 01 06:58:22 <NetSysFire>	arno_: do you still see this user in here? you may want to poke our ops
Mar 01 06:59:16 <mefistofeles>	I don't think penalizing the user here for something it's done elsewhere is the way to go :/ at all
Mar 01 07:02:41 <[-_-]>	guys, there is record of dhcpcd, old hardware address, new hardware address ....
Mar 01 07:02:51 <[-_-]>	does this mean dhcpcd can change address ?
Mar 01 07:04:28 <mefistofeles>	[-_-]: I think it can, but that's not a common behavior, that would be something you have to manually configure , as far as I can tell
Mar 01 07:04:44 <[-_-]>	:o
Mar 01 07:05:14 <mefistofeles>	let me ask something, just to be sure... [-_-] , how are you checking the mac address?
Mar 01 07:06:19 <[-_-]>	looking inside the router web interface, comparing iwgtk reported macaddress, ip
Mar 01 07:06:43 <[-_-]>	ip link
Mar 01 07:07:05 <[-_-]>	ip link also reports parmanent address
Mar 01 07:07:50 <mefistofeles>	I'm confused, so does ip link report a fixed address? As opposed to iwgtk?
Mar 01 07:10:18 <[-_-]>	https://dpaste.com/EAPSKBGR8
Mar 01 07:10:29 <[-_-]>	ip link reports two address
Mar 01 07:10:39 <[-_-]>	that is my dhcpcd.conf
Mar 01 07:10:44 <mefistofeles>	can you repaste using a saner provider?
Mar 01 07:10:47 <mefistofeles>	!pastebin
Mar 01 07:10:47 <phrik>	Pastebin.com is swamped with advertisements, random captchas, mangles the input and is blocked for some users. Please, use something sane like https://gist.github.com https://bpaste.net https://0x0.st and see !0x0 for an easy way to paste from the cli.
Mar 01 07:11:03 <mefistofeles>	firefox blocks it
Mar 01 07:12:02 <[-_-]>	https://paste.debian.net/plain/1309108
Mar 01 07:12:48 <mefistofeles>	[-_-]: what's the output of ip?
Mar 01 07:12:59 <mefistofeles>	maybe want to share that privately, though 
Mar 01 07:13:16 <mefistofeles>	I mean `ip link`
Mar 01 07:13:49 <[-_-]>	-_-
Mar 01 07:14:18 <mefistofeles>	[   ]
Mar 01 07:16:45 <[-_-]>	https://paste.debian.net/plain/1309109
Mar 01 07:18:14 <[-_-]>	permaddr is the real one
Mar 01 07:18:28 <[-_-]>	 the one after link/ether is the generated one
Mar 01 07:24:03 <mefistofeles>	[-_-]: I don't see any 
Mar 01 07:24:05 <mefistofeles>	hmm
Mar 01 07:24:22 <mefistofeles>	[-_-]: I don't see any `permaddr` in my `ip link` output, so you probably have a custom config or something
Mar 01 07:25:29 <[-_-]>	oky, this it fixed
Mar 01 07:25:40 <[-_-]>	I got it fixed, it was dhcpcd
Mar 01 07:25:44 <mefistofeles>	[-_-]: ok, how?
Mar 01 07:25:58 <[-_-]>	duid in dhcpcd.conf
Mar 01 07:26:21 <[-_-]>	commented it out and enabled clientid
Mar 01 07:26:23 <mefistofeles>	[-_-]: I see
Mar 01 07:27:02 <mefistofeles>	I have duid in my dhcpcd conf, but I'm not using dhcpcd
Mar 01 07:28:56 <[-_-]>	what are you using then ?
Mar 01 07:29:16 <[-_-]>	and I wasted this morning on arch
Mar 01 07:29:49 <[-_-]>	I am not sure if this is the problem with unstable internet though
Mar 01 07:30:54 <mefistofeles>	[-_-]: I use networkmanager
Mar 01 07:47:09 <espresso>	[-_-]: I do dislike wasting time! If you're looking through net managers, https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-networkd is easy enough and seems reliable
Mar 01 07:47:10 <phrik>	Title: systemd-networkd - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Mar 01 07:49:11 <kevr>	[-_-]: there is a program called macchanger that lets you change a device's mac to whatever you want, and if that is done, a dhcp router will definitely want to lease you an address for that spoofed mac, perhaps you have some sort of software changing your mac on a regular basis, could cause that
Mar 01 07:49:15 <edu4rdshl>	arno_, that's me, and I'm basically saying that your proposal will cause issues because it's trying to recreate something that's already created
Mar 01 07:49:27 <kevr>	oh, sorry, you fixed it
Mar 01 07:49:31 <kevr>	nice
Mar 01 07:49:43 <edu4rdshl>	And it's nothing else than the /dev/nvidia0 device
Mar 01 07:50:50 <edu4rdshl>	Also, what I said was: you don't know what are pacnews/pacsaves (you has a pacman.conf with unmerged changes from at least 10 months), you dont know how to enable testing repos on Arch (even when the wiki says how), and now you came with a broken PR
Mar 01 07:50:53 <edu4rdshl>	So...
Mar 01 07:51:08 <edu4rdshl>	You are not just affecting yourself with that PR but anyone who uses nvidia 
Mar 01 08:02:53 <BetweenUs>	Can't believe that that I can't find solution for mirror monitor and projector. Can't be reached with hyprland, kanshi, wlr-randr...
Mar 01 08:04:22 <edu4rdshl>	BetweenUs, what are you even trying to say? You want to have the same thing on a second monitor or what?
Mar 01 08:05:52 <BetweenUs>	yes edu4rdshl 
Mar 01 08:06:01 <edu4rdshl>	https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors/#mirrored-displays this?
Mar 01 08:06:02 <phrik>	Title: Monitors | Hyprland Wiki (at wiki.hyprland.org)
Mar 01 08:10:46 <BetweenUs>	I will try at the moment. Can I try from terminal, hyprctl...? And what will happened when the other monitor/projector is not plugged-in?
Mar 01 08:11:32 <edu4rdshl>	I have no idea about hyprland but there's the documentation
Mar 01 08:12:28 <BetweenUs>	ok, thank you.
Mar 01 08:12:47 <edu4rdshl>	They do have a Discord server tho
Mar 01 08:14:17 <jelle>	just beaware of all the toxicity
Mar 01 08:15:28 <BetweenUs>	can't reach the server. They have phone number verifycation which doesn't work. 
Mar 01 08:15:36 <edu4rdshl>	Uuh
Mar 01 08:24:59 <arojas>	NetSysFire: baloo is in testing
Mar 01 08:25:17 <NetSysFire>	yes but why was it renamed?
Mar 01 08:25:21 <NetSysFire>	or this a temporary measure?
Mar 01 08:26:10 <makendo>	isn't baloo the kde indexing daemon already present in plasma 5
Mar 01 08:30:12 <NetSysFire>	yes but it was previously called baloo, now the package vanished but baloo5 appeared?
Mar 01 08:30:26 <NetSysFire>	i dont even want to use it, i just want to fix the broken link in the wiki
Mar 01 08:31:37 <arojas>	NetSysFire: all KDE frameworks were renamed to make room for KF6
Mar 01 08:31:43 <NetSysFire>	ah
Mar 01 08:32:14 <NetSysFire>	i guess that is effectively temporary
Mar 01 08:33:50 <akik>	NetSysFire: you don't have balooctl?
Mar 01 08:34:04 <NetSysFire>	read the backlog. its about the wiki
Mar 01 08:34:27 <akik>	NetSysFire: i don't see any link from you
Mar 01 08:34:38 <NetSysFire>	that doesnt mean the broken link doesnt exist
Mar 01 08:34:44 <akik>	how matrix of you
Mar 01 08:37:04 <[-_-]>	espresso & kevr  thank you
Mar 01 08:42:13 <[-_-]>	espresso: I am happy with iwd
Mar 01 08:42:37 <[-_-]>	for now
Mar 01 09:06:20 <B-|>	ew matrix. long live xmpp
Mar 01 09:06:45 <B-|>	is there a package that symlinks 7zip to zip and unzip?
Mar 01 09:07:09 <NetSysFire>	why do you ask? do you need something like this or are you debugging something that sets these symlinks?
Mar 01 09:07:34 <B-|>	i would like zip files that work everywhere
Mar 01 09:07:46 <edu4rdshl>	What
Mar 01 09:07:48 <[-_-]>	who uses zip ?
Mar 01 09:07:55 <[-_-]>	we live in zstd now
Mar 01 09:08:04 <makendo>	Windows people use zip
Mar 01 09:08:12 <B-|>	you're not representative of the population
Mar 01 09:08:18 <B-|>	far from it
Mar 01 09:08:30 <makendo>	Windows 11 gained support for .tar and derivatives though
Mar 01 09:08:45 <edu4rdshl>	zip is just a format, any tool can implement it
Mar 01 09:08:52 <makendo>	s/Windows 11/Windows 11 file explorer/
Mar 01 09:09:06 <B-|>	anyway, zip generates files that aren't compatible with miuishit nor windows
Mar 01 09:09:08 <edu4rdshl>	Zo, zip and unzip from the repos works just fine
Mar 01 09:09:17 <edu4rdshl>	B-|, they are
Mar 01 09:09:25 <B-|>	i literally tested it.....
Mar 01 09:09:31 <edu4rdshl>	And I use them day to day
Mar 01 09:09:33 <B-|>	doesn't handle unicode files right
Mar 01 09:09:37 <[-_-]>	B-|: you can make the symlink your self, in your ~/.local/bin folder
Mar 01 09:09:37 <B-|>	file names
Mar 01 09:09:44 <[-_-]>	add that to the path, and chill
Mar 01 09:09:49 <makendo>	zip filename encoding is a perennial issue
Mar 01 09:10:18 <B-|>	[-_-]: except packages in official repos depend on unzip and zip...
Mar 01 09:10:18 <[-_-]>	add it like this PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
Mar 01 09:10:19 <makendo>	Windows tend to use legacy encodings while Linux is predominantly UTF-8-only
Mar 01 09:11:16 <[-_-]>	B-|: you are not changing the system wide bin dir, so pacman run as root should not be affected
Mar 01 09:11:19 <B-|>	makendo: also i feel comfortable saying that windows 11 quirks are less universal than linux quirks...
Mar 01 09:11:19 <makendo>	try check "Beta: use UTF-8" on Windows and reboot and it can support zip files from Linux (noote: will break older zip archives with members of non-ASCII filenames)
Mar 01 09:11:28 <[-_-]>	althogh idk if sudo will be affected
Mar 01 09:12:08 <B-|>	should i take all this response that doesn't answer my question to mean a "no"
Mar 01 09:12:30 <B-|>	because that's all i need to forget about zip and switch to 7z
Mar 01 09:12:38 <B-|>	cli
Mar 01 09:12:48 <[-_-]>	I can't answer that, sorry
Mar 01 09:13:12 <edu4rdshl>	Also, isn't 7zip a windows-only thing?
Mar 01 09:13:20 <[-_-]>	p7zip
Mar 01 09:13:22 <makendo>	7-zip is available on Linux
Mar 01 09:13:23 <B-|>	look up p7zip
Mar 01 09:13:44 <B-|>	seems to be the sensible way to work with zip files
Mar 01 09:14:08 <edu4rdshl>	Well, then create the symlinks by yourself if that's what you're looking for
Mar 01 09:14:08 <[-_-]>	for extracting I use unar, but I don't make zips
Mar 01 09:14:54 <edu4rdshl>	I doubt that a package just for creating those symlinks will ever makes sense
Mar 01 09:15:10 <edu4rdshl>	Also, it will cause conflicts with other tools (zip, unzip)
Mar 01 09:15:21 <B-|>	edu4rdshl: i'm just mad i was using a dead project that doesn't even work right instead of 7z and wanted to never think about the problems of unzip again
Mar 01 09:16:05 <B-|>	getting dozens of people to accept the same file twice isn't that easy
Mar 01 09:16:44 <makendo>	quick way to avoid the filename encoding problem is to never name any of your files in anything other than just ASCII characters
Mar 01 09:16:51 <edu4rdshl>	B-|, well, then create a modified version of the package by yourself that does create the symlinks and add a conflicts with zip/unzip
Mar 01 09:16:56 <makendo>	that makes a universal ZIP file
Mar 01 09:16:58 <B-|>	makendo: should i also move to usa
Mar 01 09:17:15 <makendo>	nope
Mar 01 09:17:16 <B-|>	edu4rdshl: i might
Mar 01 09:17:51 <edu4rdshl>	Uh, you may also wants a provides=
Mar 01 09:17:51 <[-_-]>	or just make your own scrips, I almost never use any vanilla cli program, I use wrapper, mostly by me, or by others, who remembers options
Mar 01 09:18:01 <B-|>	i don't think utf8 and utf16 are compatible to that degree
Mar 01 09:18:06 <edu4rdshl>	gnome-shell actually requires unzip
Mar 01 09:18:21 <B-|>	do ascii names work on windows?
Mar 01 09:18:30 <[-_-]>	maybe
Mar 01 09:18:34 <makendo>	ascii names work everywhere
Mar 01 09:19:01 <makendo>	except on some z/OS mainframes but nobody here would touch one imo
Mar 01 09:21:06 <[-_-]>	B-|: is linux your first os ?
Mar 01 09:21:15 <B-|>	wym
Mar 01 09:21:22 <[-_-]>	I am just curious, I never met anyone who started with linux
Mar 01 09:21:23 <B-|>	only os i use?
Mar 01 09:21:27 <B-|>	ah no
Mar 01 09:21:33 <edu4rdshl>	I wonder how `bsdtar` handles your case, B-| 
Mar 01 09:21:35 <B-|>	i have windows braindamage
Mar 01 09:21:51 <B-|>	edu4rdshl: it works on zip files?
Mar 01 09:22:03 <edu4rdshl>	> This implementation can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm, 7-zip, and ISO 9660 cdrom images and can create tar, pax, cpio, ar, zip, 7-zip, and shar archives.
Mar 01 09:22:15 <B-|>	interesting
Mar 01 09:22:33 <[-_-]>	I think 7zip is better for your case, since you will be sending it to windows folks
Mar 01 09:22:45 <[-_-]>	or did I just assume something
Mar 01 09:23:40 <edu4rdshl>	Well, as mentioned before, it's just a format, anyone can implement it, and, theotherically all implementations should be compatible but that's certainly not the case
Mar 01 09:23:42 <B-|>	yes, actually i go by they/them
Mar 01 09:23:47 <B-|>	(joking)
Mar 01 09:24:19 <[-_-]>	also, if you are sending zip files, you can't assume any fancy features, this you will have to research, which features are supported by default on windows, also the version of windows, I would assume the other person uses xp, and then only use those features of zip that xp supports on its own
Mar 01 09:24:20 <B-|>	edu4rdshl: well the implementations that matter don't work with zip
Mar 01 09:24:35 <edu4rdshl>	Latest `zip` release was 2008, ewww
Mar 01 09:24:41 <B-|>	yes.................................
Mar 01 09:24:53 <B-|>	that's what i was annoyed by
Mar 01 09:24:55 <edu4rdshl>	https://libarchive.org/ (which provides bsdtar) is very well maintained
Mar 01 09:24:56 <phrik>	Title: libarchive - C library and command-line tools for reading and writing tar, cpio, zip, ISO, and other archive formats @ GitHub (at libarchive.org)
Mar 01 09:25:08 <[-_-]>	windows may not support lzma compressed zips
Mar 01 09:25:27 <makendo>	data in zip is best compressed with deflate
Mar 01 09:25:28 <[-_-]>	for example, good luck
Mar 01 09:25:41 <makendo>	any other format is not portable
Mar 01 09:32:08 <B-|>	bsdtar isn't intuitive
Mar 01 09:44:54 <[-_-]>	B-|: have you decided yet
Mar 01 09:47:43 <makendo>	documentation on p7zip usage is hell
Mar 01 09:48:05 <[-_-]>	yeah, but fancy features are not portable, so no need
Mar 01 09:48:14 <[-_-]>	:D
Mar 01 09:49:26 <makendo>	~~actually, if your language uses Latin script, dropping diacritics in filenames seem like a good compromise~~
Mar 01 09:49:41 <makendo>	(~~a~~: a, striked out)
Mar 01 11:28:47 <ecraven>	does anyone here know whether there's an IRC channel or discord or whatever for Tesseract the OCR engine?
Mar 01 11:41:44 <torv>	ecraven: Forums and MLs it seems. https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract?tab=readme-ov-file#support
Mar 01 11:43:46 <ecraven>	torv: thanks
Mar 01 12:18:20 <Blutkoete>	omg, my reboot-required build hook works, I might be the smartest person on this planet
Mar 01 12:18:24 <Blutkoete>	Emphasis on "might"
Mar 01 12:18:52 <Blutkoete>	*pacman hook
Mar 01 12:24:53 <Blutkoete>	pacman is imho just the best package manager, simple & powerful at the same time
Mar 01 13:26:02 <rav>	really?
Mar 01 13:59:56 <B-|>	i think the problem was gigantic paths...
Mar 01 14:00:02 <phonemic>	Where is the default gpg keyserver configured in arch?
Mar 01 14:00:20 <B-|>	ubuntu or smth

Mar 01 14:03:37 <Namarrgon>	unless you set one gnupg will fall back to the "hardcoded" default of keyserver.ubuntu.com
Mar 01 14:04:53 <ChaoticInstalls>	*read the rules* Installation issue: when trying to follow specifically this guide for installing Arch with Full disk encryption using LUKS, with Grub as bootloader ( https://gist.github.com/huntrar/e42aee630bee3295b2c671d098c81268 ) on a UEFI/GPT system with a protective MBR, after doing: arch-chroot the `lsblk -f`-cmd stops to display the filesystem-types of any partition as well as grub-install returns error: 
Mar 01 14:04:53 <ChaoticInstalls>	unknown filesystem
Mar 01 14:05:26 <Namarrgon>	ChaoticInstalls: you mean inside the chroot?
Mar 01 14:05:28 <phonemic>	Namarrgon: Thanks, where can I see that is the hardcoded default?
Mar 01 14:05:36 <Namarrgon>	phonemic: go through the sources
Mar 01 14:05:57 <Namarrgon>	maybe the manual lists it, i haven'T checked it
Mar 01 14:06:00 <phonemic>	The keyserver value in 'gpgconf --list-options gpg' is numbers
Mar 01 14:06:10 <phonemic>	Not a URL
Mar 01 14:06:29 <jelle>	ChaoticInstalls: what is protective MBR
Mar 01 14:06:58 <Namarrgon>	phonemic: start dirmngr and run "keyserver"
Mar 01 14:09:02 <ChaoticInstalls>	@jelle apparently non-relevant information since I used gdisk for partitioning (it is an MBR partition that should protect the GPT-partition table from tools like fdisk (back when they weren't able to do GPT-partitioning)
Mar 01 14:10:38 <phonemic>	Namarrgon: Thanks! I see it.
Mar 01 14:11:16 <ChaoticInstalls>	[ got the information from: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/backup-and-storage/guid-partitioning-table-disk-faq  ]
Mar 01 14:11:18 <phrik>	Title: FAQs about GUID Partitioning Table disk | Microsoft Learn (at learn.microsoft.com)
Mar 01 14:11:24 <Namarrgon>	ChaoticInstalls: lsblk relies on the udev cache, which isn't populated in the chroot. 'blkid' is usually a good enough substitute here.
Mar 01 14:14:09 <ChaoticInstalls>	@Namarrgon ah I see. I also read that Grub doesn't actually need the ESP or flag set since it uses the efibootmgr which I downloaded before, however I don't know how to debug the unknown filesystem response from grub-install command - I mostly found web-talk about people being thrown into grub-rescue post-installation (e.g. after updating some packages)
Mar 01 14:14:30 <Namarrgon>	you don't have to set any flags
Mar 01 14:14:40 <Namarrgon>	what is the grub-install command you run?
Mar 01 14:14:58 <jelle>	what is this 1MB partition even, are you attempting an encrypted /boot?
Mar 01 14:17:10 <ChaoticInstalls>	I tried: grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB   (after mounting /mnt  and creating /mnt/efi directory)
Mar 01 14:17:33 <Namarrgon>	did you mount the ESP to /mnt/efi before arch-chrooting into /mnt?
Mar 01 14:17:43 <ChaoticInstalls>	yes that as well
Mar 01 14:18:20 <jelle>	well uhhh https://gist.github.com/huntrar/e42aee630bee3295b2c671d098c81268?permalink_comment_id=4614941#gistcomment-4614941
Mar 01 14:19:00 <Namarrgon>	what is the output of "findmnt /mnt/efi" from outside the chroot?
Mar 01 14:19:21 <ChaoticInstalls>	oh wow, i am embarassed a shitload
Mar 01 14:19:27 <ChaoticInstalls>	and thank you very much
Mar 01 14:20:50 <jelle>	13:07:45  ChaoticInstalls | @jelle apparently non-relevant information since I used gdisk for partitioning (it is an MBR partition that should protect the GPT-partition table from tools like fdisk (back when they weren't able to do GPT-partitioning)
Mar 01 14:20:54 <jelle>	this seems very much bogus 
Mar 01 14:21:21 <Namarrgon>	it's not relevant
Mar 01 14:21:38 <Namarrgon>	gdisk and fdisk will create the pmbr either way without any user input
Mar 01 14:22:23 <jelle>	right feels like copy pasted cargo cult :-)
Mar 01 14:23:04 <Namarrgon>	the guide author was paid per character!
Mar 01 14:23:27 <ChaoticInstalls>	oh ok Namarrgon, so i only need to create the ~600MB EFI and a Linux Luks partition (sized the rest of the disk)?
Mar 01 14:23:54 <ChaoticInstalls>	but in that comment link I don't really understand what helped, using the tun2fs tool?
Mar 01 14:24:18 <ChaoticInstalls>	tune2fs *
Mar 01 14:25:24 <ChaoticInstalls>	oh yes apparently, the metadata checksum is wrong
Mar 01 14:28:51 <Namarrgon>	are you going to set up secureboot too?
Mar 01 14:30:13 <ChaoticInstalls>	and I have one more question - before I can unplug this machine and retry the installation on the other: after doing pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware ... I get severall messages (warnings) about modules which aren't installed /set up correctly - i cannot recall their name atm - how to do that?
Mar 01 14:30:22 <ChaoticInstalls>	@Namarrgon, yes I wanted to
Mar 01 14:30:49 <Namarrgon>	then you should have kept the kernel on the ESP and not bothered with grub
Mar 01 14:31:15 <Namarrgon>	it would have been less complicated and there would be no need to disable all the shiny features
Mar 01 14:31:52 <Namarrgon>	you can ignore the missing-firmware warnings if they don't belong to hardware you need in the initramfs
Mar 01 14:32:17 <ChaoticInstalls>	how would I do that instead - i.e. using which bootloader then?
Mar 01 14:35:29 <ChaoticInstalls>	I mean, would I use syslinux or systemd-boot?
Mar 01 14:35:32 <Namarrgon>	e.g. systemd-boot
Mar 01 14:37:03 <Namarrgon>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_kernel_image
Mar 01 14:37:04 <phrik>	Title: Unified kernel image - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Mar 01 14:37:14 <Namarrgon>	once you have that working the rest is simple
Mar 01 14:37:27 <Namarrgon>	but now, lunch break!
Mar 01 14:38:05 <ChaoticInstalls>	great! thanks a lot
