Dec 10 10:43:14 <ravage>	a filesystem check is not a full surface test (which only makes sense on spinning rust, if at all). so even regular filesystem checks dont reduce the lifespan

Dec 10 11:43:04 <ice9>	what does cloud-init do?

Dec 10 11:43:46 <ikonia>	oops
Dec 10 11:43:57 <ikonia>	ice9: cloud init is for provisioning/config at launch time
Dec 10 11:44:07 <ikonia>	it's probably not 'needed' but a dependency of one of the packages
Dec 10 11:44:16 <ikonia>	as packages often have more than one use
Dec 10 11:45:03 <ice9>	ikonia, as I read about it, it's needed for ubuntu cloud images and for live systems when they boot; so why I can't file a bug if it's systemd unit is not running?
Dec 10 11:45:44 <ikonia>	ice9: as I said, it's used for provisioning configuration, it's possible it's used for config capture when reporting a bug or something along those lines
Dec 10 11:45:57 <ikonia>	it's not just for cloud images or live systems,

I've checked out the ubuntu/jammy branch of valgrind and want to make some changes to the valgrind code itself (not just the packaging). I'm running tests in a Docker container so the easiest way to move things around is as a .deb
Dec 11 18:14:32 <garrettkajmowicz>	package.

Dec 11 18:16:35 <leftyfb>	vadique: you can't remap the windows key using xmodmap
Dec 11 18:16:52 <leftyfb>	you can only specify what program/action runs when you press it
Dec 11 18:17:00 <leftyfb>	in the keyboard shortcuts settings
Dec 11 18:19:13 <younder>	OK I am one of those idiots that redefine global key-maps so they better fit Emacs. I use Tweak Tools
Dec 11 18:19:54 <leftyfb>	younder: you can't remap the Windows key
Dec 11 18:20:20 <leftyfb>	wait, I might be thinking of the function key
Dec 11 18:20:51 <younder>	Nor should you. It is too essential.. Settle for Alt+Space and the like
Dec 11 18:21:15 <leftyfb>	yeah, but vadique doesn't see to car about functionality and just wants it gone
Dec 11 18:21:35 <leftyfb>	vadique: https://askubuntu.com/questions/137172/how-to-remap-super-left-key-to-control-key
Dec 11 18:21:38 <vadique>	xmodmap -e "remove mod4 = Super_L"
Dec 11 18:21:57 <vadique>	now it gives --> mod4        Meta_L (0x85),  Meta_R (0x86),  Meta_L (0xcd)
Dec 11 18:22:19 <vadique>	leftyfb, I found that article before you did :)
Dec 11 18:22:53 <vadique>	but after that, just touching windoze & L logs me out
Dec 11 18:23:11 <leftyfb>	don't touch super+L
Dec 11 18:23:44 <vadique>	I switched superization off
Dec 11 18:24:48 <vadique>	I just want all meta+L meta+Q meta+N meta+themall to never do anything other than just meta+something
Dec 11 18:24:52 <leftyfb>	vadique: set a shortcut for something else for super+L
Dec 11 18:25:01 <leftyfb>	why?
Dec 11 18:26:48 <vadique>	leftyfb, how to quickly disable all these shortcuts?
Dec 11 18:27:10 <leftyfb>	vadique: why do you need to disable all the shortcuts?
Dec 11 18:27:45 <vadique>	leftyfb, all related to that key at least, print for capturing the screen is okay
Dec 11 18:27:51 <leftyfb>	why?
Dec 11 18:29:09 <vadique>	leftyfb, because I'm emulating Mac OS 9 (it's 1997 yeah) in Qemu and it sends Meta as Command key to the guest (emulated) machine, and I can't use Mac OS 9 without the command (apple) key
Dec 11 18:30:05 <vadique>	thus I want to leave meta+N (new), meta+S (save), meta+Q (quit), et cetera
Dec 11 18:32:36 <ash_worksi>	if a network is unavailable and `apt install ...` attempts to fetch a package, does that mean it cannot be installed from cache?
Dec 11 18:32:56 <younder>	vadique is there any chance of persuading you to let the Windows key be?
Dec 11 18:33:25 <leftyfb>	ash_worksi: it should be able to install from the cache. Or you can just use dpkg on those cached files
Dec 11 18:33:26 <ravage>	ash_worksi: it means it is not cached
Dec 11 18:34:16 <vadique>	phew https://ibb.co/SPpwrkT
Dec 11 18:35:08 <younder>	vadique after all noone uses the space-kadet keyboard anymore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard
Dec 11 18:36:43 <vadique>	well, disabling all in "system" and "windows" was enough
Dec 11 18:39:01 <younder>	Ritchard Stallman wrote it on lisp machine in 1984 a very long time ago. The world has moved on.
Dec 11 18:39:28 <leftyfb>	younder: wrong channel?
Dec 11 18:42:11 <ash_worksi>	leftyfb: just for my information, is `dpkg -i network-manager` yeilding error "file not found" further evidence the package is not in cache?
Dec 11 18:42:34 <ash_worksi>	(even though I saw your comment, ravage :))
Dec 11 18:42:37 <leftyfb>	ash_worksi: that's because there's no cached file called "network-manager"
Dec 11 18:42:38 <younder>	apparently Emacs is also GNU
Dec 11 18:46:45 <vadique>	command+Q still doesn't work ... where it can be disabled
Dec 11 18:47:08 <vadique>	I mean, capturing it by something between me and qemu
Dec 11 18:50:14 <ash_worksi>	leftyfb: so "Yes"
Dec 11 19:20:13 <vadique>	I switchd off almost anything in navigation, but meta+Q is captured anyway
Dec 11 19:21:12 <vadique>	mmm? https://askubuntu.com/questions/977876/changing-command-super-q
Dec 11 19:21:57 <vadique>	yeah, "gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock hot-keys false" works
Dec 11 19:22:38 <vadique>	and finally, now I can use qemu, again
Dec 11 19:22:54 <vadique>	weeeeeeeehaaaw
Dec 11 20:05:10 <dreamcat4>	hi! i am looking for the location of the alsa config file?

Dec 17 12:57:35 <bm>	Kinda weird question, but are there "hidden" keyboard shortcuts in Ubuntu?
Dec 17 12:57:38 <bm>	For example, when I press Super+D, all my windows disappear, but there is nothing assigned to that combination in Settings. The shortcut for hiding windows isn't Super+D, it's Ctrl+Super+D.
Dec 17 12:57:44 <bm>	What exactly is responsible for that? It must be a Ubuntu-specific thing, because nothing like that happens in GNOME Debian.
Dec 17 13:05:06 <Paris>	maybe your window manager
Dec 17 13:05:25 <Paris>	on top of the desktop, like openbox shortcut versus....underlying qt stuff
Dec 17 13:05:49 <Paris>	oh you're using the desfault Ubuntu  desktop env maybe.
Dec 17 13:17:13 <hleneto>	bm, maybe see GNOME keyboard settings and see gnome-tweaks .
Dec 17 13:21:12 <bm>	don't see anything that would catch my eye there

janv. 18 07:40:12 <lunatiq>	I have no idea what you're asking me
janv. 18 07:40:20 <lunatiq>	"what did I boot up" it's a server
janv. 18 07:40:34 <lunatiq>	It's 22.04 LTS and using SSH cli
janv. 18 07:40:48 <lunatiq>	it has a hdd but says it mounted when I try to mount it
janv. 18 07:41:00 <lunatiq>	I check the df -h and it is not listed

janv. 18 07:42:38 <lunatiq>	no
janv. 18 07:43:29 <ravage>	so you have a blank HDD probably
janv. 18 07:43:45 <ravage>	send the output of: fdisk -l /dev/sda | nc termbin.com 9999
janv. 18 07:45:02 <ravage>	(that assumes you are root)

janv. 18 08:01:54 <lunatiq>	Sorry it took so long
janv. 18 08:02:59 <ravage>	that drive is or was part of a raid
janv. 18 08:03:27 <ravage>	so what do you expect to be on there?
janv. 18 08:03:56 <lunatiq>	I'm installing a panel and it doesn't have this drive available
janv. 18 08:04:29 <ravage>	so you do not need the existing data on that drive?
janv. 18 08:05:50 <lunatiq>	No
janv. 18 08:06:30 <ravage>	if you are sure that is correct you should wipe that drive first
janv. 18 08:07:03 <ravage>	then. and only then you use: wipefs -a /dev/sda
janv. 18 08:07:15 <ravage>	and then follow https://techguides.yt/guides/how-to-partition-format-and-auto-mount-disk-on-ubuntu-20-04/
janv. 18 08:08:03 <ravage>	also if that is a server you rent and they provided you with this drive you should find a new privider
janv. 18 08:08:20 <ravage>	they probably gave you a drive with existing old customer data
janv. 18 08:10:47 <ravage>	really make sure that this drive is not already part of any raid that is active on your system
janv. 18 08:11:17 <lunatiq>	ravage its a fresh hetzner server
janv. 18 08:11:30 <lunatiq>	I'm installing a app and it doesn't list the hdd as available
janv. 18 08:11:34 <lunatiq>	it only lists the nvme
janv. 18 08:11:37 <lunatiq>	that's raid
janv. 18 08:12:48 <ravage>	can you send the output of: fdisk -l | nc termbin.com 9999
janv. 18 08:12:58 <ravage>	and: mount | nc termbin.com 9999
janv. 18 08:13:43 <ravage>	also: cat /prod/mdstat | nc termbin.com 9999
janv. 18 08:19:10 <ravage>	Sorry last one is proc

janv. 18 08:56:02 <Bluewolf>	<lotuspsychje> Good day. So, I tried a previous kernel and it boots up without an issue. 6.3.14 is the problem one, I loaded into 6.3.39 I think. But as a side note, I've noticed my windows partition get slow when its booting. It may be a separate issue or connected?
janv. 18 08:58:00 <Bluewolf>	Sorry, its: Linux version 6.5.0-14-generic which is the problematic one.
janv. 18 09:19:17 <Kartagis>	I have a problem. I have installed Ubuntu desktop in UTM on Mac. However, the grub menu stayed the same. How can I at least boot to a specific option?

janv. 18 10:55:36 <OnkelTem>	Hi all. Is ufw a thing? Can I use it or it's too buggy?
janv. 18 10:56:02 <OnkelTem>	I don't know what's wrong with it, but right after installation, w/o any config, it fails all the time
janv. 18 10:56:19 <OnkelTem>	I just needed to add a simple NAT rule, but nah... No way
janv. 18 10:56:42 <Habbie>	i liked ufw until i wanted NAT; it's just not made for that
janv. 18 10:57:39 <Habbie>	random search engine hit - it's not a -big- hack to add it https://gist.github.com/kimus/9315140
janv. 18 11:00:40 <OnkelTem>	Habbie: w/o any rules it doesn't work on almost fresh system, that's the thing
janv. 18 11:00:48 <OnkelTem>	I mean, with the default set of rules
janv. 18 11:00:55 <Habbie>	"doesn't work"?
janv. 18 11:01:10 <OnkelTem>	so I install it, then run `sudo ufw enable` and get this:
janv. 18 11:01:43 <OnkelTem>	damn, let me restart

janv. 18 11:22:24 <rs2009>	hey y'all, I've been trying to get Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.10 working without any graphical issues on a 14900H with Iris Xe graphics (a7a0); there appears to be a "grid" of continuously flickering "box"es (whenever there's a new frame rendered, that is if there's any movement on the screen) on GNOME with Wayland, while on X11 there are boxes
janv. 18 11:22:24 <rs2009>	exhibiting.
janv. 18 11:22:31 <rs2009>	the same behavior passing through the center of the screen (not a grid per se, just a line of boxes through the center)
janv. 18 11:25:35 <rs2009>	I've tried several boot parameters (i915.enable_psr=0, i915.enable_fbc=0, intel_idle.max_cstate=4), and even tried a custom-compiled kernel with the new Xe drivers (which just panics with this particular iGPU for some reason) with absolutely no luck; this doesn't happen if I disable i915 with nomodeset of course, so I was wondering if anyone's
janv. 18 11:25:35 <rs2009>	faced anything similar with Iris Xe graphics and if there's any way to get it working I'm unaware of
janv. 18 11:30:00 <fweht>	i seem to have conflicting node installs, i installed node 20 from snap and node 18 with apt, can i savely remove node via apt and all dependencies?  will the node from snap automatically appear in my path?
janv. 18 11:33:02 <ravage>	Snap is in your path on a default installation 
janv. 18 11:33:58 <ravage>	Usually even before your other paths
janv. 18 11:35:32 <fweht>	ravage: ok cool, so ill delete the rest
janv. 18 11:39:15 <Kartagis>	Firefox keeps crashing on me. Why is that?
janv. 18 11:39:58 <Kartagis>	this is really annoying
janv. 18 11:40:34 <Kartagis>	this gets really annoying after 4-5 times*
janv. 18 11:41:13 <Kartagis>	and it keeps happening when I try syncing
janv. 18 11:52:28 <tomreyn>	Kartagis: do you have some more information? whch ubuntu release are you running ( lsb_release -ds ), is your system all updated? are you using the snap or a different firefox installation?
janv. 18 11:52:41 <tomreyn>	which firefox version is this?
janv. 18 11:54:02 <tomreyn>	does it also happen when you run firefox in troubleshoot mode? https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/diagnose-firefox-issues-using-troubleshoot-mode
janv. 18 11:56:05 <tomreyn>	when you run firefox normally, but start it from a terminal (emulator) window, does it print anything by the time it is crashing?
janv. 18 11:56:45 <Kartagis>	tomreyn: 22.04.3. yes it's updated. I don't know if it's snap or something else. I can't tell you the version because it crashed as soon as I ran it.
janv. 18 11:57:36 <tomreyn>	Kartagis: what does    readlink -f $(which firefox)    return?
janv. 18 11:58:16 <Kartagis>	tomreyn: a question though. does it matter if I have installed ubuntu in an emulator on a Mac with Apple Silicon chip?
janv. 18 11:59:24 <tomreyn>	it could matter in that you may be running the non-default (amd64) architecture, and in that the ubuntu installation might be customized
janv. 18 11:59:36 <tomreyn>	how did you install ubuntu there?
janv. 18 12:00:39 <Kartagis>	tomreyn: I fired up UTM and installed Ubuntu.
janv. 18 12:01:05 <tomreyn>	UTM is?
janv. 18 12:01:23 <tomreyn>	ah, some virtualization software for mac
janv. 18 12:01:44 <Kartagis>	tomreyn: readlink says /usr/bin/firefox
janv. 18 12:01:58 <tomreyn>	and you installe dubuntu by downloading it's .ISO file from ubuntu.com ?
janv. 18 12:02:45 <Kartagis>	tomreyn: that's right
janv. 18 12:03:06 <tomreyn>	okay, so that's a proper installation, cool.
janv. 18 12:03:42 <tomreyn>	firefox -v    says what?
janv. 18 12:06:16 <Kartagis>	tomreyn: firefox exited again the terminal said exiting due to a channel error
janv. 18 12:06:50 <Kartagis>	firefox -v says 116.0.2
janv. 18 12:07:11 <Kartagis>	is that only old or way old?
janv. 18 12:07:24 <ravage>	too old for sure
janv. 18 12:08:07 <ravage>	make sure firefox is closed and run: sudo snap refresh firefox
janv. 18 12:08:11 <tomreyn>	maybe that's esr? but i don't think ubuntu provides that
janv. 18 12:09:18 <dawnbreaker>	ubuntu server arm iso maybe does
janv. 18 12:09:36 <dawnbreaker>	i was watching a utm youtube
janv. 18 12:10:52 <ravage>	Kartagis: what is the output of: uname -a
janv. 18 12:10:56 <Kartagis>	maybe I should install server and GUI on top of that. because I need GUI
janv. 18 12:11:37 <dawnbreaker>	falkon is a good web browser too
janv. 18 12:11:54 <Kartagis>	Linux tolgaozses 6.5.0-14-generic #14~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Nov 20 18:15:30 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
janv. 18 12:12:08 <ravage>	ok so this is a normal x64 install
janv. 18 12:12:10 <Kartagis>	oh look, clipboard works
janv. 18 12:12:10 <tomreyn>	22.04 arm64 defaults to the snap as well, and it provides the same version as amd64
janv. 18 12:12:31 <ravage>	snap should give you the latest stable version
janv. 18 12:13:09 <tomreyn>	it would be better idea to install the ubuntu arm64 architecture build on this device, though
janv. 18 12:13:10 <ravage>	that is 121 right now
janv. 18 12:13:23 <Kartagis>	tomreyn: I need amd64, I have a piece of docker software which platform dependent.
janv. 18 12:13:25 <tomreyn>	yes snap 121 is stable
janv. 18 12:13:55 <tomreyn>	there is esr/stable (116.6esd-1), too
janv. 18 12:14:08 <tomreyn>	there is esr/stable (115.6.0esr-1), too
janv. 18 12:14:15 <tomreyn>	sorry, i'm fat fingered
janv. 18 12:14:22 <ravage>	but then he installed that version manually at some point
janv. 18 12:14:45 <ravage>	and yes that would be 115 not 116
janv. 18 12:14:59 <tomreyn>	i think the esr snap would report that it is "esr" on -v
janv. 18 12:15:13 <tomreyn>	so, ye,s looks like a mnual, outdated, firefox installation
janv. 18 12:15:57 <Kartagis>	...and firefox crashed again
janv. 18 12:16:28 <tomreyn>	Kartagis: so what does   snap list firefox    and    apt list --installed firefox   say?
janv. 18 12:17:08 <Kartagis>	tomreyn: if you're asking if it's a snap, yes snap list listed firefox
janv. 18 12:17:16 <tomreyn>	and what happens when you   sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -V    ? pleasde show the full output on a pastebin, we suggest https://dpaste.com
janv. 18 12:20:28 <Kartagis>	upgrading now
janv. 18 12:21:13 <tomreyn>	hope this fixes it - i got to leave for now. good luck!
janv. 18 12:22:23 <Kartagis>	thanks a lot
janv. 18 12:27:20 <tomreyn>	you're welcome - if you run into more / related issues, just ask again
janv. 18 12:27:25 <Kartagis>	wee, it didn't crash now.
janv. 18 12:27:43 <Kartagis>	it is syncing
janv. 18 12:29:16 <tomreyn>	running outdated software is dangerous, try to make sure that updates will happen automatically or you have a weekly schedule + reminder to install updates manually
janv. 18 12:30:07 <Kartagis>	will do that
janv. 18 12:34:37 <dawnbreaker>	tell us if it works
janv. 18 12:44:18 <Kartagis>	for some fricking reason, it just started crashing again. I have no other way but to install chrome and import my bookmarks
janv. 18 12:45:15 <Kartagis>	it being firefox
janv. 18 12:45:52 <Kartagis>	if not ff itself, the tab crashes
janv. 18 12:49:11 <dawnbreaker>	how much ram do you have..maybe idk
janv. 18 12:51:17 <Kartagis>	dawnbreaker: I allocated 4gb
janv. 18 12:55:21 <dawnbreaker>	kinda small amount but idk how much you need
janv. 18 12:56:23 <dawnbreaker>	you can run firefox from a terminal and see if theres errors when it crashes
janv. 18 12:58:07 <dawnbreaker>	oh wait that doesnt work
janv. 18 12:58:13 <dawnbreaker>	it escapes
janv. 18 13:00:21 <Kartagis>	dabbill: the terminal says "exiting due to a channel error"
janv. 18 13:01:40 <Kartagis>	dawnbreaker: the terminal says "exiting due to a channel error"
janv. 18 13:02:05 <Kartagis>	dawnbreaker: I probably need more than 4gb because GUI
janv. 18 13:02:56 <dawnbreaker>	maybe snap refresh
janv. 18 13:03:10 <dawnbreaker>	google channels for snap

févr. 12 13:07:13 <CosmicDJ>	John2005: do you have a remote log host? i.e. is syslog sending your logs somewhere safe?
févr. 12 13:07:30 <John2005>	no :o
févr. 12 13:07:38 <John2005>	Did not know you can do that :S
févr. 12 13:08:09 <John2005>	I can access the logs now but I see where you're going with this, its possible they've been altered to cover up things
févr. 12 13:08:42 <John2005>	What sorta things would I be looking for in that log?
févr. 12 13:11:26 <CosmicDJ>	John2005: logins, maybe exceptions/errors/crashdumps from internet-facing applications, firewall changes, etc.; but editing/removing logfiles is easy once you're in...
févr. 12 13:12:03 <CosmicDJ>	check https://attack.mitre.org for a list
févr. 12 13:16:00 <John2005>	do you have any recommendations on things like anti virus kind of programs that could scan to see if it finds any malicous things?
févr. 12 13:18:56 <ravage>	you can run rkhunter from time to time
févr. 12 13:19:17 <ravage>	i would not recommend running any anti virus on demand scanning
févr. 12 13:19:24 <ravage>	unless required by some policy
févr. 12 13:21:44 <Bugies>	John2005, ESET Endpoint Antivirus dla Linux ?
févr. 12 13:24:08 <John2005>	CosmicDJ: auth.log shows nothing unusual around the time of the port scan, same with syslog. the syslog shows crontabs and so on running every 1 minute and the same things that ran were the same things logged consistently throughout the day so nothing odd here too but again they could of covered this up I guess.
févr. 12 13:24:29 <John2005>	is it possible they could of triggered this portscan without gaining full access?
févr. 12 13:25:32 <John2005>	ravage: thank you, I was thinking of running an anti virus now to scan for anythign malicious and once its found it, I'd be better equipt to stop it after I reinstall OS but I wasn't intending to keep it going 24/7 kind of thing unless it didnt impact too much
févr. 12 13:26:35 <John2005>	<Bugies: Looks like thats a paid software, I'm not looking to spend $$$ at the moment if it can be helped
févr. 12 13:27:53 <CosmicDJ>	John2005: what else is running in your server?
févr. 12 13:28:44 <Bugies>	 ESET Endpoint Antivirus   has a virus database after installation, but it does not download updates without a license
févr. 12 13:30:35 <lotuspsychj3>	!info lynis | John2005 a nice scan for your system/server
févr. 12 13:30:37 <ubottu>	John2005 a nice scan for your system/server: lynis (3.0.8-1.1, mantic): security auditing tool for Unix based systems. In component universe, is optional. Built by lynis. Size 222 kB / 1,617 kB
févr. 12 13:32:39 <Bugies>	also blocks known windows Trojans from running
févr. 12 13:44:13 <John2005>	CosmicDJ: I run a few things, like game servers and a web server apache2  etc
févr. 12 13:47:56 <John2005>	Bugies: thank you so if I install it and run it, it will have the most reecnt database/uppdate but it wont let me update
févr. 12 13:48:55 <John2005>	lotuspsychj3: thanks I will try this too, if I can get as many scanners scanning, (one by one that is. not at all once lol) then something must be picked up surely
févr. 12 13:49:34 <Bugies>	yes it has some virus database John2005

févr. 12 14:01:08 -ChanServ-	[#ubuntu] Welcome to #ubuntu. This channel is logged. Use of this channel implies acceptance of terms at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/TermsOfService
févr. 12 14:35:25 <ToTheInternet>	I want to set a screen resolution as soon as X starts. Right now it is automatically set to the highest resolution, which i don't like. I'm using Ubuntu Studio with xmonad window manager (if it matters). I put my "xrandr" command into /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc but that doesn't seem to do anything. In fact, it isn't run at all because i also put in "echo $(date) > /home/myuser/startup.log" and the file wasn't written. How can i
févr. 12 14:35:25 <ToTheInternet>	set the resolution?
févr. 12 14:35:50 <ToTheInternet>	i was hoping to avoid xorg.conf because it's not 2005 anymore
févr. 12 14:44:49 <John2005>	So I ran the various scans and evertyhign comes back clean. I went back to the original report from the host for any clues... the "outgoing port" they mentioned. I checked this, it relates to a game server (Killing floor 2 server). I wonder if this game server is actually doing something "normal" but is being picked up by the host as a "port scan"....
févr. 12 14:45:44 <John2005>	Not sure exactly how to block "outgoing UDP" traffic on a specific outbound port if players joining that server need UDP protocal hmm
févr. 12 14:52:05 <weedmic>	John2005: you can use either "firewall" or iptables (which are now called nftables
févr. 12 15:03:16 <John2005>	weedmic, it will let you block port scanning outbound wise? hmm i will have to research,t hank you :)
févr. 12 15:05:10 <weedmic>	i generally block all and then open the ports for the type of traffic I wish to allow with nftables - there is a man page, but you can get examples off the web.  some computers only have like 3 lines of nftables.  i never got used to the graphical one.
févr. 12 15:10:50 <John2005>	weedmic: ahhh yeah that sounds like the most secure way of doing it, block by default. I'll end up blocking myself out no doutb though lol
févr. 12 15:13:16 <ogra_>	well, by default ubuntu does not open any ports to the outside world, ports only get opened by packages you install, since only root can install packages normal users can usually not open any ports
févr. 12 15:13:20 <ogra_>	if i were you i'd rather remove whatever package the user installed to actually get that gameserver running
févr. 12 15:13:32 <ogra_>	(and take away their sudo privs)
févr. 12 15:15:00 <ogra_>	a port blocker (it isnt really a "firewall", thats rather a physical device splitting two networks, but microsoft kind of marketed into being a thing on desktop computers 😛 ) will just cure the symptoms after all
févr. 12 15:15:46 <tykling>	[citation needed]
févr. 12 15:21:08 <ogra_>	tykling, just install windows XP ... before it had "firewall" in its system settings, the term was clearly defined as a network device hanging in your datacenter, splitting your network from the internet (or from another network, or building a DMZ with two firewall devices)
févr. 12 15:23:23 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
févr. 12 15:25:39 <tykling>	ogra_: what absolute nonsense, software firewalls existed before windows xp and what a weird thing to be gatekeeping about, just stop it lol
févr. 12 15:26:33 <ogra_>	tykling, dunno, in my times working in datacenters these things were called port blockers until XP showed up and MS marketed them as firewalls
févr. 12 15:26:58 <ogra_>	it was a noticeable change and a running gag between DC admins back then
févr. 12 15:28:04 <ogra_>	but as you like ... doesnt fit here anyway (bettwer for #ubuntu-discuss) and wont contribute to fixing the problem ... (though i wont stop calling them port blockers, sorry ...)

Feb 20 15:39:02 <Guest87>	trying to get x11vnc working, and keep getting XOpenDisplay(":0") failed where can I start looking for the issue?
Feb 20 15:39:30 <leftyfb>	Guest87: what release of ubuntu?
Feb 20 15:39:51 <oerheks>	and what session, wayland or Xorg?
Feb 20 15:39:51 <Guest87>	22.04.03 LTS
Feb 20 15:39:59 <Guest87>	Xorg should be
Feb 20 15:40:04 <leftyfb>	Guest87: echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
Feb 20 15:40:25 <Guest87>	tty right now as I am ssh'd in
Feb 20 15:40:41 <leftyfb>	there's your problem
Feb 20 15:40:50 <leftyfb>	export DISPLAY=:0 ; echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
Feb 20 15:41:21 <Guest87>	still tty
Feb 20 15:42:14 <leftyfb>	Guest87: is there a desktop running?
Feb 20 15:42:26 <Guest87>	service gdm3 is up and running
Feb 20 15:42:59 <Guest87>	is that enough?
Feb 20 15:43:18 <leftyfb>	Guest87: what type of machine is this?
Feb 20 15:43:27 <Guest87>	Ubuntu server
Feb 20 15:43:37 <leftyfb>	running on......
Feb 20 15:43:51 <leftyfb>	why do you need x11vnc on a server?
Feb 20 15:43:57 <Guest87>	x86_64
Feb 20 15:44:08 <leftyfb>	:/
Feb 20 15:44:14 <Guest87>	want to connect directly to the desktop
Feb 20 15:44:28 <leftyfb>	ubuntu server doesn't have a desktop by default
Feb 20 15:45:12 <Guest87>	this was working, but something is borked, ubuntu-desktop is installed, and like I said this was directly connecting fine
Feb 20 15:47:09 <Guest87>	is the $XDG_SESSION_TYPE supposed to point to xorg?
Feb 20 15:49:25 <oerheks>	yes, as you claim you run xorg
Feb 20 15:54:22 <Guest87>	So does xorg need to be running in order for this to work?
Feb 20 15:54:32 <Guest87>	sorry I dont understand the GUI very well
Feb 20 15:54:57 <raffo>	Guest87: where you exporting a running :0 desktop session before or the login manager screen?
Feb 20 15:55:47 <CosmicDJ>	Guest87: what do you try to do exactly? run X11 programs on your server? viah ssh X11 forwarding or VNC?
Feb 20 15:55:55 <CosmicDJ>	-h
Feb 20 15:57:29 <Guest87>	I just want to connect to the Ubuntu desktop
Feb 20 15:58:08 <Guest87>	this is what I was told to run and it worked up until a few days ago
Feb 20 15:58:09 <Guest87>	sudo -u gdm x11vnc -auth /run/user/128/gdm/Xauthority -display :0 -xkb -forever -rfbport 20000
Feb 20 15:58:38 <Guest87>	then I would VNC in to port 20000 and got connected to my desktop
Feb 20 15:59:31 <Guest87>	which now results in "XOpenDisplay(":0") failed."
Feb 20 16:00:34 <raffo>	is the server's local firewall set up to allow connections to that port?
Feb 20 16:01:44 <CosmicDJ>	Guest87: you want to connect to your Ubuntu Desktop from your server?
Feb 20 16:03:30 <Guest87>	From a Windows 10 machine, using VNCviewer
Feb 20 16:21:15 <spookyusers>	anyone have a good resource for running ubuntu (or linux in general) on mac? I wrecked my mac os and just decided to run ubuntu instead. It's going ok but few hiccups like when i close the macbook it just freezes and sound doesn't work.
Feb 20 16:38:32 <Haris_>	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50652808/apache-shutdown-couldnt-grab-mutex
Feb 20 16:38:40 <Haris_>	for my error ===> By one wonder or another, it seems that once your start using SSL certificates, this configuration line is somehow "ignored". Thus, Apache fail to find the lock dir for the mutex file.  \r\n   Just adding (remove comment) this line into /etc/apache2/apache2.conf isn't working either.
Feb 20 16:38:40 <Haris_>	You have to specifically create a configuration file and enable it. Else it won't solve the problem. <== is this also it?

Feb 20 16:40:03 <raffo>	Guest87: is there an actual session running at the time you're executing your x11vnc command?
Feb 20 16:40:20 <Haris_>	not sure if any of the server side guys are up-n-about
Feb 20 16:40:41 <Haris_>	they'r pretty peaceful since a while
Feb 20 16:41:02 <lotuspsychje>	Haris_: best to ask your question in one channel at once, unless volunteers advice specific channels
Feb 20 16:41:55 <Haris_>	noted
Feb 20 16:41:58 <lotuspsychje>	also for your question, try to use a !paste too
Feb 20 16:42:28 <Haris_>	its actually covered in the stackoverslow page. I was surprised about the last tid bit. Had to ask

Feb 20 16:47:59 <varaindemian>	Trying to install Grafana - https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/debian/

Feb 20 16:50:44 <leftyfb>	though it looks like step2 of their instructions should have worked for you

Feb 20 16:50:55 <varaindemian>	leftyfb: issued your command and I get the same error at `apt update`
Feb 20 16:51:03 <leftyfb>	ok, just use the snap then

Feb 20 16:51:57 <leftyfb>	varaindemian: or contact grafana for support with their repository

Feb 20 16:58:07 <ApostleInTriumph>	Hi All. I'm a root of a server and somehow it got restarted abruptly. I want to understand who/what triggered the restart. How do I find it out?
Feb 20 17:03:07 <oerheks>	Check last reboot and /var/log/syslog ?
Feb 20 17:08:09 <ApostleInTriumph>	Inside that, how do I check who restarted or was it an automatic one?
Feb 20 17:32:00 <tuxick>	normally only root can do that
Feb 20 17:32:14 <ApostleInTriumph>	yes, I'm a root
Feb 20 17:33:26 <raffo>	check the log and see if another user became root or logged in as root right before the reboot.
Feb 20 17:34:46 <ApostleInTriumph>	how do I check which user became root?
Feb 20 17:37:10 <raffo>	journalctl -n100
Feb 20 17:37:48 <raffo>	no, you need to dump the log around the time the reboot occurred.
Feb 20 17:38:20 <raffo>	man journactl
Feb 20 17:38:57 <raffo>	e.g. journalctl -n5000 | grep "Feb 19", or something like that.
Feb 20 17:39:26 <raffo>	there are other ways to dump particular intervals.
Feb 20 17:40:09 <raffo>	This is assuming your system logs are persistent. In some configurations the system logs are discarded after a reboot.
Feb 20 17:43:16 <raffo>	Check /var/log/messages too, if you have it.
Feb 20 18:48:29 <Guest8919>	where is the openvpn client config file created by Gnome/Network Manager stored?
Feb 20 18:52:26 <oerheks>	i bet you did not do any research? /etc/openvpn/client.conf

Feb 20 22:31:58 <mrcoffee>	Hello
Feb 20 22:32:06 <mrcoffee>	My computer is not shutting down with ubuntu
Feb 20 22:32:16 <mrcoffee>	I have tried editing grub
Feb 20 22:32:22 <mrcoffee>	BUt still not shutting down.
Feb 20 22:32:37 <mrcoffee>	It will shut down once if i do a dpkg on boot..
Feb 20 22:32:53 <mrcoffee>	But the second time wont shut down anymore..
Feb 20 22:33:29 <mrcoffee>	On shut down it says something about filesystem being remounted read only -ro and then it says powering off but never fully does.
Feb 20 22:41:15 <preach>	wat
Feb 20 22:41:33 <preach>	none of that made any sense..
Feb 20 22:42:54 <oerheks>	run a fsck on that partition(s)
Feb 20 22:43:58 <oerheks>	https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/disk-repair.html.en //https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilesystemTroubleshooting
Feb 20 23:06:20 <plastikman>	i guess i was too late for mrcoffee but what a strange thing to ask.  that is not a grub issue but an acpi issue
Feb 20 23:11:19 <mrcoffee>	Hi there
Feb 20 23:11:27 <mrcoffee>	Still having shutdown issues, any ideas?
Feb 20 23:13:10 <leftyfb>	mrcoffee: if your filesystem is being mounted read-only it's typically due to a corrupt filesystem and/or bad storage device
Feb 20 23:15:25 <mrcoffee>	Ok.. Thats what i see on shutdown: https://0x0.st/H5-f.jpg
Feb 20 23:15:37 <mrcoffee>	leftyfb but shouldnt that be fixed with fsck ?
Feb 20 23:15:52 <mrcoffee>	Meaning i have run dpkg and fsck and the issue persists.
Feb 20 23:16:58 <leftyfb>	ok, first off, I don't know why you keep mentioning dpkg. It has nothing to do with shutting down, fsck or any of the symptoms you are experiencing
Feb 20 23:17:27 <mrcoffee>	Well, for instance running dpkg fixes the issue but just for one loop.
Feb 20 23:17:37 <mrcoffee>	Dont know why or how, but it does.
Feb 20 23:17:39 <leftyfb>	negative
Feb 20 23:17:56 <leftyfb>	mrcoffee: what is the exact command you are running?
Feb 20 23:18:35 <mrcoffee>	On boot, i do the boot ubuntu on safe mode or something like that and then you get the options dpkg, fsck and so on.. resume normal boot
Feb 20 23:19:03 <leftyfb>	please get specifics and share them here
Feb 20 23:19:40 <mrcoffee>	Ubuntu recovery mode dpkg option, that fixes the issue for one loop..
Feb 20 23:19:48 <mrcoffee>	THen the issue shows up again..
Feb 20 23:19:53 <leftyfb>	please take a screenshot
Feb 20 23:19:56 <mrcoffee>	And i posted an image with what i get on shutdown
Feb 20 23:19:59 <mrcoffee>	THats all there is.
Feb 20 23:20:12 <leftyfb>	please take a screenshot of this "dpkg" message you are seeing
Feb 20 23:22:39 <mrcoffee>	https://i.stack.imgur.com/fdmNg.png
Feb 20 23:23:11 <leftyfb>	ok, that menu item isn't allowing you to boot
Feb 20 23:23:20 <leftyfb>	why are you going into recovery mode to begin with?
Feb 20 23:27:03 <mrcoffee>	Let me start again leftyfb
Feb 20 23:27:35 <mrcoffee>	I have a lenovo legion 5 with dual boot, when i power off the maching it never does totally, it says powering off and hangs in there forever.
Feb 20 23:27:44 <mrcoffee>	https://0x0.st/H5-f.jpg
Feb 20 23:28:25 <mrcoffee>	Some suggestions have been to edit the grub file:
Feb 20 23:31:22 <plastikman>	you have ACPI issues
Feb 20 23:31:42 <plastikman>	I would recomend that you fix your ACPI tables then inject them into the kernel and try again
Feb 21 00:01:33 <oerheks>	check for a bios update for that lenovo 5

Feb 21 02:42:29 <chico_>	So, how does this work?
Feb 21 02:43:01 <sarnold>	just like that :)
Feb 21 02:43:11 <sarnold>	you ask a question and hang out for a while and if someone knows, they'll reply
Feb 21 02:44:53 <chico_>	got it, thanks! :)
Feb 21 02:52:43 <chico_>	App images(like or dislike)?
Feb 21 02:53:19 <sarnold>	they're usually big blobs of binary things supplied by someone else, i'm not a fan
Feb 21 02:53:29 <sarnold>	but loads of people seem to like them, so maybe i'm in the wrong on this
Feb 21 02:55:12 <chico_>	True, I use them but it's because I can store them on usb to save hard drive space without the need of installing from deb
Feb 21 02:55:54 <rbox>	i like big blobs and i can not lie
Feb 21 02:56:02 <sarnold>	app images usually bundle all their libraries etc.. a deb will probably re-use *some* of the libraries you've already got installed

Feb 21 03:30:10 <mrcoffee>	Hi there
Feb 21 03:30:26 <mrcoffee>	Booting in ubuntu using a previous kernel fixed the issue.
Feb 21 03:30:37 <mrcoffee>	Still would be cool to be able to use tha latest one.
Feb 21 03:30:50 <mrcoffee>	Guess its in the works.
Feb 21 03:47:32 <Guest3913>	I am trying to setup a VPN for the first time in Ubuntu Studio, anyone familiar with how to do this?
Feb 21 05:35:47 <sem>	Do you have all the info needed to connect?
Feb 21 06:06:20 <P1ro>	Hi, i was messing with limits.conf and 99-sysctl.conf, i lose access over local keyboard, any user or even root, i can only access tru ssh and user, but sudo su dont work ( su: cannot open session: Cannot make/remove an entry for the specified session ) i can sudo -i or sudo root /bin/bash, i set all files back to default (from a backup) but i cant still access local, only ss and still cant "sudo su"
Feb 21 06:06:36 <P1ro>	also try to create a new user, but same issue
Feb 21 06:14:03 <sem>	Can you backup data and reinstall?
Feb 21 06:15:17 <P1ro>	sem: yes i could, but i wanna know why this is happening
Feb 21 06:23:09 <sem>	I am not smart enough to know ... Maybe if you describe it on askubuntu more people will get a chance to see it P1ro
Feb 21 06:23:53 <P1ro>	sem using ubuntu
Feb 21 07:21:25 <Menzador>	P1ro: Why do you want to do [ sudo su ]?
Feb 21 07:22:22 <P1ro>	Menzador: is not all about sudo su, its about the issue, whici is not letting me login from local
Feb 21 07:22:26 <P1ro>	only tru ssh
Feb 21 07:23:03 <Menzador>	Why did you mess with limits.conf and 99-sysctl.conf?
Feb 21 07:23:11 <Menzador>	What was your intent?
Feb 21 07:23:21 <P1ro>	im doing stress test
Feb 21 07:25:24 <Menzador>	If you're just doing a CPU stress test, mprime would've done the trick
Feb 21 07:27:51 <Menzador>	At any rate, if you still have SSH access to the system, as a user in the sudo group, you may be able to restore things as they were
Feb 21 07:33:11 <Menzador>	I assume this persists across a reboot?
Feb 21 07:36:51 <P1ro>	Menzador: yes, persist atfer reboots
Feb 21 07:37:11 <P1ro>	Menzador: yes, i can access with ssh and sudo -i or sudo -u root /bin/bash
Feb 21 07:38:03 <Menzador>	And you said you restored the original configuration files from a backup, correct?
Feb 21 07:39:12 <P1ro>	Menzador: yes, i have commented the lines i have changed in the past, still trying to figure if there is something i have restore, even made a python script to compare files with backup
Feb 21 09:20:44 <bleusman>	can i have my money back ?

Feb 21 11:51:39 <antid>	I don't think so. I just want altgr to be an 'activating key' for dead keys
Feb 21 11:52:42 <antid>	I have this set up not in gnome on another computer, but it seems like the US intl. dead keys and US alt intl. keyboard layouts don't match what I was expecting
Feb 21 11:53:11 <lotuspsychje>	antid: so you want to remap a dead key to altgr right?
Feb 21 11:53:20 <lotuspsychje>	make it work again
Feb 21 13:28:10 <ph88^>	I'm trying to make a systemd timer these are the files i have created https://bpa.st/ZIHA i have put the systemd .service and .timer file in /etc/systemd/system  I don't see the timer show up when i do systemctl list-timers   how can i install the timer correctly so that it shows up and runs?

Feb 21 14:29:14 <Guest44>	I fresh installed ubuntu-server 22.04 lts. After installing nvidia drivers with one gpu everything worked ok. After adding another three my boot gets stuck. "i915 0000:00:02:0: enabling device (0000 -> 0003)"
Feb 21 14:29:21 <Guest44>	And doesnt move anywhere, what to do ?
Feb 21 14:30:07 <Guest44>	if I add "nomodeset" to grub config I can boot the server but it doesnt have a functioning network manager
Feb 21 14:30:15 <Guest44>	 no internet

Feb 21 15:02:10 <Guest44>	ok strangely it started working after bios update, even though there was no mention of i915 there just  uefi vuln fixes in description
Feb 21 15:03:05 <Guest44>	man fixing things is like black magic sometimes
Feb 21 15:03:10 <Guest44>	black as in black box
Feb 21 15:21:34 <peirik>	Is it possible to exempt files from certain directories from being included in recorded file history? I know I can disable file history completely in Settings->Privacy, but I would like to be able to say that any files accessed under /some/path should not be recorded/logged.

Feb 21 16:56:42 <ravage>	just for the record: tracker should respect a .trackerignore file and not index that directory. works like a .gitignore file
Feb 21 17:43:43 <xrandr>	Hello. I was wondering if anyone can help me create a XFS filesystem ontop of a ZFS pool. I am using Ubuntu 22.4
Feb 21 17:44:22 <ravage>	That sounds like a not so great idea. But what is the problem?
Feb 21 17:45:19 <xrandr>	I have a storage server that has 7 3.84 TB drives in it. I created a zpool with the drives in it as a RAIDZ2. I need to install XFS over it so that Veeam can use its fast cloning ability\
Feb 21 17:49:32 <ravage>	zfs create -s -V 50G ssd/xfs_data; mkfs.xfs /dev/zvol/ssd/xfs_data
Feb 21 17:50:27 <ravage>	ssd is the pool name. and you maybe want a different size
Feb 21 17:51:09 <ravage>	also -s is sparse. so if you want to really reserve the whole space dont use that
Feb 21 18:06:57 <xrandr>	thank you
Feb 21 18:09:01 <ashafq>	Is Gnome calendar default on Ubuntu 24.04?
Feb 21 18:09:10 <lotuspsychje>	!next | ashafq
Feb 21 18:09:10 <ubottu>	ashafq: Noble Numbat is the codename for Ubuntu 24.04. For technical support, see #ubuntu-next. For testing and QA feedback and help, see #ubuntu-quality.
Feb 21 18:10:13 <oerheks>	yes, gnome calendar is available standard for years now
Feb 21 18:10:34 <oerheks>	but lotuspsychje is correct, join #next for support
Feb 21 18:10:59 <leftyfb>	ashafq: you were told 3 days ago to seek support for unreleased versions of ubuntu in #ubuntu-next. It was also recommended not to install it unless you are interested in finding and reporting bugs
Feb 21 18:12:10 *	oerheks makes a note
Feb 21 18:24:15 <ashafq>	Did anyone make Gnome calendar work with iCloud account?
Feb 21 18:24:22 <ashafq>	leftyfb, thanks for your reply.
Feb 21 18:25:09 <leftyfb>	ashafq: https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/nzi1p1/comment/h1pm2td/
Feb 21 18:25:12 <leftyfb>	not sure if it works
Feb 21 18:25:50 <ashafq>	leftyfb, I saw that tutorial and that did not work.
Feb 21 18:25:51 <leftyfb>	ashafq: personally, I don't use the icloud calendar, I add my google calendars to my iphone as good is more portable
Feb 21 18:26:00 <leftyfb>	good/google
Feb 21 18:29:29 <oerheks>	iCloud offers a CalDAV format, so yes
Feb 21 18:31:09 <ashafq>	oerheks: it's been crashing my gnome calendar. Maybe I should update it or compile a newer version?
Feb 21 18:32:11 <oerheks>	update what ubuntu version?
Feb 21 18:32:26 <leftyfb>	ashafq: first test the URL you have on another client. See if it works before assuming the issue is with gnome calendar
Feb 21 18:32:42 <ashafq>	leftyfb: works on thunderbird.
Feb 21 18:32:46 <oerheks>	also evolution works with icloud calendar.
Feb 21 18:33:13 <leftyfb>	then I would file a bug with gnome calendar
Feb 21 18:34:56 <xrandr>	ravage: you are awesome. Thank you so much!
Feb 21 18:35:06 <ashafq>	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calendar/-/tags/41.2 this is the version I have installed.
Feb 21 18:35:23 <ashafq>	I doubt I can just update gnome-calendar without updating Gnome
Feb 21 18:35:58 <ravage>	https://snapcraft.io/gnome-calendar
Feb 21 18:36:01 <leftyfb>	ashafq: I would first look at the later versions to see if the bug has even been addressed
Feb 21 18:36:15 <oerheks>	41.2 kinetic?
Feb 21 18:36:30 <leftyfb>	41.2-3 is jammy

Feb 21 20:09:01 <oerheks>	itai, yes you can, limit it to 2 versions >> sudo snap set system refresh.retain=2
Feb 21 20:09:06 <oerheks>	or 1, go wild?

Feb 22 01:53:27 <iamrandom56>	hi
Feb 22 04:03:36 <signofzeta>	hey, my logs are suddenly getting spammed with AppArmor notifications about the Firefox snap, which I don't even have installed.  I switched it out for the official Mozilla Firefox DEB some time ago, but the errors started today:
Feb 22 04:03:40 <signofzeta>	kernel: audit: type=1400 audit(1708570824.177:1883145407): apparmor="DENIED" operation="recvmsg" class="net" profile="snap.firefox.firefox" pid=275179 comm=4E65746C696E6B204D6F6E69746F72 family="netlink" sock_type="raw" protocol=0 requested_mask="receive" denied_mask="receive"
Feb 22 04:03:54 <signofzeta>	It wouldn't be so bad if AppArmor notifications didn't pop up at the top of my screen.
Feb 22 04:04:20 <signofzeta>	I checked /etc/apparmor.d, but I only see the usr.bin.firefox file, not a snap.firefox.firefox file.

Feb 22 09:23:57 <r1911>	how do i report a gnome bug in launchpad? the project list in https://bugs.launchpad.net/gnome/+filebug only includes some random applications
Feb 22 09:26:39 <arraybolt3>	If it's against an application, file it against that application. If it's against the DE itself, probably file it against gnome-shell.
Feb 22 09:26:54 <arraybolt3>	(it might not be the right package but it should at least be close)
Feb 22 09:27:07 <r1911>	arraybolt3: there's no gnome-shell there
Feb 22 09:27:17 <arraybolt3>	run ubuntu-bug gnome-shell in a terminal
Feb 22 09:27:33 <r1911>	ah ok that's how it works
Feb 22 09:27:47 <arraybolt3>	you still end up filling out the bug report in a web browser, but that's the easy way to get things going.
Feb 22 09:27:53 <r1911>	is the settings app correct for gnome-shell?
Feb 22 09:28:10 <r1911>	it's about a bug in the settings app
Feb 22 09:28:43 <arraybolt3>	r1911: you probably want gnome-control-center then
Feb 22 09:28:49 <r1911>	ok
Feb 22 09:28:51 <arraybolt3>	the settings app is a separate one

Feb 22 12:00:29 <Wyslijp16>	Thanks lotuspsychje
Feb 22 12:00:38 <Wyslijp16>	And I only need one USB to do this ?
Feb 22 12:01:56 <mrtnt>	looks like I should use the "ignore-carrier"
Feb 22 12:16:01 <darwin>	somehoh $PATH got messed up so if I type stuff like rsync,ssh, it tells me the server options instead of just doing the client command... and why would the servers even have same name as the clients--UNIX named scripts like rc.server for a reason!
Feb 22 12:17:19 <darwin>	it may have been that I used a command to set path like I did on the one remaining strictly UNIX-like GNU/Linux... I'll remove that command

Feb 22 13:00:10 <oner>	hello. Is that a common random chat service?
Feb 22 13:02:13 <CosmicDJ>	this chat is kinda weird today...
Feb 22 13:03:44 <r1911>	CosmicDJ: if you think that, don't join #linux
Feb 22 13:05:43 <eneslogar>	hi
Feb 22 13:09:07 <oerheks>	:-)
Feb 22 13:11:49 <imi>	hi, my mcedit says [-MRO] in the fop left on the right hand side of the filename M stands for modified (unsaved changes), O stands for overwrite mode (insert key pressed). But what does R stand for?
Feb 22 13:16:59 <oerheks>	imi,  i think recording macro ??
Feb 22 13:17:00 <oerheks>	https://softpanorama.org/OFM/MC/mcedit.shtml
Feb 22 13:17:09 <oerheks>	took some time to find out
Feb 22 13:19:20 <imi>	why didn't that R go away then if I exited mcedit and launched it again? how do I make it go away?
Feb 22 13:19:57 <imi>	how do I disable this macro functionality completely?
Feb 22 13:20:05 <imi>	what does it even do?
Feb 22 13:20:35 <oerheks>	macros are a bunch of command you use frequently?
Feb 22 13:23:14 <imi>	seems like this macro functionality works across mc-mcedit boundary as well. in both directions even maybe

Feb 22 15:03:57 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Feb 22 15:46:36 <matdev>	hi guys, why on ubuntu 22.04 after I installed cron and did "service cron start", I can not do "service cron enable" so it starts daemon after reboot?
Feb 22 15:50:05 <oerheks>	systemctl start cron.service // systemctl enable cron.service
Feb 22 15:52:42 <matdev>	oerheks: hmm, I tried systemctl enable cron and systemctl enable cron.service +start both, it does not work after reboot (testing it in docker & docker restart)
Feb 22 15:54:13 <oerheks>	with sudo ofcourse
Feb 22 15:58:28 <detlef>	Hi diogeness
Feb 22 15:58:47 <diogeness>	HI detlef
Feb 22 15:59:12 <detlef>	I have still the problem, that my system does not come up completely, after going to sleep
Feb 22 15:59:59 <diogeness>	detlef: then maybe use hibernation until it gets a better support?
Feb 22 16:00:31 <detlef>	What works, is a VT, when i go to /run/user/1000 and start busybox ash
Feb 22 16:01:13 <detlef>	I must activate the VT and login, before going to sleep
Feb 22 16:01:49 <detlef>	I see, that my root device is in ro mode
Feb 22 16:03:41 <detlef>	And any command, which access my disc drive, blocks the VT (Failure Message: "Bus Error")
Feb 22 16:05:45 <detlef>	@diogeness, hibernation is named "Bereitschaft" on my german system and has the same failure.
Feb 22 16:07:00 <diogeness>	detlef: what does this command show: cat /sys/power/mem_sleep
Feb 22 16:07:11 <detlef>	@diogeness, "until it gets a better support" is, why i am here. I want to help to find the reason for the issue and help to fix it
Feb 22 16:07:51 <detlef>	at the moment, s2idle
Feb 22 16:08:08 <matdev>	oerheks: sure, I did it logged as root
Feb 22 16:08:39 <diogeness>	detlef: try this: echo deep | sudo tee /sys/power/mem_sleep
Feb 22 16:08:55 <diogeness>	and check cat /sys/power/mem_sleep
Feb 22 16:13:13 <detlef>	even after "sudo su", writing to /sys/power/mem_sleep does not work.  Translatio for the error message might be: Illegal argument
Feb 22 16:14:26 <detlef>	owner of /sys/power/mem_sleep is root with rw access rights.
Feb 22 16:18:40 <diogeness>	detlef: cat /sys/power/mem_sleep
Feb 22 16:18:46 <diogeness>	what does it say?
Feb 22 16:21:00 <matdev>	oerheks: try this with docker if you can https://pastebin.com/raw/ANKkicLc
Feb 22 16:22:28 <detlef>	@diogeness, only [s2idle]
Feb 22 16:23:12 <matdev>	oerheks: this is my output: https://pastebin.com/raw/cWrup1Wi
Feb 22 16:23:30 <diogeness>	detlef: run: sudo nano  /etc/default/grub
Feb 22 16:24:13 <diogeness>	to the line that starts with linux add: mem_sleep_default=deep
Feb 22 16:24:45 <diogeness>	after that save, close and run: cat  /etc/default/grub | nc termbin.com 9999
Feb 22 16:24:54 <detlef>	i will try that
Feb 22 16:24:55 <diogeness>	share the output
Feb 22 16:31:04 <detlef>	https://termbin.com/sc79
Feb 22 16:38:36 <detlef>	diogeness, any advice, before i reboot now and then try sleep/wakeup?
Feb 22 16:39:38 <detlef>	diogeness, testing the changes... bbl
Feb 22 16:39:41 <diogeness>	detlef: run:
Feb 22 16:39:43 <diogeness>	wait
Feb 22 16:39:51 <detlef>	ok, waiting
Feb 22 16:39:53 <diogeness>	run: sudo update-grub
Feb 22 16:39:56 <diogeness>	then reboot
Feb 22 16:40:03 <detlef>	i did that already
Feb 22 16:40:14 <diogeness>	ok reboot

Feb 22 21:21:49 <jwash>	ok
Feb 22 21:21:57 <jwash>	so you likely have a permission issue

Feb 22 21:24:20 <lpd>	great, but I am a beginner ... how to add my user to group scanner? By the way, I found the program on the web and download an istallation file with tar.gz
Feb 22 21:24:59 <jwash>	sudo apt install gscan2pdf
Feb 22 21:25:19 <jwash>	do you have sudo on that computer (the ability to install files)?
Feb 22 21:25:33 <lpd>	I am using sudo often, yes
Feb 22 21:25:44 <jwash>	there you go
Feb 22 21:25:55 <jwash>	install gscan2pdf from the command line
Feb 22 21:25:58 <jwash>	just like above
Feb 22 21:26:09 <jwash>	then:
Feb 22 21:26:25 <jwash>	sudo usermod -a -G scanner lpd
Feb 22 21:26:32 <jwash>	replace lpd with your user name

Feb 22 21:31:45 <lpd>	same with ubuntu 23.10 right?

Feb 22 21:32:52 <jwash>	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/mantic/+package/tesseract-ocr
Feb 22 21:34:11 <lpd>	ok, I installed it
Feb 22 21:35:41 <lpd>	gscan2pdf typed on terminal
Feb 22 21:36:53 <lpd>	the system opens for me a web page with the program name gscan2pdf but after few seconds it says "no device found"
Feb 22 21:37:46 <lpd>	Ok, it appears I have installed the gscan2pdf and it appears I can open the program but still the same problem: even this app cannot se the scanner
Feb 22 21:39:27 <ioria>	lpd, and simple-scan can see it ?
Feb 22 21:40:36 <lpd>	I confirm, now the app gscan2pdf availabel, I can open it but when I instruct "check scanners available" the answer is "no scanners found"
Feb 22 21:40:42 <Elliria>	I may have missed the beginning of this, but is the scanner connected by a wire or is it wireless?
Feb 22 21:41:02 <lpd>	wireless, 192.168.1.30 and I can ping it
Feb 22 21:41:11 <Elliria>	Can you plug it in with a wire?
Feb 22 21:41:39 <Elliria>	Mine has to be plugged in even though it works as a wireless scanner with Windows and both of my tablets. Kubuntu simply cannot see it if it's wireless/
Feb 22 21:42:06 <lpd>	... maybe but that is not of use to me ... I need to access the scanner form three different points and wireless access woul fit - please note it was working until few weeks ago!
Feb 22 21:42:22 <Elliria>	Ah, okay. I missed that part. Sorry.
Feb 22 21:42:27 <ioria>	lpd, do you have  simple-scan installed ?
Feb 22 21:42:48 <lpd>	No, I didn't mention before my needs.
Feb 22 21:42:54 <lpd>	Let me check simple-scan
Feb 22 21:43:24 <jp__>	anyone here with experience with the synology ubuntu docker image and using it?
Feb 22 21:43:32 <jp__>	i installed it but now uncertain how to log in
Feb 22 21:44:38 <lpd>	I cannot find "simple-scan" as available APP, I have "document scanner"
Feb 22 21:44:52 <ioria>	lpd, it's the same
Feb 22 21:45:26 <lpd>	great. still I cannot believe it was working before and then stop

Feb 23 01:22:09 <RjG>	loaded question... is there an updated guide for 23.10 or a tool to convert an existing swap part on a secondary drive to an encrypted swap that will automount on system boot?

Feb 23 16:17:44 <Idrogeno>	@oerheks thanks for the direction.. This keyboard has a "gaming mode" button I've never touched or seen, and apparently it disabled my winkey.  Just happened to push the button around a restart.
Feb 23 16:18:59 <oerheks>	Idrogeno, nice spot!
Feb 23 16:19:43 <dtomato>	Idrogeno: hah! I had a keyboard like that once, and I've had on occasion run into the case where I forgot to re-enabled that key :D
Feb 23 16:20:02 <Idrogeno>	I finally found the "keyboard input test" in ubuntu settings and saw it wasn't being registered at all, but the lack of an Fn key threw me off
Feb 23 16:20:59 <dtomato>	what kind of obscure key combination do you have to do to turn it on and off then if it doesn't have Fn key or some form of dedicated switch?
Feb 23 16:21:56 <Idrogeno>	It has a "G" button in the top left
Feb 23 16:22:01 <Idrogeno>	thats apparently a "gaming mode"
Feb 23 16:24:29 <dtomato>	heh, well yeah, you don't want to tab out of the game and messing those headshots!
Feb 23 17:56:03 <Guest95>	hello everyone
Feb 23 17:57:24 <oerheks>	:-)
Feb 23 18:02:00 <iconoclast_hero>	is there any sort of official guidance on how to add a new btrfs OS to the existing GRUB?
Feb 23 18:02:18 <iconoclast_hero>	for whatever reason, grub-update doesn't want to add anything including the windows partition that was originally there.
Feb 23 18:02:46 <iconoclast_hero>	which is annoying, but i can't get it to see the OS i just put on a btrfs part.
Feb 23 18:02:54 <iconoclast_hero>	and the advice out there sucks.
Feb 23 18:04:40 <oerheks>	that would be the OS-prober blocking
Feb 23 18:05:04 <oerheks>	https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/12/grub-doesnt-detect-windows-linux-distros-fix
Feb 23 18:05:14 <oerheks>	blocked due to security reasons.
Feb 23 18:06:33 <oerheks>	no experience with btrfs, but this guide should work https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/102bjk7/a_great_howto_for_setting_up_timeshift_and/
Feb 23 18:07:46 <iconoclast_hero>	oh.
Feb 23 18:07:55 <iconoclast_hero>	mother f-cker.
Feb 23 18:08:05 <iconoclast_hero>	that was a simple fix.
Feb 23 18:08:07 <iconoclast_hero>	thank you
Feb 23 18:08:27 <iconoclast_hero>	it's great that canonical put that information in the grub-update script they're using.
Feb 23 18:08:41 <oerheks>	have fun!
Feb 23 18:08:41 <iconoclast_hero>	so that end users don't waste hours upon hours trying to figure out what the f-ck is going on.
Feb 23 18:08:54 <iconoclast_hero>	there's a better way for the btrfs though
Feb 23 18:09:08 <oerheks>	oh good to know, thanks.
Feb 23 18:10:22 <iconoclast_hero>	i can't find it
Feb 23 18:10:24 <iconoclast_hero>	sorry
Feb 23 18:11:40 <iconoclast_hero>	so basically, i nvme0n1p10 is the new btrfs part...
Feb 23 18:11:41 <iconoclast_hero>	$ cd /media/; mkdir ./10; sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p10 ./10; cd 10; ln -s @/boot /boot; ln -s @/etc /etc
Feb 23 18:11:51 <iconoclast_hero>	then sudo os-prober to make sure it will find it
Feb 23 18:12:04 <iconoclast_hero>	then you can sudo update-grub
Feb 23 18:12:38 <iconoclast_hero>	its also anoying that I can't export that grub variable so i can enable the os-prober temporarily
Feb 23 18:13:08 <iconoclast_hero>	https://askubuntu.com/questions/967172/grub2-does-not-detect-btrfs-partition/1032354#1032354
Feb 23 18:13:11 <iconoclast_hero>	^^
Feb 23 18:13:50 <iconoclast_hero>	that except that it doesn't work for the current OS which is probably moot.  once one bootsinto the other os, it would behoove one to also do it on the root of that brtrfs part as well.
Feb 23 18:15:07 <iconoclast_hero>	ok, time to see if it worked.
Feb 23 18:35:43 <sem>	i am trying a usb live image for lubuntu, so far it doesn't work after grub... trying to figure out if it is a me problem, or a bios/hardware problem
Feb 23 18:37:16 <sem>	it boots from USB into grub, but then when I select a bootline from grub, it hangs after "booting a command list"
Feb 23 18:37:32 <diogeness>	sem: how did you write the ISO to the USB drive?
Feb 23 18:37:39 <sem>	etcher
Feb 23 18:37:46 <sem>	on windows
Feb 23 18:38:09 <diogeness>	ok as soon as you reach grub menu hit 'e'.
Feb 23 18:38:10 <sem>	i found this which blames bios https://askubuntu.com/questions/1307514/live-usb-hangs-after-selecting-grub-menu-entry-new-pc
Feb 23 18:38:18 <sem>	already did diogeness
Feb 23 18:38:54 <sem>	now I am getting "error: unknown filesystem" underneath 'booting a command list' so that's progress
Feb 23 18:39:09 <diogeness>	on the linux line remove quiet splash and replace it with noapic
Feb 23 18:39:26 <diogeness>	then hit ctrl+x and see if you get any output.
Feb 23 18:40:08 <sem>	thanks I'll try noapic. Maybe I should try another USB drive also
Feb 23 18:40:28 <sem>	what is the diffrence between noapic and no1apic
Feb 23 18:41:35 <sem>	diogeness, now I get "error: attempt to read outside hd00, load the kernel first" or something like that -- it went back to grub
Feb 23 18:42:45 <diogeness>	yeah pretty much could be a BIOS issue.
Feb 23 18:43:21 <sem>	ok... maybe i can install windows and upgrade bios
Feb 23 18:44:21 <diogeness>	good idea ^^^
Feb 23 18:50:32 <iconoclast_hero>	hey so yeah, that got it to grub.
Feb 23 18:50:32 <iconoclast_hero>	it won't boot up, but i assume that if i get to a kernel panic that's not the fault of grub.
Feb 23 19:04:33 <sem>	looks like it IS installing now with a different USB drive -- it is just extremely slow
Feb 23 19:04:52 <sem>	e.g. took a long time for any messages to show up on screen

Feb 23 19:37:12 <oerheks>	have fun!
Feb 23 19:38:21 <dave>	this is ubunto studio 22.4 i think had a good review
Feb 23 19:39:22 <chico_>	dave: This is ubuntu support
Feb 23 19:40:09 <dave>	sorry all new to me
Feb 23 19:40:25 <dave>	wont bother anyone

Feb 23 20:21:40 <Taylor46>	Hello, I've got a problem with installing the linux on a Ubuntu 23.04 system. I've added the required links to my /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs/list https://dpaste.com/3BDDTQ3R9, but when I run sudo apt-get update, I get the following output https://dpaste.com/GZDAPUQGU. If anyone has any suggestions as to what the problem could be, that would be
Feb 23 20:21:40 <Taylor46>	great.
Feb 23 20:22:21 <Taylor46>	Hello, I've got a problem with installing the linux kernel with debug symbols on a Ubuntu 23.04 system. I've added the required links to my /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs/list https://dpaste.com/3BDDTQ3R9, but when I run sudo apt-get update, I get the following output https://dpaste.com/GZDAPUQGU. If anyone has any suggestions as to what the problem
Feb 23 20:22:21 <Taylor46>	could be, that would be great.
Feb 23 20:22:48 <Taylor46>	Whoops, didn't mean to double post. Apologies
Feb 23 20:23:48 <ravage>	install 23.10
Feb 23 20:24:26 <leftyfb>	Taylor46: Ubuntu 23.04 is End of Life and no longer supported
Feb 23 20:24:36 <ravage>	or the latest LTS release: 22.04
Feb 23 20:25:09 <leftyfb>	that's always my preferred suggestion
Feb 23 20:25:51 <oerheks>	for nerds who want to help testing, #next LTS will be released in april
Feb 23 20:25:56 <oerheks>	!next
Feb 23 20:25:57 <ubottu>	Noble Numbat is the codename for Ubuntu 24.04. For technical support, see #ubuntu-next. For testing and QA feedback and help, see #ubuntu-quality.
Feb 23 20:27:50 <Taylor46>	I don't think I'm able to update the system, since it's a managed PC. If there's an alternate solution that would be preferable
Feb 23 20:28:28 <leftyfb>	Taylor46: tell whoever manages it to update it
Feb 23 20:29:33 <Voidwarper>	I installed 22.04.2 LTS and if run the 6.5 kernel
Feb 23 20:29:49 <Voidwarper>	I want the 5.15 kernel, can I get 22.04
Feb 23 20:30:22 <Voidwarper>	Also what is the hwe kernel
Feb 23 20:30:24 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: yes, from ubuntu.com
Feb 23 20:30:42 <oerheks>	https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases/22.04/release/
Feb 23 20:31:02 <Voidwarper>	How can I see which kernel this runs
Feb 23 20:31:04 <oerheks>	oops, wrong
Feb 23 20:31:41 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: uname -a
Feb 23 20:31:55 <Voidwarper>	I mean before downloading it
Feb 23 20:32:21 <Voidwarper>	Also does the net installer have support for wifi firmware? I want to get this as it's smaller
Feb 23 20:32:32 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: why do you need a specific kernel?
Feb 23 20:32:50 <Voidwarper>	I have issues with newer kernels
Feb 23 20:32:56 <Voidwarper>	With Intel iris igpu
Feb 23 20:33:07 <chico_>	uname -r
Feb 23 20:33:26 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: there is no "net installer"
Feb 23 20:34:10 <Voidwarper>	I saw a net installer at alternate downloads
Feb 23 20:34:12 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: are you saying 6.5 does or doesn't work with your GPU?
Feb 23 20:34:35 <Voidwarper>	It causes artifacts like screen blanking for a sec
Feb 23 20:35:15 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: which kernel on which distro did you try where you got there?
Feb 23 20:35:16 <leftyfb>	that*
Feb 23 20:35:56 <Voidwarper>	I tried Ubuntu and others
Feb 23 20:36:08 <Voidwarper>	The 6.1 LTS performed the best
Feb 23 20:36:19 <Voidwarper>	But I want to try the 5.15 line
Feb 23 20:36:32 <chico_>	if the 5.15 kernel is installed you can boot into it thru the grub menu
Feb 23 20:36:39 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: so you tried Ubuntu 22.04 with the latest 6.5 kernel that was just released last night?
Feb 23 20:37:11 <Voidwarper>	I am on 22.04.02 now with 6.5
Feb 23 20:37:25 <chico_>	this is the output of uname -a on my system
Feb 23 20:37:27 <chico_>	Linux EVC141-6bk 6.5.0-18-generic #18~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed Feb  7 11:40:03 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Feb 23 20:37:31 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: then you are wildly out of date
Feb 23 20:37:50 <Voidwarper>	What do you mean
Feb 23 20:38:05 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: sudo apt update ; sudo apt full-upgrade
Feb 23 20:38:14 <leftyfb>	run that and reboot, then come back here
Feb 23 20:38:28 <Voidwarper>	This won't help me, I tried the latest stable kernel as well
Feb 23 20:38:32 <Voidwarper>	As the mainline
Feb 23 20:38:44 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: sudo apt update ; sudo apt full-upgrade ; sudo apt install linux-image-generic-hwe-22.04
Feb 23 20:38:45 <leftyfb>	run that and reboot, then come back here
Feb 23 20:39:15 <Voidwarper>	What version is the generic hwe
Feb 23 20:39:20 <Voidwarper>	6.75?
Feb 23 20:39:24 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: please run the commands
Feb 23 20:39:32 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: reboot then come back here
Feb 23 20:40:07 <Voidwarper>	I am on 22.04.2 iso
Feb 23 20:40:11 <Voidwarper>	Which I just got
Feb 23 20:40:21 <Voidwarper>	It's up to date
Feb 23 20:40:30 <leftyfb>	it's not
Feb 23 20:40:40 <leftyfb>	ok, install ubuntu, update all the packages, reboot and come back here
Feb 23 20:41:03 <oerheks>	if you updated, you would be on 22.04.5 now, with that 6.5 kernel?
Feb 23 20:42:19 <leftyfb>	22.04.4
Feb 23 20:42:52 <leftyfb>	which was released less than 24 hours ago
Feb 23 20:43:21 <oerheks>	lsb_release -a   .. oh right
Feb 23 20:44:08 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: also, booting from the live iso is not a definitive method to test hardware
Feb 23 20:45:59 <Voidwarper>	I am on 22.04.4
Feb 23 20:46:03 <Voidwarper>	Just installed
Feb 23 20:46:53 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: please run the following:   ( uname -a ; cat /etc/os-release ; lspci | grep -i vga ; lsblk ) | nc termbin.com 9999
Feb 23 20:46:59 <leftyfb>	then paste the resulting URL here
Feb 23 20:47:03 <Voidwarper>	Ok
Feb 23 20:51:16 <Voidwarper>	https://termbin.com/n8fu
Feb 23 20:52:25 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: are you still getting artifacts?
Feb 23 20:52:31 <Voidwarper>	Yes
Feb 23 20:52:49 <Voidwarper>	https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1220223
Feb 23 20:52:52 <Voidwarper>	This is the issue
Feb 23 20:52:55 -ubottu/#ubuntu-	bugzilla.opensuse.org bug 1220223 in openSUSE Tumbleweed "Screen flashing before and after GDM login on Iris Xe Graphics" [Normal, New]
Feb 23 20:53:10 <Voidwarper>	I had a video recorded on opensuse, the same happens on Ubuntu
Feb 23 20:53:29 <Voidwarper>	It was slightly better on Debian which runs the 6.1 kernel, but still not perfect
Feb 23 20:53:43 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: sudo apt install linux-image-generic &&  sudo apt remove linux-image-generic-hwe-22.04
Feb 23 20:53:50 <Voidwarper>	Oo
Feb 23 20:54:42 <leftyfb>	you could also try the oem kernel
Feb 23 20:54:47 <leftyfb>	sudo apt-get install linux-oem-22.04d
Feb 23 20:55:09 <Voidwarper>	I will try the generic you said and report
Feb 23 20:55:13 <leftyfb>	I would pick one or the other
Feb 23 20:56:52 <Voidwarper>	I did install the Linux image generic and remove the hwe
Feb 23 20:57:15 <Voidwarper>	Uname -r says 6.5.0-21-generic after reboot
Feb 23 20:57:18 <leftyfb>	you'll need to reboot into the 5.15 kernel
Feb 23 20:57:22 <Voidwarper>	Also grub menu doesn't appear
Feb 23 20:58:16 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: apt list installed linux-image* | nc termbin.com 9999
Feb 23 20:59:19 <Voidwarper>	termbin.com/z1pe
Feb 23 21:00:12 <leftyfb>	oh, sorry
Feb 23 21:00:16 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: apt list --installed linux-image* | nc termbin.com 9999
Feb 23 21:01:23 <Voidwarper>	termbin.com/2qeq
Feb 23 21:01:53 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: sudo apt remove linux-image-6.5.0-18-generic linux-image-6.5.0-21-generic
Feb 23 21:03:00 <phchu>	hi
Feb 23 21:04:40 <Voidwarper>	The problem persists on 5.15
Feb 23 21:04:51 <Voidwarper>	I suspect the Intel microcode
Feb 23 21:04:57 <Voidwarper>	Can I remove it?
Feb 23 21:05:19 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: the oem kernel is 6.1
Feb 23 21:05:36 <Voidwarper>	Ok will try the oem
Feb 23 21:05:40 <leftyfb>	and is typically for cutting edge hardware
Feb 23 21:06:26 <leftyfb>	you'll need to remove the 5.15 kernel after you install the oem kernel
Feb 23 21:13:39 <Voidwarper>	Problem persists, how can I remove Intel microcode without removing the kernel
Feb 23 21:13:58 <Voidwarper>	I think Debian worked better because of older Intel microcode
Feb 23 21:14:18 <Voidwarper>	Because I tried the same kernel 6.1 here too and it didn't behave well
Feb 23 21:14:50 <Voidwarper>	I want to remove or rollback the firmware for i915
Feb 23 21:17:12 <leftyfb>	Voidwarper: try: sudo apt install linux-firmware
Feb 23 21:17:34 <Voidwarper>	It's installed
Feb 23 21:17:57 <Voidwarper>	I found a thread where a similar issue was fixed by downgrading Intel ucode
Feb 23 21:18:05 <Voidwarper>	Intel microcode basically
Feb 23 21:18:43 <Voidwarper>	Does Ubuntu keep an archieve?

Feb 23 22:49:07 <jcdutton>	Has anyone else had problems install ubuntu from the 22.04 iso, booting from USB stick?   If I select custom partitions the installer just crashes with a long error log.   Has anyone actually tested the customer partitions option.
Feb 23 22:49:43 <jcdutton>	s/customer/custom
Feb 23 22:52:30 <oerheks>	on what type of hardware? UEFI or legacy mbr?
Feb 23 22:52:52 <oerheks>	other OS installed? like windows with their hybernate/fstboot?
Feb 23 22:52:57 <oerheks>	c/fastboot
Feb 23 22:58:18 <jcdutton>	oerheks, it is on UEFI.  If it helps, debian minimal installer installs fine.
Feb 23 22:58:53 <oerheks>	do you use the 1st 24.04 iso, or recent 24.04.4 ?
Feb 23 22:59:29 <jcdutton>	oerheks, it was this image: ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso
Feb 23 22:59:40 <leftyfb>	oerheks: %s/24/22/g
Feb 23 22:59:56 <oerheks>	oops, typo
Feb 23 23:03:00 <jcdutton>	oerheks, my custom partition is quite simple. 256MB for fat32 EFI, 1G for /BOOT ext2, and the rest of the disk encrypted with a btrfs filesystems
Feb 23 23:04:26 <jcdutton>	oerheks, exactly the same partition table installs fine with debian. debian-12.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso
Feb 23 23:09:00 <oerheks>	i find this post, https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2488588&p=14150479#post14150479
Feb 23 23:12:19 <jcdutton>	oerheks, ok, so the ubuntu installer basically fails if you try btrfs ?
Feb 23 23:13:30 <oerheks>	not sure that statement is true, 1st line ".. but it does not have installer template scripts like the Desktop Edition. "
Feb 23 23:13:39 <oerheks>	leftyfb, ^^ ??
Feb 23 23:14:10 <jcdutton>	oerheks, what is the template bit do?  I am doing a customer partition, so why is a template needed?
Feb 23 23:15:40 <jcdutton>	It would be ok if it came back and said something like "not a supported partition combination, letting me adjust it until it is happy, but it instead crashes the installer.
Feb 23 23:17:37 <oerheks>	you might want to reask in #ubuntu-server
Feb 23 23:17:47 <oerheks>	i have no clue there
Feb 23 23:26:17 <jcdutton>	oerheks, I have looked at another forum thread: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2491181       Ubuntu staff who respond seem to have a really bad attitude
Feb 23 23:29:19 <sarnold>	forums tend to foster that, even worse than irc
Feb 23 23:30:02 <jeremy31>	jcdutton: staff emeritus are retired staff members
Feb 23 23:46:01 <bray90820>	What does this error meanusb 1-5 device descriptor read 64 error 110
Feb 23 23:46:27 <bray90820>	usb 1-5 device descriptor read 64 error 110
Feb 23 23:47:04 <jeremy31>	bray90820: It could be a power issue on USB bus
Feb 23 23:47:36 <bray90820>	Even when nothing is plugged into said USB ports?
Feb 23 23:49:03 <bray90820>	jeremy31:
Feb 23 23:49:11 <jeremy31>	bray90820: Might be a faulty device?
Feb 23 23:49:17 <bray90820>	I hope not
Feb 23 23:49:40 <jeremy31>	bray90820: some webcams and most bluetooth devices use the USB bus
Feb 23 23:49:40 <JanC>	hope it's not the internal USB hub that is broken...
Feb 23 23:50:30 <JanC>	it could in theory also be a driver issue, but that's quite uncommon with USB nowadays
Feb 23 23:50:36 <bray90820>	This error happens even when nothing is plugged into the USB ports
Feb 23 23:50:45 <bray90820>	It happened after I replaced one of my fans
Feb 23 23:50:51 <JanC>	oh
Feb 23 23:51:15 <JanC>	hope you didn't break anything then
Feb 23 23:51:25 <jeremy31>	bray90820: Post URL from terminal for>  lsusb|nc termbin.com 9999
Feb 23 23:51:42 <bray90820>	There are currently USB devices plugged in just FYI
Feb 23 23:52:08 <jcdutton>	bray90820, USB messages like that can be caused by radio interference.
Feb 23 23:52:14 <bray90820>	Can you send the code again without pinging me

Feb 23 23:53:18 <bray90820>	https://termbin.com/fj56
Feb 23 23:54:49 <bray90820>	jeremy31: You got that?
Feb 23 23:54:56 <jeremy31>	bray90820: that shows a USB video device, a couple mice and an Asus AURA LED controller, and an ethernet device on USB
Feb 23 23:55:56 <bray90820>	Well I have a video card 1 mouse 1 keyboard and an ethernet port built into the motherboard
Feb 23 23:56:29 <bray90820>	I also have a scanner connected
Feb 23 23:56:53 <bray90820>	Oh I also have a USB3 hub and a USB3 KVM
Feb 23 23:57:23 <JanC>	if this error is on the internal USB hub (the one on the motherboard) then maybe also check if the wires that go to the USB sockets in various places in the computer case are properly connected?
Feb 23 23:57:45 <jeremy31>	Can you switch what port the KVM is on?
Feb 23 23:57:50 <JanC>	maybe you touched one of them while changing the fan...
Feb 23 23:57:51 <bray90820>	You mean like front USB ports?
Feb 23 23:58:08 <jeremy31>	bray90820: Maybe
Feb 23 23:58:20 <JanC>	yeah, for example (depends on the case where they are)
Feb 23 23:58:27 <bray90820>	Well I actually have the front USB ports disconnected currently
Feb 23 23:58:31 <jeremy31>	A lot of devices are on bus 001
Feb 23 23:58:34 <bray90820>	Nothing is connected to those headders
Feb 23 23:58:56 <rhombus>	I am using ufw and it does not appear to be working at all. As in, I have a default DENY policy, and I've added one rule for ssh (port 22), ufw status shows that rule and that it is active, and connections to ports other than 22 are getting through.
Feb 23 23:59:13 <JanC>	okay, that probably rules that out then
Feb 23 23:59:44 <bray90820>	So it's probablly the back USB ports?
Feb 24 00:00:11 <JanC>	those ports are usually directly on the motherboard, so it can't be a loose wire
Feb 24 00:00:31 <bray90820>	It happens even when no USB devices are connected
Feb 24 00:01:36 <JanC>	that's why I was thinking it's with (one of) the USB hub(s) on the motherboard
Feb 24 00:02:41 <bray90820>	Here is an image of the grub errors if you wanna have a look
Feb 24 00:02:42 <bray90820>	https://imgur.com/a/0jl5Pab
Feb 24 00:03:29 <JanC>	that's not a grub error  :)
Feb 24 00:03:39 <JanC>	and it says an USB device is connected
Feb 24 00:04:06 <bray90820>	I didn't mean it was a grub error i meant the errors show up after grub
Feb 24 00:04:35 <bray90820>	Should I disconenct every USB device and get  a new image?
Feb 24 00:04:40 <JanC>	there might be an internal device connected to USB
Feb 24 00:04:43 <jeremy31>	It almost has to be an issue with an internal hub
Feb 24 00:04:51 <bray90820>	So the board is bad?
Feb 24 00:05:12 <JanC>	you can try without anything connected to it
Feb 24 00:05:34 <jeremy31>	bray90820: URL for>  sudo dmesg|grep -i usb|nc termbin.com 9999
Feb 24 00:05:52 <rhombus>	I am also using lxd, which is known to "manage"/interfere with firewalls, in case that's relevant.
Feb 24 00:06:26 <bray90820>	jeremy31: https://termbin.com/rrse
Feb 24 00:09:52 <jeremy31>	I have no idea what the AURA LED Controller is, but it could be the problem
Feb 24 00:10:18 <JanC>	you might want to check visibly if all physical USB ports look okay (nothing damaged/broken or jammed in one of them that could cause a short for example :) )
Feb 24 00:10:59 <bray90820>	Actually It could very well be the LD
Feb 24 00:12:32 <bray90820>	I'm gonna try something I'll be right back
Feb 24 00:12:57 <JanC>	also, unplug/replug all devices 1 by 1 while watching "journalctl -f" could be useful to identify what device is "1-5"
Feb 24 00:16:01 <JanC>	rhombus: you should be able to use nft or iptables to see what firewall rules are actually loaded into the kernel
Feb 24 00:19:44 <JanC>	IIRC some stuff like routing/forwarding happens before the "normal" firewall rules that ufw sets?
Feb 24 00:22:24 <JanC>	maybe this is useful... https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/latest/howto/network_bridge_firewalld/ ?
Feb 24 00:29:44 <bray90820>	So I umplugged every USB device and the LED and this is what I get
Feb 24 00:29:45 <bray90820>	https://imgur.com/a/cQH8eLY
Feb 24 00:36:24 <oerheks>	sounds like a hw issue, check for a bios update?
Feb 24 00:37:12 <bray90820>	oerheks: Talking to me?
Feb 24 00:37:37 <oerheks>	yes?
Feb 24 00:38:04 <bray90820>	Ok
Feb 24 00:48:28 <rhombus>	JanC, I discovered that a recent upgrade of lxd mangled the rules in iptables and basically ufw wasn't having any effect anymore.
Feb 24 00:49:20 <rhombus>	JanC, I've resolved the problem by disabling the firewall in lxd according to the instructions here https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/latest/howto/network_bridge_firewalld/
Feb 24 00:50:00 <rhombus>	JanC, ha, I just saw that you linked that too :)
Feb 24 00:50:46 <rhombus>	JanC, I didn't consider this because it had been working without needing to explicitly disable it in lxd, but the upgrade did something to change that.
Feb 24 00:51:14 <rhombus>	Thanks for the tip all the same!
Feb 24 00:56:29 <jcdutton>	bray90820, it looks more like a RAM chip problem.  Those MCE errors are probably more the cause
Feb 24 01:17:59 <natewrench>	hey ive been getting java hangups that ive had to uninstall java
Feb 24 01:20:35 <sebast>	@natewrencj
Feb 24 01:22:02 <oerheks>	java or openjdk?
Feb 24 01:23:20 <sarnold>	sebast: most irc clients let you type a few characters of a nickname and then hit 'tab' to complete the rest
Feb 24 01:30:39 <natewrench>	oerheks: uh openjdk-default or default-jre
Feb 24 01:51:15 <zecred>	bababooey
Feb 24 01:51:52 <zecred>	wqehuqheiuqhwe
Feb 24 01:51:54 <zecred>	why
Feb 24 01:51:55 <zecred>	why
Feb 24 01:51:58 <zecred>	brh
Feb 24 01:52:16 <zecred>	o
Feb 24 01:53:14 <bray90820>	Welp looks like it was a CPUissue
Feb 24 01:57:25 <sarnold>	ugh, machine check exceptions, bad news :(
Feb 24 01:57:44 <sarnold>	maybe you can swap out memory or change the thermal points on your processor or something
Feb 24 01:57:50 <sarnold>	but mce is bad news :(
Feb 24 01:58:13 <bray90820>	I'll just Buy a new processor
Feb 24 02:00:28 <sarnold>	that may not address the problem if it's ram or motherboard or pci bridge or whatever
Feb 24 02:00:43 <sarnold>	it'll take debugging :(
Feb 24 02:09:57 <OldGrowth>	hello

Feb 25 04:06:22 <darwin>	i set an icon in /tmp/.directory because linked to /home/user/tmp for easier temporary usage, but my icon keeps disappearing because apparently the .directory keeps getting deleted... is there a way I can set it so whatever system service doesn't delete it?
Feb 25 04:06:33 <darwin>	what happened to installation-guide-amd64 package?
Feb 25 04:18:45 <JanC>	don't use a temporary directory to store things that aren't temporary?
Feb 25 04:24:00 <oerheks>	[<darwin> what happened to installation-guide-amd64 package? you asked before?
Feb 25 04:24:12 <oerheks>	not available anmore
Feb 25 05:15:08 <EriC^^[m]>	testies
Feb 25 05:32:22 <jacekowski>	hi people
Feb 25 05:32:31 <lotuspsychje>	welcome jacekowski
Feb 25 05:32:35 <jacekowski>	i have an issue with ubuntu not loading amdgpu automatically
Feb 25 05:33:02 <jacekowski>	which then messes up other things later during boot
Feb 25 05:33:41 <jacekowski>	i can modprobe it just fine
Feb 25 05:34:42 <lotuspsychje>	jacekowski: amdgpu module should load by default, unless the specific kernel comes to an error around
Feb 25 05:35:04 <lotuspsychje>	jacekowski: a good starting point is mention your ubuntu release and kernel version with the volunteers here
Feb 25 05:35:26 <lotuspsychje>	and upload your dmesg to a !paste service
Feb 25 05:35:41 <jacekowski>	it's not even attempting to load the module
Feb 25 05:35:56 <lotuspsychje>	thats possible yeah
Feb 25 05:36:08 <jacekowski>	Linux kubuntu 5.15.0-97-generic #107-Ubuntu SMP Wed Feb 7 13:26:48 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Feb 25 05:36:29 <jacekowski>	22.04.04
Feb 25 05:36:46 <jacekowski>	so i would expect the issue to be somwhere around initrd

Feb 25 05:39:24 <jacekowski>	i'm just booting it with debug in cmdline

Feb 25 05:50:56 <lotuspsychje>	yep unclaimed indeed
Feb 25 05:51:10 <lotuspsychje>	jacekowski: lets try the !HWE kernel as a test
Feb 25 05:51:15 <lotuspsychje>	!hwe | jacekowski
Feb 25 05:51:15 <ubottu>	jacekowski: The Ubuntu LTS enablement stacks provide newer kernel and X support for existing LTS releases, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack
Feb 25 05:52:10 <lotuspsychje>	jacekowski: a more easy tut, https://www.linuxcapable.com/how-to-install-hwe-kernel-on-ubuntu-linux/
Feb 25 05:52:13 <jacekowski>	it used to work
Feb 25 05:52:22 <jacekowski>	then i did an upgrade
Feb 25 05:52:43 <lotuspsychje>	its posible newer kernel versions get stuck modules jacekowski that happens
Feb 25 05:52:48 <jacekowski>	also, if i do modprobe amdgpu after it boots, driver loads fine
Feb 25 05:53:31 <lotuspsychje>	thats odd indeed
Feb 25 05:53:50 <jacekowski>	the only thing that i'm not sure about
Feb 25 05:54:00 <jacekowski>	this system boots via iscsi on various machines
Feb 25 05:54:04 <jacekowski>	some with novideo graphics
Feb 25 05:54:30 <jacekowski>	and i might have updated it on machine with novideo
Feb 25 05:57:10 <jacekowski>	hmmmmmmmmm
Feb 25 05:57:26 <jacekowski>	it did work with hew kernel
Feb 25 05:57:31 <lotuspsychje>	yay
Feb 25 05:58:03 <lotuspsychje>	iscsi is a server you playing on jacekowski ?
Feb 25 05:58:59 <jacekowski>	no, it's a desktop
Feb 25 05:59:23 <jacekowski>	but i'm using PXE + iscsi to boot it
Feb 25 05:59:29 <jacekowski>	sometimes
Feb 25 05:59:54 <lotuspsychje>	i see
Feb 25 06:00:15 <lotuspsychje>	so lets assume latest kernel 5.15 doesnt like your module jacekowski
Feb 25 06:00:43 <lotuspsychje>	jacekowski: if you want more proves, you could try booting a lower kernel 5.15 to see if you can reproduce
Feb 25 06:01:24 <jacekowski>	i've tried it with -94 and it was broken as well
Feb 25 06:02:09 <lotuspsychje>	hmm
Feb 25 06:02:27 <jacekowski>	it worked on whatever was available ~month ago
Feb 25 06:02:45 <lotuspsychje>	jacekowski: ok, then perhaps try the oldest of your 5.15 series

Feb 28 00:39:50 <PeGaSuS>	if  I try to boot fro the cloned disk, I go into the grub command line, directly. I don't seem to be able to mount the drive, no. the source disk works. I think it's EFI? the PC is different but same brand and almost same specs
Feb 28 00:40:06 <oerheks>	no, not efi, you can tell if you used efi
Feb 28 00:40:21 <oerheks>	update frub with the real UUID's
Feb 28 00:40:32 <PeGaSuS>	I definitely used GPT, that's a fact
Feb 28 00:40:39 <oerheks>	or grub
Feb 28 00:41:03 <PeGaSuS>	sorry, but I don't know how to do that
Feb 28 00:42:09 <oerheks>	'ubuntu show uuid update grub'

Feb 29 09:27:37 <brancher>	Hi! The mysql docs still show useradd over adduser... should I change ? useradd -M -N -g mysql -o -r -d datadir -s /bin/false -c "MySQL Server" -u 27 mysql
Feb 29 09:33:36 <ravage>	the ubuntu package installs that user for you
Feb 29 09:45:27 <brancher>	ravage there are people that do things manually for a reaon.
Feb 29 09:45:30 <brancher>	reason.
Feb 29 12:32:20 <realivanjx>	what is the issue called if suddenly my screen is freezing and a few seconds later it goes black and then a few seconds later it goes back on again (still freezing) and so on. this happens rarely but i have to force shutdown my laptop when it happens. my laptop's processor is ryzen 3 2200g. ubuntu 23.10
Feb 29 12:40:15 <oerheks>	videodriver, videomemory,..
Feb 29 12:49:36 <eqw>	When install ubuntu it allows to see so called "Full installer output". Is it available as a textfile?
Feb 29 12:54:25 <oerheks>	there is /var/log/dpkg log, and journalctrl
Feb 29 12:55:25 <ravage>	The installer log is in /var/log/installer on the installed system
Feb 29 12:56:07 <ravage>	During the live session it's /var/log
Feb 29 12:58:37 <eqw>	well that's not exactly what i see in "Full installer output" window
Feb 29 13:01:22 <oerheks>	you mean the gui ?
Feb 29 13:02:02 <eqw>	tui
Feb 29 13:03:13 <ravage>	curtin-install.log looks kind of exactly what the installer shows
Feb 29 13:08:39 <eqw>	not on my system
Feb 29 13:08:47 <eqw>	ubuntu server jammy
Feb 29 13:40:41 <Your_Dog>	Anyone know a clean way to remove logs on ubuntu? I just wanna do the barbaric way and rm -rf everything on var/logs
Feb 29 13:41:34 <oerheks>	no need, to, logrotate does that for you,, but if you want to fancy them
Feb 29 13:41:37 <oerheks>	https://betterstack.com/community/guides/logging/how-to-manage-log-files-with-logrotate-on-ubuntu-20-04/
Feb 29 13:42:50 <oerheks>	edit /etc/logrotate.conf and find  # keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
Feb 29 13:43:00 <oerheks>	set to 1, is safe
Feb 29 13:43:21 <Your_Dog>	oh
Feb 29 13:43:56 <Your_Dog>	sweet, imma rotate it for 1 week then
Feb 29 13:44:00 <Your_Dog>	to*
Feb 29 13:44:07 <oerheks>	also /etc/logrotate.d/ gives some logging
Feb 29 13:44:12 <oerheks>	configs&
Feb 29 13:48:09 <ogra_>	or just remove rsyslog altogether and stick with journald ... also removes redundancy
Feb 29 13:48:35 <ogra_>	(we're logging everything twice since the switch to systemd)
Feb 29 13:48:51 <oerheks>	is there a guide for that?
Feb 29 13:49:09 <ogra_>	apt purge rsyslog  ?
Feb 29 13:52:20 <oerheks>	if that stops and removes the service too, great
Feb 29 13:54:15 <ogra_>	it does ... it wont remove logs lying around in /var/log though ...
Feb 29 13:54:59 <ogra_>	and you want to keep logrotate around still ... since there might be apps diretly writing their own logs (i.e. apache) that you still want rotated
Feb 29 13:57:09 <ogra_>	but things like syslog, kern.log, boot.log, auth.log etc are really just duplicating whats in the journal anyway ...
Feb 29 13:59:07 <oerheks>	interesting, some parts i do no find in https://www.fosslinux.com/134983/customizing-or-disabling-system-logging-in-ubuntu.htm

Feb 29 16:24:15 <Guest5119>	hello
Feb 29 16:24:17 <Guest5119>	i'm new here
Feb 29 16:47:01 <Guest5119>	anyone up for a chat?
Feb 29 16:48:52 <tomreyn>	Guest5119: hi there. this channel's purpose is ubuntu support (see /topic). there are other channels, some of which are for chat.
Feb 29 16:57:23 <Guest5119>	tomreyn, oh ok, is there a place on this server to ask about irc specifically?
Feb 29 17:00:02 <tomreyn>	Guest5119: there's #libera on this irc network (consisting of multiples servers), which is primarily about the irc network, but you can often get help with using irc there, too.
Feb 29 17:00:12 <tomreyn>	!alis | Guest5119
Feb 29 17:00:12 <ubottu>	Guest5119: Alis is an IRC service to help you find channels. For help on using it, see «/msg Alis help list» or ask in #libera - Example usage: «/msg Alis list http»
Feb 29 17:00:37 <Guest5119>	alis?
Feb 29 17:00:42 <Guest5119>	what?
Feb 29 17:02:49 <Guest5119>	ubottu, what is alis? how is it a "service"? is it a website? a bot? a program?
Feb 29 17:04:08 <tomreyn>	Guest5119: i suggest you start in #libera for now.
Feb 29 17:10:44 <Ravisankar>	hi
Feb 29 17:11:46 <Ravisankar>	I created virtual machine using oracle vm box, and installed ubunut on it... but there is no user with sudo permision
Feb 29 17:11:57 <Ravisankar>	could any help me here?
Feb 29 17:13:01 <tomreyn>	Ravisankar: how did you install ubuntu there?
Feb 29 17:13:29 <Ravisankar>	@tomreyn: using oracle virtual box
Feb 29 17:14:17 <tomreyn>	Ravisankar: that's a virtualization software, not an ubuntu installation method
Feb 29 17:14:48 <Ravisankar>	using ubuntu iso
Feb 29 17:14:50 <plastikman>	If you used the wizard, then it would be vboxuser
Feb 29 17:15:03 <tomreyn>	did you download and install an ubuntu iso? which one?
Feb 29 17:15:18 <plastikman>	and AFAIK the default installed user will have sudo, but it will ask you the password when you enter it
Feb 29 17:15:49 <Ravisankar>	ubuntu 22 lts
Feb 29 17:16:23 <tomreyn>	!yy.mm
Feb 29 17:16:23 <ubottu>	Ubuntu version numbers are: YY.MM (YY=release year,MM=release month). Each year sees two releases, so just specifying YY is imprecise. See also https://www.ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle
Feb 29 17:16:49 <tomreyn>	there are ubuntu desktop, server, cloud images, and ubuntu core.
Feb 29 17:18:01 <Ravisankar>	@plastikman: the user name is ravivm and password is also the same.. but this user does not have sudo privilege
Feb 29 17:18:10 <Ravisankar>	@tomreyn: 22.04
Feb 29 17:19:17 <plastikman>	If this is a fresh install, just reinstall but dont use the vbox wizard
Feb 29 17:19:53 <plastikman>	you can break in with a live cd and add your user to the sudoers group but not sure its really worth doing so
Feb 29 17:20:41 <tomreyn>	recovery should also work for that
Feb 29 17:20:43 <Ravisankar>	i want to install it on virtual desktop
Feb 29 17:21:04 <Ravisankar>	@tomreyn: how to recover?
Feb 29 17:21:55 <tomreyn>	!recovery | Ravisankar
Feb 29 17:21:55 <ubottu>	Ravisankar: If your system fails to boot normally, it may be useful to boot it into recovery mode. For instructions, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode
Feb 29 17:23:51 <tomreyn>	boot to recovery menu, then use the "root shell" (i think that's what it's called) option (should be the last in the list). then press enter to login to the root shell and run    adduser ravivm sudo && exit
Feb 29 17:25:06 <Ravisankar>	i can't boot to recovery menu... it is not showing...
Feb 29 17:25:24 <Ravisankar>	i did holding shift key , esc key
Feb 29 17:25:42 <plastikman>	Ravisankar: this is a fresh install right?  Just reinstal inside virtualbox and dont use the unattended flag from the vbox wizard
Feb 29 17:26:08 <Ravisankar>	it quickly goes to user login
Feb 29 17:28:26 <Ravisankar>	if i try to install anything using software centre, it is asking for authentication as 'Administrator', but I have not set any password for the 'Administrator'
Feb 29 17:29:01 <tomreyn>	it should be asking for your users' password
Feb 29 17:29:16 <tomreyn>	you may have misread the message
Feb 29 17:34:38 <Ravisankar>	i will reintsall it, thank you all for your support
Feb 29 17:42:37 <andros_>	I can connect to ipv6 on my 22.04 server. everything seems to work, ipv6 is enabled and I have an ipv6 address, but no ping6 works. when I do traceroute6 www.google.com I get: Cannot send data: Operation not permitted
Feb 29 17:49:26 <nubuntu>	I need to customize a version of ubuntu to use at school. But in this new version there are 3 squashfs files (minimal, minimal.standard and minimal.standard.live) before I only modified the filesystem.squashfs. I'm not sure which one to modify the system now since it's so "divided". Would anyone have any documentation about this?
Feb 29 17:56:11 <tomreyn>	andros_: it appears that your user or system is not allowed to send icmp packets (try sudo?)
Feb 29 17:56:43 <tomreyn>	* icmpv6
Feb 29 18:00:50 <andros_>	tomreyn: I have already tried it as root. the problem is also that connections do not work, for example with add-apt-repository.
Feb 29 18:16:54 <andros_>	tomreyn: There is only one thing that is strange, there are two ipv6 addresses assigned, one is the one given by the hoster, the other one I don't know: fe80::aaa1:59ff:fe48:fcaa
Feb 29 18:17:09 <rfm>	andros_, that's not surprising since unlike v5 icmp is required to set up connections (for the mtu discovery.) The question is why icmp is blocked.  Is this a real machine you installed yourserlf, or a image on some vps/cloud service?
Feb 29 18:18:13 <rfm>	andros_, the fe80 addr is the link-local.  it's very very common to have multiple ipv6 addresses
Feb 29 18:24:17 <andros_>	rfm: it is a dedicated server the inital setup was done by the hoster, it worked for years only with ipv4. I have upgraded it a fews months agot to 22.04 from 20.04.
Feb 29 18:30:20 <rfm>	andros_,  I would suspect the hosting company has disabled ipv6, though I don't know if that results in the "operation not permitted"
Feb 29 18:31:32 <rfm>	andros_, you could look in /etc/sysctl.conf and /etc/sysctl.d/* for anything affecting ipv6
Feb 29 18:32:32 <andros_>	rfm: Normally ipv6 is part of the product
Feb 29 18:33:25 <rfm>	andros_, yes, and normally it works, so we don't have  a normal situation here
Feb 29 18:33:56 <rfm>	andros_,
Feb 29 18:36:03 <rfm>	andros_, this will check for the most usual way of disabling it: "grep '' /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/*/disable_ipv6", if any values are 1 instead of 0 it's been disabled
Feb 29 18:37:32 <andros_>	rfm: I have found a file in /etc/sysctl.d/ that comes from the hoster with a configuration for "ipv6 settings (no autoconfiguration)" with net.ipv6.conf.default.autoconf=0 and net.ipv6.conf.all.autoconf=0. But the ip addresses were apparently set up via networkd.
Feb 29 18:42:01 <manwhowouldbekin>	Greetings all! Could someone help me out with this? Anything I do with GPG on Ubuntu 23.10 results in something like this https://pastebin.com/fkQzCmfu Any idea how I can fix this and actully update the keys?
Feb 29 18:47:41 <plastikman>	andros_: do you have ufw or firewalld running?
Feb 29 18:47:49 <rfm>	andros_, I've never tried running without autoconf but if the link-local address is there it's pretty clear the interface has been configured. But this is a sign your hosting outfit has done something special with ipv6, and maybe you should be checking with them.
Feb 29 18:47:49 <plastikman>	s/firewalld/iptables/
Feb 29 18:48:33 <rfm>	plastikman, a firewall wouldn't result in the "operation not permitted" on the icmp send, it would just keep the packet from going anywhere...
Feb 29 18:48:39 <plastikman>	You say you can connect on ipv6, i assume that means you can ssh to the host on ipv6?  maybe you have egress rules the block it
Feb 29 18:48:52 <plastikman>	rfm yes it will  :)
Feb 29 18:49:35 <plastikman>	iptables and nftables will return those errors, all of my RHEL machines return that with firewalld enabled.
Feb 29 18:53:22 <plastikman>	https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2466916
Feb 29 18:54:14 <plastikman>	You can see from that forum, UFW will produce those messages.  I will bet that there is a UFW setting that is not allowing v6 connectivity
Feb 29 18:54:54 <andros_>	I have no firewall. I can't test to connect with ipv6 because I have no ipv6 at home.
Feb 29 18:55:29 <plastikman>	sudo iptables -nL
Feb 29 18:55:44 <plastikman>	and systemctl status ufw
Feb 29 18:57:31 <plastikman>	if that system has CIS benchmarks applied (any server AT MINIMUM should) it will have UFW enabled
Feb 29 19:01:05 <andros_>	iptable rules are empty and UFW is not installed.
Feb 29 19:05:20 <fweht>	is it recommended to start with the ubuntu server install for a minimal desktop install?  or is server extremly different from desktop?
Feb 29 19:08:01 <plastikman>	do you have a default route? ip -6 route show
Feb 29 19:09:02 <plastikman>	then can you try to ping6 the default route?
Feb 29 19:19:54 <plastikman>	fweht: sorry no idea.  I wouls assume its related to the installer, the packages shuold not be diff.  but i am not an expert
Feb 29 19:20:22 <fweht>	thanks plastikman !
Feb 29 19:20:31 <fweht>	ill just try
Feb 29 19:21:51 <rfm>	fweht, one big difference is starting with a server install will end up with net controlled by systemd-networkd instead of NetworkManager and administered by netplan instead of the gui settings...
Feb 29 19:22:22 <plastikman>	nice, i did not know that.
Feb 29 19:22:25 <fweht>	aah interesting thanks
Feb 29 19:22:31 <fweht>	i dont need gui
Feb 29 19:22:44 <fweht>	just nmcli
Feb 29 19:23:03 <rfm>	fweht, nmcli is NetworkManager too
Feb 29 19:23:04 <plastikman>	well nmcli is not sysremd-networkd
Feb 29 19:23:12 <fweht>	yes true
Feb 29 19:34:46 <andros_>	plastikman: Yes there is a default route for ipv6. But I can not ping6 it.Timeout.
Feb 29 19:43:00 <fweht>	rfm but i guess there is some cli tool for systemd-network as well?
Feb 29 19:44:22 <ioria>	networkctl
Feb 29 19:46:05 <plastikman>	andros_: that means that your gateway is wrong or not reachable
Feb 29 19:48:00 <andros_>	plastikman: But the gateway is fe80::1 as suggested in the Hetzner docs.
Feb 29 19:48:49 <oerheks>	can you pastbin your network setup?
Feb 29 19:53:48 <andros_>	oerheks: https://pastebin.com/jbVv6avg
Feb 29 19:58:09 <plastikman>	ip a s; ip -6 route show; ip -6 rule show all
Feb 29 19:58:54 <plastikman>	since ipconfig is depricated should use the "new" tools :)
Feb 29 20:00:22 <andros_>	plastikman: https://pastebin.com/n6yLtacj
Feb 29 20:22:08 <plastikman>	where is the documentation from your hosing provider?
Feb 29 20:26:15 <plastikman>	are you doing the setup in netplan?
Feb 29 20:26:17 <plastikman>	https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/primary-ips/primary-ip-configuration/
Feb 29 20:28:12 <andros_>	plastikman: this is my netplan config https://pastebin.com/rVNVSsx7
Feb 29 20:29:49 <plastikman>	that does not match the documenttion that is provided tho
Feb 29 20:33:05 <plastikman>	https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/net-config-debian-ubuntu/#main-ip-address
Feb 29 20:35:07 <andros_>	plastikman: But it looks generally correct to me. It should also work, right? After all, it is also from the hoster.
Feb 29 20:35:20 <plastikman>	not sure about the gateway6 part

Feb 29 20:36:09 <plastikman>	the gateway6 is the problem

Feb 29 20:52:26 <rfm>	andros_, when you changed away from gateway6, did you lose the nameservers: entries?
Feb 29 20:54:26 <andros_>	rfm: I had it confogured without nameserver entries as in the docs. But now I have added the nameserver entries from the old config but still no name resolution.
Feb 29 20:55:21 <plastikman>	andros_: dig google.com @1.1.1.1
Feb 29 20:56:35 <andros_>	plastikman: this works
Feb 29 20:57:17 <plastikman>	what is in /etc/resolv.conf

Feb 29 20:59:07 <andros_>	plastikman: There was a warning when I netplan apply WARNING:root:Cannot call Open vSwitch: ovsdb-server.service is not running.
Feb 29 20:59:25 <andros_>	plastikman: yes this works too.
Feb 29 21:00:09 <andros_>	plastikman: wait a second there is no answer section so it doen't work

Mar 01 01:59:41 -ChanServ-	[#ubuntu] Welcome to #ubuntu. This channel is logged. Use of this channel implies acceptance of terms at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/TermsOfService
Mar 01 05:13:12 <bcn_>	is there a good explainer on how netboot netinstalls changed as of jammy?
Mar 01 05:13:41 <ravage>	https://www.molnar-peter.hu/en/ubuntu-jammy-netinstall-pxe.html
Mar 01 05:19:15 <bcn_>	hmm. jammy is no longer in https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-server/daily-live/current/
Mar 01 05:19:31 <ravage>	get the release iso
Mar 01 05:20:19 <ravage>	but if yoi need a daily for any reason: https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-server/jammy/daily-live/current/
Mar 01 05:20:22 <bcn_>	I should probably pick up lunar while I'm at it
Mar 01 05:20:52 <ravage>	never installed a non LTS server
Mar 01 05:20:56 <ravage>	but have fun 🙂
Mar 01 05:21:38 <ravage>	i guess i would even prefer noble over lunar
Mar 01 05:24:16 <bcn_>	ravage: huh.  that same url pattern doesn't work for lunar
Mar 01 05:24:25 <bcn_>	lunar was after jammy right?
Mar 01 05:25:24 <ravage>	i dont think there are any official non-LTS server releases
Mar 01 05:25:51 <ravage>	could be wrong
Mar 01 05:26:32 <bcn_>	okay.... looking at this.... so preseed is gone, totally dead and gone and not used any more, right?
Mar 01 05:26:33 <ravage>	https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/lunar/ubuntu-23.04-live-server-amd64.iso
Mar 01 05:26:37 <ravage>	i was wrong
Mar 01 05:26:43 <ravage>	but 23.04 is EOL
Mar 01 05:26:47 <ravage>	so dont install it
Mar 01 05:27:20 <ravage>	preseed is no more
Mar 01 05:27:40 <ravage>	it is a horrible new autoinstall world now
Mar 01 05:29:19 <Ximo>	autoinstall is several times less horrible than preseed was
Mar 01 05:29:21 <bcn_>	dang.  so debian's still using pressed but canonical is not
Mar 01 05:29:41 <ravage>	the documentation is horrible
Mar 01 05:29:45 <bcn_>	mounting an iso file to do an install sounds like a step backward
Mar 01 05:30:00 <ravage>	you never know what is a cloud-init feature or specific to autoinstall
Mar 01 05:30:13 <ravage>	it all mixes together is a big mess
Mar 01 05:31:09 <ravage>	24.04 will have a mini iso and also offer a netboot tarball
Mar 01 05:31:10 <ravage>	https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-server/daily-live/pending/
Mar 01 05:31:41 <Ximo>	as a design philosophy i feel like all autoinstall (or even preseed) should do is lay down the OS, leave the rest to configuration management
Mar 01 05:31:42 <ravage>	https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-mini-iso/daily-live/current/
Mar 01 05:32:18 <ravage>	i think the noble mini iso also offer the install of jammy
Mar 01 05:32:25 <ravage>	but have not checked it in a while
Mar 01 05:33:56 <ravage>	it does
Mar 01 05:34:13 <ravage>	https://i.imgur.com/4qK9pTq.png
Mar 01 05:34:13 <rbox>	but the car can't go back too far
Mar 01 05:34:15 <rbox>	bbecause of the cable
Mar 01 05:34:23 <rbox>	oops, wrong channel, haha
Mar 01 05:34:50 <ravage>	wow the noble iso does not offer noble. thats funny
Mar 01 05:35:58 <ravage>	also it basically just downloads the whole ISO and mounts it. so you only save some time on booting it
Mar 01 05:46:45 <sergiu>	hi
Mar 01 05:46:58 <sergiu>	can i install ubuntu on laptop i5?
Mar 01 05:47:29 <rbox>	what is 'laptop i5'

Mar 01 05:53:45 <toddc>	!nvidia
Mar 01 05:53:45 <ubottu>	Drivers for Nvidia graphics cards: (A) No gaming/CAD/CUDA needed or legacy hardware? Use "nouveau" (open source, lacks many features). (B) Otherwise, "nvidia" (proprietary driver, fully featured). Install using "ubuntu-drivers" CLI or apt - not from nvidia.com.

Mar 01 06:05:04 <oscarmr>	in the past, some games have a launched binaries for linux, like a Unreal Tournament or Quake 3 Arena.

Mar 01 06:07:27 <sergiu>	bye \
Mar 01 06:11:29 <oscarmr>	Ximo, i the troll?
Mar 01 06:21:07 <bcn_>	casper says can't open sr0 mo medium found
Mar 01 06:22:01 <bcn_>	do I really ahve to mount an dee vee dee iso file to do a netboot ipxe netinstall of jammy?
Mar 01 08:00:17 <bcn_>	my server has a wlan chip.  do I need to tell curt/subiquity to ignore wlan?
Mar 01 08:04:06 <fweht>	whats the general rule of thumb for packages available both as snap and as apt? i currently dont use snap and i like how i only need one command to update everything.  but thats super important, i just wonder whats the best practice
Mar 01 08:09:04 <rfm>	fweht, there are a lot of considerations. one is snaps might be more up to date, for example firefox snaps are built by moz so the delay of having ubuntu devs build debs has goine away...
Mar 01 08:09:19 <fweht>	rfm: cool i see, then ill use snap!
Mar 01 08:09:27 <fweht>	what about flatpak?  its supported by ubuntu as well, right?
Mar 01 08:11:23 <rfm>	fweht, also some snaps are more available, for example the abraunegg ppa for onedrive doewn't yet support mantic (no reason why they should!) but the snap works just fine
Mar 01 08:12:33 <rfm>	fweht, flatpak does work on ubuntu, but I've never used one.  if an app I wanted to use came on flatpak but not snap or deb, I'd decide then...
Mar 01 08:12:50 <fweht>	rfm: thanks a lot for the infos!
Mar 01 08:13:05 <fweht>	ill just use snap
Mar 01 08:13:58 <fweht>	is this a problem of my installation or is copying / pasting from / into emacs not supported on ubuntu?
Mar 01 08:14:06 <fweht>	(i dont like emacs but i wanted to give it a try)
Mar 01 08:14:51 <rfm>	fweht, are you using a snap for emacs? snaps are "confined" so they usually can't get at files outside the home directory.
Mar 01 08:15:44 <rfm>	fweht, I use the repo/deb versions of emacs, they're new enough for me
Mar 01 08:15:47 <fweht>	rfm: haha no i havent installed snap yet but plan to use it for my next setup
Mar 01 08:16:16 <fweht>	what snaps are confined?  does that mean i cant use e.g. the terminal inside vscode to do sudo stuff?
Mar 01 08:16:26 <fweht>	i really like vscode terminal :D
Mar 01 08:17:01 <fweht>	plan to use ubuntu 24.04 server with a minimal gui and snap, just for fun and see how far i get
Mar 01 08:17:27 <bcn_>	is there a ubuntu channel that is dedicated to the installer environment?
Mar 01 08:18:49 <rfm>	fweht, don't understand what your problem is with emacs then.  don't use vscode, but if it's a confined snap (there are "classic" unconfined snaps)  then it just can't see things in the host root file system.
Mar 01 08:18:52 <tifosi>	hi folks - installing 20.04 LTS on my PC, installation procedure goes smoothly, upon reboot i just see a blinking cursor; i changed tty, edited grub config to disable quiet splash, rebooted, i see all the lines with greek "Ok" - zero sign of errors - but still just green blinking cursor; not sure what to do next?
Mar 01 08:19:04 <bcn_>	I'm trying to automate an ubuntu install with subiquity.  but the install fails and in "autoinstall config did not create needed bootloader partition". I'm modeling after 'Simple server' from https://www.molnar-peter.hu/en/ubuntu-jammy-netinstall-pxe.html
Mar 01 08:19:22 <bcn_>	their example used /dev/vda.  and I'm installing to real hardware /dev/sda so I changed vda to sda
Mar 01 08:19:58 <bcn_>	Homestly I'd prefer to be agnostic to the storage type available.  some systems have nvme for instance
Mar 01 08:20:43 <fweht>	rfm: thanks, the emacs thing is really not important.  i dont think ill use it much, its too far away from what im used to (vim or vscode)
Mar 01 08:22:28 <tifosi>	busy purging nvidia drivers and trying again
Mar 01 08:28:27 <vmelis>	Hi. I used this instructions (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019) 2 years ago to setup my current pc without any problems. Now I have tried the same instructions to setup a new pc but I keep getting an error. "Unable to install GRUB in /dev/nvme0n1. executing grub-install /dev/mnve0n1 failed. The hardware of the 2 pcs
Mar 01 08:28:28 <vmelis>	are identicall. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
Mar 01 09:27:15 <stenno>	good day, how can i export an environment variable in ubuntu 22.04, so that it gets set when i log in with ssh?
Mar 01 09:27:23 <stenno>	i wrote it in ~/.profile but it does not get set
Mar 01 09:27:42 <eawfaw>	try ~/.bashrc
Mar 01 09:28:52 <ogra_>	from "man ssh":
Mar 01 09:28:54 <ogra_>	     ~/.ssh/environment
Mar 01 09:28:54 <ogra_>	             Contains additional definitions for environment variables; see ENVIRONMENT, above.
Mar 01 09:29:01 <stenno>	what is ~/.profile for?
Mar 01 09:29:52 <stenno>	as opposed to ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile
Mar 01 09:31:12 <stenno>	why do some need EXPORT and some don't? is there any reason to it
Mar 01 09:31:34 <stenno>	or any method, so that i can get familiar with that, because for me that doesn't make sense in the slightest
Mar 01 09:32:23 <ogra_>	the ones prefixed with "bash" are only read by bash ... you might be using one of the gazillion other shells
Mar 01 09:32:46 <ogra_>	(zsh, ksh, fish ... or if you are crazy enough dash)
Mar 01 09:32:48 <stenno>	ah, don't need to use EXPORT for ~/.ssh/environment
Mar 01 09:32:53 <stenno>	50/50
Mar 01 09:33:01 <stenno>	sometimes you need ot use EXPORT, sometimes not
Mar 01 09:34:07 <stenno>	so i guess when i want to set an environment variable for a user, regardless of if they log in normally or via ssh
Mar 01 09:34:26 <stenno>	i have to read ~/.ssh/environment in ~/.profile
Mar 01 09:35:28 <stenno>	or i will just write it in several places
Mar 01 09:35:39 <stenno>	apparently logging in via ssh is something very exotic
Mar 01 09:37:29 <stenno>	i will just write it to /etc/environment (which doesn't need export)
Mar 01 09:50:40 <stenno>	writing it in ~/.bashrc apparently helped
Mar 01 09:50:44 <stenno>	it will forever be a mystery for me
Mar 01 09:50:53 <stenno>	(needed export)
Mar 01 10:01:48 <tifosi>	exit

Mar 01 14:03:13 <sybariten>	just because a package exists in apt, it doesnt necessarily exist in snap right?
Mar 01 14:04:22 <nsmolinski>	ls
Mar 01 14:05:54 <ioria>	sybariten, what's the problem ? the 'snap spoof' ?
Mar 01 14:07:11 <sybariten>	ioria: well i want to install a chat client, and therefore i wanted to check beforehand which versions i would get with apt vs snap. So i could get the latest of the two
Mar 01 14:07:25 <ioria>	i see
Mar 01 14:07:31 <sybariten>	but "snap info weechat" gave an error
Mar 01 14:08:28 <merzu>	sybariten: there is no snap version for weechat apparently
Mar 01 14:08:53 <ioria>	sybariten, maybw 'wechat' :þ
Mar 01 14:09:00 <merzu>	lol
Mar 01 14:09:35 <sybariten>	merzu: oh okay
Mar 01 14:09:48 <sybariten>	ioria: hehe completely different platform....  i have that one on my phone
Mar 01 14:11:34 <ioria>	ok
Mar 01 14:11:54 <ioria>	sybariten, what ver you need ?
Mar 01 14:12:23 <sybariten>	ioria: bah, nothign specific i suppose, just wanted as new of a version as possible.
Mar 01 14:12:46 <merzu>	sybariten: if you need latest weechat installed from APT, you need to add a repo: https://weechat.org/download/debian/#ubuntu_jammy
Mar 01 14:12:50 <ioria>	sybariten, 23.10 matic is weechat | 4.0.5-1
Mar 01 14:12:54 <sybariten>	I tend to prioritize an easy install procedure over having the most bleeding edge version of a software, so i think i will just go with whatever apt offers to me
Mar 01 14:13:30 <sybariten>	merzu: hm, how do these things work actually. I have never really understood the relation between ubuntu versions and sofware packages
Mar 01 14:15:02 <sybariten>	if I do lsb_release -r it says          Description:    Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
Mar 01 14:15:37 <sybariten>	Maybe this means that specific software is tested for this OS version, and no newer software will appear even if something is released?
Mar 01 14:16:14 <merzu>	sybariten: it means, that Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is two years old, and mostly all software are so that old also
Mar 01 14:16:42 <sybariten>	merzu: ok. i will simply not get a two months old software into this OS install
Mar 01 14:16:51 <elfranne>	Is there a way to specify limit apt options (under /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/) for a specific repo ? I have a repo that change name often, so I want to set "Acquire::AllowReleaseInfoChange" but only for that repo
Mar 01 14:17:21 <merzu>	sybariten: it is not about that some packages are unstable. I bilieve if you install weechat from differnt repo, you can't break your system. In the end, it is just a console app
Mar 01 14:19:20 <ioria>	sybariten, 24.04 will be here soon, and it will ship 4.1 ... maybe just wait a bit
Mar 01 14:20:03 <merzu>	ioria: not really a bit, probably 22.04 will be upgradable to 24.04 in the summer
Mar 01 14:20:10 <sybariten>	merzu: euh, i thought the idea was specifically this: that packages could be non-compliant with a specific version of the os?
Mar 01 14:20:47 <merzu>	sybariten: no, it will be ok, since this is official weechat repo for 22.04 ubuntu, so they verified that it should be installed correctly
Mar 01 14:20:59 <sybariten>	ALso, is 22.04 upgradable to , say, v23 already now? Is this a painful procedure? I talking about a headless VPS that i'm renting online
Mar 01 14:22:11 <ioria>	sybariten, you need to face and cope with possible issues
Mar 01 14:22:18 <merzu>	sybariten: if you need more recent Ubuntu, why have you installed LTS version.
Mar 01 14:22:35 <sybariten>	merzu: i dont quite understand that question
Mar 01 14:23:06 <oerheks>	22.04 will be upgradable with the 24..04.1 release
Mar 01 14:23:14 <ioria>	there was a period, not a q mark
Mar 01 14:23:28 <oerheks>	for a VPS, stick to LTS
Mar 01 14:23:31 <merzu>	oerheks: you'r right, at the first point release, as usually
Mar 01 14:23:57 <ioria>	fresh install then, better
Mar 01 14:24:36 <sybariten>	I just go with whatever is conidered sane, stable, easy, good practice
Mar 01 14:24:58 <sybariten>	but i donẗ wanna be sitting on a too old version if its advisable not to
Mar 01 14:25:14 <merzu>	sybariten: then you should be fine at your current system, just wait when it will propose you to upgrade
Mar 01 14:25:35 <ioria>	sybariten, the point is: some apps have ppa, flatpak, appimage etc. etc ver available ;others don't
Mar 01 14:25:41 <oerheks>	or go wild, and use the -d option

Mar 02 14:40:04 <warsoul>	i changed host name
Mar 02 14:40:10 <warsoul>	now im getting this error message

Mar 02 15:42:59 <ashafq>	Firefox snap on Ubuntu 22.04 does not open Downloads folder when I click "show-all-downloads"
Mar 02 15:43:12 <ashafq>	Is this a known issue? Am I missing any packages?
Mar 02 16:03:50 <Your_Dog>	ashafq: lemme try on a fresh ubuntu install, but iirc before i move back to non-snap (keepassxc reasons) i was able to open the download folder
Mar 02 16:12:18 <Your_Dog>	ashafq: is yours a fresh install? because I just tested mine, it works
Mar 02 16:20:17 <chico_>	ashafq: Show all downloads opens the firefox download library not the downloads folder. click the folder icon to the right of the download and should open downloads folder.
Mar 02 16:22:09 <ChristopheM>	Hi, where can I find more chat rooms or Lubuntu related forums ?
Mar 02 16:22:43 <Matthias1>	I was asking about this in #linux but wondered if someone here would know. I'm trying to install `libffi-dev`, but getting "no installation candidate"
Mar 02 16:23:12 <chico_>	lubuntu channel
Mar 02 16:23:22 <Matthias1>	I've tried apt update and apt upgrade, so it seems like there's something wrong with my package cache?
Mar 02 16:23:34 <Matthias1>	On focal LTS
Mar 02 16:24:12 <chico_>	Matthias1: I'm assuming that it's no longer available
Mar 02 16:25:04 <ravage>	it is still available in noble. also in focal
Mar 02 16:25:08 <ravage>	https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libffi-dev
Mar 02 16:25:10 <leftyfb>	Matthias1: please copy and paste this into your terminal:   ( uname -a  ; cat /etc/os-release ; apt-cache policy libffi-dev ; cat /etc/apt/sources.list ) | nc termbin.com 9999
Mar 02 16:27:07 <Matthias1>	https://termbin.com/ph2g
Mar 02 16:27:47 <leftyfb>	you don't have a single non-security repo enabled
Mar 02 16:27:56 <leftyfb>	why did you disable all of your repositories?
Mar 02 16:28:04 <leftyfb>	oh wait, you have universe
Mar 02 16:28:08 <Matthias1>	deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal universe ?
Mar 02 16:28:14 <ravage>	the package is in main
Mar 02 16:29:20 <Matthias1>	And I don't have main. That's great
Mar 02 16:29:37 <ravage>	backup that file and try https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ishad0w/788555191c7037e249a439542c53e170/raw/3822ba49241e6fd851ca1c1cbcc4d7e87382f484/sources.list
Mar 02 16:29:46 <ravage>	you can remove the last 2 lines
Mar 02 16:29:49 <leftyfb>	ooo, faster than me
Mar 02 16:30:03 <leftyfb>	https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/6sNFzHVFW9/
Mar 02 16:30:06 <leftyfb>	I usuall suggest that
Mar 02 16:30:09 <leftyfb>	usually*
Mar 02 16:30:23 <ravage>	it was just a quick google search 🙂
Mar 02 16:30:52 <Matthias1>	What if I comment out my current sources and just keep adding to the bottom lol
Mar 02 16:31:19 <ravage>	you already have old stuff in there that is commented
Mar 02 16:31:22 <leftyfb>	Matthias1: how about just doing away with your complete mess and just run from a working sources.list?
Mar 02 16:31:31 <ravage>	and it looks like you already lost control over ut
Mar 02 16:31:36 <ravage>	maybe use a fresh one
Mar 02 16:31:42 <Matthias1>	Yeah
Mar 02 16:32:03 <Your_Dog>	I agree, just start with a fresh one first and if you feel like it, start tweaking again from there
Mar 02 16:32:15 <Matthias1>	Apparently I botched it when upgrading from bionic
Mar 02 16:32:25 <leftyfb>	Matthias1: curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ishad0w/788555191c7037e249a439542c53e170/raw/3822ba49241e6fd851ca1c1cbcc4d7e87382f484/sources.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt update ; sudo apt full-upgrade
Mar 02 16:33:00 <leftyfb>	maybe replace that last ; with a &&
Mar 02 16:45:34 <Matthias1>	Got it working without any more issues. Thank you all
Mar 02 16:54:38 <Menzador>	You're welcome, but in all reality you shouldn't yeet an arbitrary GitHub link into your sources list
Mar 02 16:56:19 <ravage>	it is not arbitrary
Mar 02 17:00:17 <Menzador>	I mean, *I* know where the content is coming from, but something that important should always come from the Ubuntu Web site. ESPECIALLY since Focal (20.04 LTS) is still a supported release for the main flavor
Mar 02 17:01:01 <ravage>	the url was sent to him before to check. the content is not that complex. it clearly shows only official servers
Mar 02 17:03:06 <Menzador>	You can also find a copy in /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list
Mar 02 17:03:16 <Menzador>	Even on a Live image
Mar 02 17:03:46 <ravage>	no idea when that gets updated
Mar 02 17:03:47 <Menzador>	You copy it to /etc/apt/sources.list and then change the distribution whichever is correct
Mar 02 17:03:57 <ravage>	on my noble device it still shows lunar
Mar 02 17:03:58 <Menzador>	*to whichever is correct
Mar 02 17:04:35 <ravage>	and changing sources the right way was exactly why he was here
Mar 02 17:04:56 <ravage>	and struggled with it
Mar 02 17:05:05 <Menzador>	But you DON'T have to find that from an unofficial source. It's best practice to use the official source to begin with.
Mar 02 17:05:48 <ravage>	giving support here without code to paste from a paste bin is almost impossible
Mar 02 17:05:51 <ravage>	but please try it
Mar 02 17:07:43 <ravage>	also in this case any packages not signed correctly would be denied by ap
Mar 02 17:07:53 <ravage>	apt. so i dont see the big security risk
Mar 02 17:08:33 <Menzador>	Would they? What if a GPG key outside the official repos was trusted and signed by the user without examination
Mar 02 17:08:51 <ravage>	it was not
Mar 02 17:09:00 <Menzador>	And that was lucky
Mar 02 17:09:07 <ravage>	not by any of the volonteers
Mar 02 17:13:32 <Menzador>	I am done discussing this issue. My point is, if something that can be found within your installation (I do this all the time with, e.g., /etc/skel/.bashrc for resetting my .bashrc file) it's ALWAYS preferable over some arbitrary text file. Good day to you.
Mar 02 17:53:06 <chico_>	Updating to 23.10, On boot blue screen ERROR Verification failed: (0x1A) Security violation
Mar 02 17:54:36 <chico_>	Continue Boot has lock on screen Security Boot Fail
Mar 02 17:56:54 <chico_>	which to allow as trusted? bootx64.efi, mmx64.efi or grubx64.efi to reinstall from usb
Mar 02 17:58:31 <jeremy31>	chico_: Disable Secure Boot in BIOS
Mar 02 17:59:22 <jeremy31>	Then install all updates and see if it will boot with Secure Boot then
Mar 02 18:02:32 <chico_>	jeremy31: UEFI Firmware Settings says Secure Boot Mode: Custom.....Erase Secure Boot Setting:....Select an UEFI file as trusted for executing:.....Restore Secure Boot:...Factory Default
Mar 02 18:03:26 <chico_>	also grub commandline says need to load kernel first
Mar 02 18:05:07 <jeremy31>	For Secure Boot I thought there was a shimx64.efi
Mar 02 18:09:15 <chico_>	jeremy31: Under Ubuntu option ther is (grubx64.efi, shimx64.efi and mmx64.efi) under boot there is ()Bootx64.efi, fbx64.efi and mmx64.efi). Choosing shimx64.efi under ubuntu it says The boot description exists
Mar 02 18:10:19 <jeremy31>	under boot would be for the USB I think, try mmx64.efi
Mar 02 18:12:55 <chico_>	It still does the same. Takes me to MOK Management
Mar 02 18:14:15 <chico_>	Then pops up the security boot fail screen
Mar 02 18:16:26 <chico_>	When choosing memory test it says error: file '/BOOT/ubuntu_mcptlo@/memtest86+x64.efi' not found.
Mar 02 18:16:41 <jeremy31>	chico_: Does this have Windows installed?
Mar 02 18:17:15 <jeremy31>	The memtest only works on Legacy/BIOS boot
Mar 02 18:17:20 <chico_>	No. was Ubuntu 22.04 upgrading to Ubuntu 23.10
Mar 02 18:18:46 <chico_>	when choosing to boot Ubuntu 23.10 it says /BOOT/vmlinuz-6.5.0-21-generic not found
Mar 02 18:19:37 <chico_>	you need to load the kernel first
Mar 02 18:21:41 <jeremy31>	Any other kernel installed?
Mar 02 18:22:13 <jeremy31>	Try using Grub Menu advanced options for ubuntu
Mar 02 18:24:16 <chico_>	jeremy31: Many thanks!! Was able to get secure boot disabled and now reinstalling ubuntu 21.10 from usb.
Mar 02 18:24:49 <jeremy31>	chico_: can you boot the install and update it?
Mar 02 18:25:33 <jeremy31>	Or just use the ISO on USB, chroot into the install and install updates
Mar 02 18:25:50 <geirha>	hopefully you mean 23.10 and not 21.10
Mar 02 18:26:52 <chico_>	21.10 was the original, I upgraded to 22.04 fine. When attempting to upgrade to 23.10 had issue with secure boot
Mar 02 18:28:40 <chico_>	Uefi dbx firmware update issue?
Mar 02 18:29:34 <jeremy31>	chico_: That is my bet
Mar 02 18:31:16 <chico_>	jeremy31: going to do a quick reinstall...updates and not update the uefi dbx and verify
Mar 02 18:35:39 <jeremy31>	chico_: The UEFI update must already be in the computer or there wouldn't have been a boot issue with the ISO
Mar 02 18:36:40 <chico_>	yes, I updated the vs 83 to 371

Mar 03 08:42:21 <root>	software
Mar 03 08:44:16 <lotuspsychje>	Fenhl: htop and journalctl -f might give some light perhaps?
Mar 03 08:45:26 <Fenhl>	htop is showing CPU near 0, RAM at around 50%, and each of the `perf` processes has a child process in `D` state
Mar 03 08:45:43 <Fenhl>	will run journalctl as well on the next attempt
Mar 03 08:46:49 <lotuspsychje>	Fenhl: did you pick enough ram/hd for your VM?
Mar 03 08:47:13 <Fenhl>	there's definitely plenty of disk space
Mar 03 08:47:28 <Fenhl>	didn't seem like RAM was an issue either
Mar 03 08:48:13 <Fenhl>	I'm currently running the benchmarking script again and it's still working normally, and htop is showing RAM hovering around 15 out of 30G
Mar 03 13:02:06 <frib>	How can I fix this issue? The following packages have unmet dependencies:
Mar 03 13:02:06 <frib>	 libgphoto2-6:i386 : Depends: libgd3:i386 (>= 2.1.0~alpha~) but it is not going to be installed
Mar 03 13:02:33 <lotuspsychje>	frib: unmet dependencys mostly occur due external ppa's conflict
Mar 03 13:02:51 <lotuspsychje>	frib: you got some external ppa's on your system?
Mar 03 13:03:25 <frib>	maybe 2 that are necessary yes
Mar 03 13:03:41 <frib>	one for my school and one for work
Mar 03 13:04:29 <lotuspsychje>	frib: best to ppa purge them, bring back your sources to the original ubuntu ones to resolve your conflict
Mar 03 13:04:34 <lotuspsychje>	!ppapurge
Mar 03 13:04:34 <ubottu>	To disable a PPA from your sources and revert your packages back to default Ubuntu packages, install ppa-purge and use the command: « sudo ppa-purge ppa:<repository-name>/<subdirectory> » – For more information, see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html
Mar 03 13:05:03 <frib>	I can't do that. I wonder if this problem is related to multiarch though?
Mar 03 13:06:14 <lotuspsychje>	frib: feel free to !paste your sources.list with the volunteers, they can have a look for you
Mar 03 13:06:29 <frib>	volunteers?
Mar 03 13:07:02 <lotuspsychje>	frib: yes, this channel is backed by volunteers of the ubuntu community
Mar 03 13:08:02 <webchat52>	Hi everyone, some apt upgrade on March 1st included nvidia (470.223.02-0ubuntu0.22.04.1, 470.239.06-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) and now my graphic card / monitors don't work properly. Is this the place to describe my issue (I'm new here) ?
Mar 03 13:09:10 <frib>	https://pastebin.com/fPcMcBDn
Mar 03 13:09:51 <frib>	that's my source list and this is everything in sources.list.d: deb https://gt-cs6200.github.io/ppa ./

Mar 03 13:30:35 <frib>	maybe I just needded sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
Mar 03 13:30:35 <frib>	 ?
Mar 03 13:34:27 <PeGaSuS>	frib: what if you change the line "deb https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu/ jammy main" to be "deb [arch=amd64] https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu/ jammy main" instead? assuming you're not running ARM or something
Mar 03 13:37:02 <PeGaSuS>	also the URL on "<frib> that's my source list and this is everything in sources.list.d: deb https://gt-cs6200.github.io/ppa ./" doesn't work

Mar 03 13:46:34 <PeGaSuS>	most likely, yes. but Sundays are always more slow
Mar 03 13:49:56 <webchat52>	Basically, I don't manage to re-install the Additional Drivers 'NVIDIA driver metapackage from nvidia-driver-470'.
Mar 03 13:51:18 <webchat52>	Everything worked fine for months. Then on March 1st after a reboot, the graphic card/monitors didn't work properly ('unknown display', very low resolution). I investigated a bit a saw :

Mar 03 13:53:26 <webchat52>	ok sorry. Extract from apt history log : https://dpaste.com/48EMMYYP4
Mar 03 13:54:48 <webchat52>	Logs of my tries to reinstall the nvidia drivers : https://dpaste.com/G3ZZ7GJT7
Mar 03 13:56:12 <webchat52>	The "dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of nvidia-driver-470" blocks me, I don't know what to do.
Mar 03 13:58:21 <tomreyn>	webchat52: lines 194 and 195 are relevant. the nvidia kernel module failed to build, and there's a separate logfile saying why
Mar 03 13:59:27 <webchat52>	Here's the make.log : https://dpaste.com/8B9EFJ676
Mar 03 14:03:58 <tomreyn>	webchat52: can you install package gcc-12, then run   export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-12     and try again?
Mar 03 14:08:05 <tomreyn>	!info gcc jammy
Mar 03 14:08:07 <ubottu>	gcc (4:11.2.0-1ubuntu1, jammy): GNU C compiler. In component main, is optional. Built by gcc-defaults. Size 5 kB / 50 kB
Mar 03 14:08:21 <webchat52>	Thks tomreyn, seems to work, at least the apt install https://dpaste.com/C5674WBZ7
Mar 03 14:08:32 <webchat52>	Now I reboot and come back here
Mar 03 14:09:11 <tomreyn>	looks like the kernel modules built fine this time around. good luck
Mar 03 14:16:12 <webchat52>	Just rebooted : the graphic card / monitors don't work properly, although the reinstallation of nvidia proprietary driver seemed to work.
Mar 03 14:17:05 <tomreyn>	webchat52: this may help - does it install additional packages?    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt full-upgrade
Mar 03 14:17:36 <tomreyn>	which kernel version is running now?    cat /proc/version
Mar 03 14:18:05 <webchat52>	In "Software & Updates"/"Additional Drivers", I fall back to "Using X.Org X --Nouveau display driver from xserver-xorg-video-nouveau (open source)", but this driver doesn't support the full resolution of my 34' screen...
Mar 03 14:19:04 <ravage>	in my experience purging all packages that include nvidia in the name and then just install the nvidia-driver-$VERSION that wotks for your card usually fixes stuff
Mar 03 14:19:39 <ravage>	had thr problem of the module not loading or working a few times after an upgrade already
Mar 03 14:19:40 <webchat52>	sudo apt update / upgrade / full-upgrade : reports nothing strange, 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Mar 03 14:20:47 <webchat52>	kernel version : 6.5.0-14 now ?? https://dpaste.com/3B586Z2NW
Mar 03 14:22:25 <tomreyn>	maybe ravage's suggestion is the easiest approach
Mar 03 14:23:30 <ravage>	i did not follow the whole conversation. did we already find the latest version that supports his card?
Mar 03 14:23:46 <webchat52>	ravage , how should I purge all packages that include nvidia in the name ? (am not proficient) Should do this from a boot in safe mode ?
Mar 03 14:24:25 <ravage>	you can get a list with: dpkg -l|grep 'ii '|grep nvidia|xargs
Mar 03 14:24:45 <ravage>	if that looks reasonable you can add that to: sudo apt remove --purge [list of packages]
Mar 03 14:27:53 <tomreyn>	ravage: we did not. webchat52 runs jammy on amd64. installing pending updates via apt resulted in nvidia-dkms-470 failing to build the kernel module for then running kernel version 6.5.0-14-generic: https://dpaste.com/G3ZZ7GJT7 https://dpaste.com/8B9EFJ676 - because the dkms module build script expects to use gcc-12 or newer (which provides the "unrecognized command-line option ‘-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero’"), but jammy defaults to gcc-11
Mar 03 14:28:48 <tomreyn>	"we did not" was in response to "did we already find the latest version that supports his card?". i do not know which hardware it is. but driver variant 470 was apparently working previously.
Mar 03 14:29:06 <webchat52>	I get this list https://dpaste.com/9TFRCPK4J. Please could you confirm what I should try is "sudo apt remove --purge linux-objects-nvidia-470-6.5.0-14-generic linux-objects-nvidia-470-6.5.0-21-generic linux-objects-nvidia-470-6.5.0-21-generic linux-objects-nvidia-470-6.5.0-21-generic" ?
Mar 03 14:29:23 <webchat52>	(thanks so much guys for your help, sorry for the stupid questions)
Mar 03 14:29:23 <tomreyn>	(note: i think i read somewhere that webchat52 is using wayland)
Mar 03 14:29:41 <ravage>	oh that is a bad idea with nvidia
Mar 03 14:29:55 <ravage>	make sure to switch to xorg if possible on the login screen
Mar 03 14:30:01 <webchat52>	I don't think I'm using wayland. How can I check ?
Mar 03 14:30:26 <ravage>	after you did click on your username on the login screen there is a gear icon
Mar 03 14:30:32 <ravage>	you can choose the session type there
Mar 03 14:30:36 <ravage>	let me check the list
Mar 03 14:30:56 <ravage>	yes purge that
Mar 03 14:31:02 <ravage>	and let me know when its done
Mar 03 14:31:09 <tomreyn>	echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
Mar 03 14:31:47 <webchat52>	Arrhhh yes it says 'wayland'....
Mar 03 14:32:14 <tomreyn>	bbl, good luck!
Mar 03 14:32:14 <ravage>	ok so after we install the driver try the xorg session after the reboot
Mar 03 14:32:24 <ravage>	\o tomreyn 🙂
Mar 03 14:32:59 <ravage>	after you removed all packages try: sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470
Mar 03 14:34:02 <webchat52>	ravage, purge done https://dpaste.com/3C35CB4N7
Mar 03 14:35:50 <ravage>	ok. install the driver
Mar 03 14:36:58 <webchat52>	Unfortunately, installation of the driver went bad : https://dpaste.com/DFT73CTNN
Mar 03 14:37:50 <webchat52>	I'm trying again, with 'export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-12' before the apt install
Mar 03 14:38:19 <oerheks>	some issues with a 2nd monitor can be fixed with pulling hdmi out and insert again.
Mar 03 14:39:59 <webchat52>	@@oerheks, yes I started with that but issues remained
Mar 03 14:40:04 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Mar 03 14:40:15 <ravage>	did it install now with gcc12?
Mar 03 14:40:23 <oerheks>	webchat52, oke.
Mar 03 14:41:37 <webchat52>	Even with export gcc 12, it doesn't work ... https://dpaste.com/GHWTKE7CR
Mar 03 14:42:11 <ravage>	which card do you have there?
Mar 03 14:42:50 <webchat52>	nvidia build make.log : https://dpaste.com/9MZS28KWY
Mar 03 14:43:33 <webchat52>	My card is model    : GK208B [GeForce GT 710]
Mar 03 14:43:46 <ravage>	still used gcc 11 for the build
Mar 03 14:44:52 <webchat52>	"export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-12" was not the right thing to do before running apt install ?
Mar 03 14:44:55 <ravage>	does "update-alternatives --list gcc" output anything?
Mar 03 14:45:32 <webchat52>	It says : update-alternatives: error: no alternatives for gcc
Mar 03 14:46:43 <ravage>	and "gcc --version" shows 11?
Mar 03 14:47:19 <ioria>	webchat52, usually in these cases, i purge all and i restart from a clean slate
Mar 03 14:47:34 <ravage>	also does "gcc-12 --version" output something too?
Mar 03 14:47:47 <ravage>	ioria: we are doing that right now
Mar 03 14:47:54 <ravage>	or trying to
Mar 03 14:48:34 <webchat52>	Here's gcc versions : https://dpaste.com/6JSQGDWCV
Mar 03 14:49:06 <ioria>	ok, take care of '2 not fully installed' and 'previous failure.  Setting up libx11-6:i386'
Mar 03 14:49:54 <ravage>	thet should be fixed when we get the nvidia packages installed i hope
Mar 03 14:49:58 <ravage>	*that
Mar 03 14:50:08 <ravage>	webchat52: do "sudo ln -s -f /usr/bin/gcc-12 /usr/bin/gcc"
Mar 03 14:50:20 <ravage>	and see if your gcc output now shows version 12
Mar 03 14:51:13 <webchat52>	I did the 'ln' and now indeed gcc --version says '12'. Shall I apt install nvidia-470 again ?
Mar 03 14:51:19 <ravage>	yes
Mar 03 14:53:46 <webchat52>	apt install of nvidia 470 seem to have completed successfully
Mar 03 14:53:56 <ravage>	ok
Mar 03 14:54:18 <webchat52>	Shall I reboot, and to the gear icon thing to select X i.o. wayland ?
Mar 03 14:54:26 <ravage>	what does "sudo modprobe nvidia" show?
Mar 03 14:54:50 <webchat52>	Arrhhh : modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'nvidia': No such device
Mar 03 14:55:48 <ioria>	webchat52, can we see the output of apt install ?
Mar 03 14:55:54 <ravage>	try "sudo apt install --reinstall nvidia-driver-470-dkms"
Mar 03 14:56:08 <ravage>	yes the output would be helpful too
Mar 03 14:56:47 <webchat52>	Ok I'll try this sudo reinstall. Here's info about hardware as seen : https://dpaste.com/9UP3KLEHH
Mar 03 14:57:37 <ravage>	the ubuntu drivers command should in theory also install everything you need
Mar 03 14:57:51 <ravage>	as long as we get the module built and loaded we should be fine
Mar 03 14:58:14 <webchat52>	Here's the log of the last install . I'm now launching the reinstall
Mar 03 14:58:18 <webchat52>	https://dpaste.com/34VSF9QLS
Mar 03 14:59:00 <webchat52>	Hummm it says 'E: Unable to locate package nvidia-driver-470-dkms' Should I remove '-dkms' ?
Mar 03 14:59:35 <ravage>	ah no
Mar 03 14:59:38 <ravage>	should be ok
Mar 03 14:59:49 <ravage>	also it looks like it actually built the module
Mar 03 15:00:18 <ravage>	is there a nvidia.ko flle in /lib/modules/6.5.0-14-generic/updates/dkms/ ?
Mar 03 15:00:27 <ravage>	if yes try: sudo insmod /lib/modules/6.5.0-14-generic/updates/dkms/nvidia.ko
Mar 03 15:02:03 <webchat52>	In in /lib/modules/6.5.0-14-generic/updates/dkms/ I have 5 .ko files, one of which is nvidia.ko, but they are 10minutes old
Mar 03 15:02:20 <lotuspsychje>	there seem to be a few bugs around so it seems, bug #2049571
Mar 03 15:02:21 -ubottu/#ubuntu-	Bug 2049571 in nvidia-graphics-drivers-470 (Ubuntu) "module fails to compile nvidia-470.223.02 for kernel 6.5.0-14-generic (x86_64)" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2049571

Mar 03 15:02:25 <ravage>	try to load it
Mar 03 15:02:38 <frib>	if I have a corrupt superblock on my raid 5 array, does that mean my data is unrecoverable?

Mar 03 15:02:53 <lotuspsychje>	few reports on latest
Mar 03 15:03:17 <webchat52>	ravage, how can I load it exactly ?
Mar 03 15:03:20 <frib>	my BIOS was not auto booting my OS disk with ubuntu so I used BIOS auto recovery (said the GPT header was corrupt), now my raid array is dead
Mar 03 15:03:34 <ravage>	webchat52: sudo insmod /lib/modules/6.5.0-14-generic/updates/dkms/nvidia.ko

Mar 03 15:04:24 <ravage>	huh. but /lib/modules/6.5.0-14-generic/updates/dkms/nvidia.ko exists?
Mar 03 15:05:21 <webchat52>	Yes it does https://dpaste.com/HCENHMUE6
Mar 03 15:05:43 <ravage>	can you show the last lines of: sudo dmesg
Mar 03 15:05:53 <ravage>	that look relevant to loading the module
Mar 03 15:06:45 <webchat52>	Last lines are https://dpaste.com/G4H4XZ6ZG
Mar 03 15:07:12 <ravage>	oh ok
Mar 03 15:07:19 <ravage>	a reboot may just fix that
Mar 03 15:07:31 <ravage>	try it and come back 🙂
Mar 03 15:07:58 <ravage>	also if you get to the login do the gear thing
Mar 03 15:08:25 <webchat52>	Ok I reboot, thanks so much ravage for your help
Mar 03 15:10:09 <lotuspsychje>	crosses fingers
Mar 03 15:11:24 <webchat52>	Just rebooted and everything is back to normal !! my 34' screen 3440x1440 is properly detected and used ! Thank you so much guys, especially ravage
Mar 03 15:11:33 <ravage>	\o/
Mar 03 15:11:39 <ravage>	great
Mar 03 15:11:44 <lotuspsychje>	!cookie | ravage
Mar 03 15:11:45 <ubottu>	ravage: Wow! You're such a great helper, you deserve a cookie!
Mar 03 15:11:52 <ravage>	nom nom
Mar 03 15:12:11 <webchat52>	Though, I didn't find the gear icon thing to avoid wayland. Will google to learn how to do this exactly.
Mar 03 15:12:13 <oerheks>	!yay
Mar 03 15:12:14 <ubottu>	Glad you made it! :-)
Mar 03 15:12:53 <lotuspsychje>	wayland + nvidia is still a work in progress webchat52
Mar 03 15:14:07 <ravage>	as long as your system works its fine
Mar 03 15:14:17 <ravage>	but i would not recommend wayland with nvidia 🙂
Mar 03 15:14:29 <ravage>	it may even auto switch to xorg
Mar 03 15:14:41 <ravage>	but im not sure. you can check the command again
Mar 03 15:14:59 <ravage>	echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
Mar 03 15:26:13 <militantorc>	does depmod usually take some time
Mar 03 15:30:52 <webchat52>	(I had to do a break) yes, $XDG_SESSION_TYPE now says X11
Mar 03 15:32:11 <webchat52>	Am a bit worried by the 'sudo ln -s -f /usr/bin/gcc-12 /usr/bin/gcc' that I did a few minutes ago. Any unwanted future side effect ? should I revert this ?
Mar 03 15:33:08 <webchat52>	Not sure I understood the 'cookie' things in the last posts, but if i can do something to show my reconnaissance, i'll comply eagerly
Mar 03 15:43:07 <ravage>	It should not affect your normal system operations 
Mar 03 15:43:22 <ravage>	And I hope future updates will just work this way

Mar 04 08:34:41 <Your_Dog>	k4k0: yes, since 23.04 is non LTS
Mar 04 08:35:38 <Your_Dog>	Also 23.04 was EOL'd since last January
Mar 04 08:35:43 <k4k0>	Should I update or is it better to wait for the LTS version? I heard that there is time to update, otherwise I won't be able to do it anymore
Mar 04 08:35:44 <k4k0>	hm
Mar 04 08:36:05 <Your_Dog>	Hmmmh right
Mar 04 08:36:35 <k4k0>	New release '23.10' available.
Mar 04 08:37:14 <Your_Dog>	24.04 is gonna be release a month after now but as for your question if you should pick 23.10 or the upcoming LTS it depends on you.
Mar 04 08:37:16 <k4k0>	I should update but would I be able to update after 23.04 to the LTS version?
Mar 04 08:38:24 <Your_Dog>	LTS means longer security updates but not much application updates, you have a much longer window for upgrading versions but you wont always get the latest software version. If you're happy with that, LTS is a good choice
Mar 04 08:38:27 <k4k0>	23.04 for version 24.04 it is possible even without updating to version 23.10
Mar 04 08:39:59 <k4k0>	?
Mar 04 08:40:20 <Your_Dog>	You can't skip versions im afraid
Mar 04 08:40:31 <Your_Dog>	so 23.04 to 23.10 to 24.04
Mar 04 08:41:38 <k4k0>	hm
Mar 04 08:42:02 <k4k0>	So I'll try to update
Mar 04 08:42:06 *	k4k0 shrug
Mar 04 08:47:51 <PeGaSuS>	you can jump to the next LTS
Mar 04 08:48:30 <k4k0>	too late, I've already started updating
Mar 04 08:48:31 <k4k0>	;x
Mar 04 08:48:42 <PeGaSuS>	you don't necessarily need to go through the "interim" releases
Mar 04 08:48:50 <k4k0>	23.10 is minotaur oO
Mar 04 08:49:41 <PeGaSuS>	it's an "interim" release, that'd be supported for 9 months
Mar 04 08:50:12 <k4k0>	hm
Mar 04 08:50:47 <PeGaSuS>	there are two types of releases inside Ubuntu: the well known LTS and the Interim: https://releases.ubuntu.com/
Mar 04 08:52:15 <PeGaSuS>	which means that you can safely jump from Ubuntu 22.04 to 24.04 without any issues and that's the default on Ubuntu
Mar 04 08:53:01 <k4k0>	humm
Mar 04 09:57:47 <Your_Dog>	PeGaSuS: really? i didnt know u can just upgrade from a prior interim version to LTS. Last time I remember you cant jump from 21.04 to 22.04
Mar 04 10:11:57 <asan>	HI I am trying to update from ubuntu 18 to 20. do-release-upgrade says install all available updates. Whereas apt upgrade says "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded."
Mar 04 10:15:42 <PeGaSuS>	Your_Dog: 21.04 was an interim
Mar 04 10:15:56 <Your_Dog>	yes
Mar 04 10:16:05 <Your_Dog>	k4k0 was asking 23.04 to 24.04
Mar 04 10:16:06 <PeGaSuS>	there, yes, I'm afraid you can't jump directly to an LTS
Mar 04 10:16:12 <Your_Dog>	ah
Mar 04 10:16:28 <Your_Dog>	darn it, you got me excited there
Mar 04 10:17:03 <asan>	Please help. How do I jump from 18 to the next LTS>
Mar 04 10:17:41 <PeGaSuS>	!eol
Mar 04 10:17:42 <ubottu>	End-Of-Life is when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop. Make sure to update Ubuntu before it goes EOL so you get updates promptly for newly-discovered security vulnerabilities. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOL and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more info. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
Mar 04 10:18:57 <PeGaSuS>	asan: Ubuntu 18.04 is EOL since last year. follow the last link of the ubottu message
Mar 04 10:19:12 <PeGaSuS>	so you can upgrade successfully to 22.04
Mar 04 10:19:43 <PeGaSuS>	20.04 will be EOL next year, so I strongly advise to update/upgrade to 22.04
Mar 04 10:22:48 <asan>	thanks PeGaSuS
Mar 04 10:32:51 <asan>	PeGaSuS those instructions did not work for me. even the support tool for upgrade did not work
Mar 04 10:35:38 <PeGaSuS>	you mean that `sudo apt update` says that there aren't any updates?
Mar 04 10:36:36 <PeGaSuS>	also, if ALL the updates are installed you need to reboot before trying `sudo do-release-upgrade`
Mar 04 10:36:47 <PeGaSuS>	otherwise Ubuntu won't update
Mar 04 10:37:27 <morgan-hp>	looking at lshw and I want to know if my laptop will do a 1080 external screen. I have a HP ProBook 455 G3 (X9T93UT#ABA)  - VGA port.
Mar 04 10:40:07 <asan>	PeGaSuS https://dpaste.com/5KKA927AA
Mar 04 10:41:11 <zniavre>	sudo inxi -Gxxxx will give you all you want to know about graphics
Mar 04 10:44:10 <PeGaSuS>	asan: what's the output of `sudo apt list --upgradable` ?
Mar 04 10:45:31 <asan90>	PeGaSuS code/stable 1.87.0-1709078641 amd64 [upgradable from: 1.76.2-1678817801]
Mar 04 10:45:32 <asan90>	N: There are 103 additional versions. Please use the '-a' switch to see them.
Mar 04 10:45:41 <asan90>	should I remove it ???
Mar 04 10:46:08 <asan90>	I have removed it
Mar 04 10:46:11 <PeGaSuS>	asan90: try `sudo apt install code`
Mar 04 10:46:46 <PeGaSuS>	you could just force the upgrade of the package
Mar 04 10:47:02 <asan90>	I removed it. Will install later. rebooting now.
Mar 04 10:47:13 <PeGaSuS>	now, usually you need to reboot the machine so then you can `sudo do-release-upgrade`
Mar 04 10:48:45 <asan90>	PeGaSuS it worked. thanks
Mar 04 10:49:04 <PeGaSuS>	asan90: you're welcome!
Mar 04 10:49:11 <asan90>	tyvm
Mar 04 10:50:05 <PeGaSuS>	always check for packages that aren't updated with `sudo apt list --upgradable`. if any, you can force the upgrade with `sudo apt install <package name>`.
Mar 04 10:50:38 <PeGaSuS>	then, you *alwways* need to reboot your machine before upgrading the OS
Mar 04 11:54:27 <antval>	hello
Mar 04 11:54:47 <antval>	how do i download apps like example roblox or steam
Mar 04 12:09:53 <whiskey76>	sudo apt install steam ...that's one way.
Mar 04 14:56:35 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Mar 04 15:37:11 <test_>	EXIT
Mar 04 15:54:12 <fweht>	any idea how i can make my path variable accessible by vscode resp. its extensions?
Mar 04 18:01:57 <nazrin>	hi
Mar 04 18:18:51 <jafa>	noble-server will no longer install (fails installing grub) and existing installs fail to apt update attempting to configure grub-efi-amd64-signed... what is the best way to discuss?
Mar 04 18:19:20 <lotuspsychje>	!next | jafa
Mar 04 18:19:20 <ubottu>	jafa: Noble Numbat is the codename for Ubuntu 24.04. For technical support, see #ubuntu-next. For testing and QA feedback and help, see #ubuntu-quality.
Mar 04 18:20:23 <jafa>	thanks
Mar 04 19:34:31 <Some_Person>	I think I made a big mistake. I had an autosaved scan in simple-scan that was a bit over half of a very long book. Now it seems to be gone. Is there any way to retrieve it? IDK where it stores autosaves
Mar 04 19:35:00 <Some_Person>	If I lose it, that is countless hours of work over the course of months gone
Mar 04 19:35:21 <d050>	probably gone forever im ngl
Mar 04 19:35:26 <Some_Person>	D:
Mar 04 19:36:02 <Some_Person>	god damnit
Mar 04 19:36:03 <leftyfb>	you took on a multi-month project and relied on an autosave feature without backups?
Mar 04 19:36:40 <Some_Person>	Maybe I was lucky but I managed to successfully scan several volumes of a series this way
Mar 04 19:36:44 <d050>	ye, did you not save manually at all?
Mar 04 19:37:14 <Some_Person>	I didn't :(
Mar 04 19:37:18 <d050>	also uh, how can i change and customize my colors and stuff?
Mar 04 19:37:31 <d050>	i just got done installing linux on my old laptop so im kinda new
Mar 04 19:37:53 <d050>	@Some_Person use this as a learning moment lol
Mar 04 19:38:02 <d050>	save your work always
Mar 04 19:38:11 <leftyfb>	d050: what release and flavor are you running?
Mar 04 19:38:17 <Some_Person>	It's a 502 page book and I had scanned up to page 251. And it's due back on the 19th :(
Mar 04 19:38:28 <d050>	lubuntu, latest
Mar 04 19:38:44 <Some_Person>	and I'm using a flatbed and having to put a heavy object on top of the book to get it to scan cleanly
Mar 04 19:38:47 <d050>	laptop is a pos. 2 gb of ram and a cpu from 2008
Mar 04 19:38:49 <Some_Person>	so it's a big pain in the butt
Mar 04 19:39:17 <Some_Person>	I need to find a better tool to do this, because it's obvious now that simple-scan is insufficient
Mar 04 19:39:21 <leftyfb>	Some_Person: now you have incentive to do it right this time :)
Mar 04 19:39:26 <leftyfb>	uh
Mar 04 19:39:48 <leftyfb>	Some_Person: simple scan is just fine. You need to save the files you want to keep
Mar 04 19:40:00 <d050>	Some_Person yknow just save your work next time :')
Mar 04 19:40:08 <leftyfb>	leaving them in some cache is never the answer
Mar 04 19:40:10 <Some_Person>	leftyfb: For such a long book, I need it to keep the file names in order. It can't restart numbering every time I go back to scan
Mar 04 19:40:19 <Some_Person>	simple-scan is incapable of this
Mar 04 19:41:20 <leftyfb>	why not buy the digital version of the book? I can't imagine is costs more than months of your time
Mar 04 19:42:12 <d050>	Some_Person try zlib?
Mar 04 19:42:22 <Some_Person>	leftyfb: lol, because no such thing exists!
Mar 04 19:42:31 <Some_Person>	it's an out of print series from the 1990s
Mar 04 19:43:43 <leftyfb>	d050: zlib(c) is a compression library. Nothing to do with scanning documents
Mar 04 19:44:45 <d050>	leftyfb Im aware, but I meant finding the book on there instead of scanning it yourself
Mar 04 19:49:41 <Some_Person>	I need a tool that can scan files into a collection of sorts. I need to be able to view each scan after making it. I need to be able to discard bad scans. And importantly, I need to be able to append to this collection. And this needs to be saved in a better way than this stupid autosave crap
Mar 04 19:49:59 <Some_Person>	Any suggestions?
Mar 04 19:51:21 <Some_Person>	I also don't want the tool to process the scan in any way. I just want the data from the scanner dumped to a PNG file or similar
Mar 04 19:51:45 <leftyfb>	"Save Document to File". Button at the top with a little down arrow
Mar 04 19:52:11 <Some_Person>	leftyfb: Yes. And then when I open it again, it creates a brand new collection with no continuity with anything scanned before
Mar 04 19:52:15 <Some_Person>	you see the problem?
Mar 04 19:53:18 <leftyfb>	Some_Person: you're doing the scanning. Just name things sequentially
Mar 04 19:53:38 <d050>	Some_Person use adobe scan, it has a preset specifically for books
Mar 04 19:53:44 <tomreyn>	d050: there's #lubuntu for lubuntu (desktop) specific questions
Mar 04 19:54:19 <Some_Person>	d050: Um... does that even exist for Linux?
Mar 04 19:54:21 <JanC>	I'm sure if there is an autosave then it's saved somewhere?
Mar 04 19:55:05 <leftyfb>	Adobe scan is a mobile app
Mar 04 19:55:08 <Some_Person>	JanC: It does. But it only seems to use this feature if the application is closed ungracefully, which admittedly is a dumb thing to rely on
Mar 04 19:55:20 <Some_Person>	lol at scanning a book with a mobile app, that would produce awful results
Mar 04 19:55:51 <d050>	tomreyn alright, thanks
Mar 04 19:56:37 <Some_Person>	I mean it's probably fine for something where quality doesn't matter and you just need the information, but that's not what I'm aiming for here. I'm taking 600 dpi scans with a flatbed because it's the best way I have to do it
Mar 04 19:57:50 <d050>	you might like the results
Mar 04 19:57:52 <d050>	just try it
Mar 04 19:57:55 <d050>	its free anyways
Mar 04 20:00:11 <Some_Person>	Just did. It looks exactly like I expected. Geometry issues because there's no way to get a book to lay flat on top of a surface. And the text is far less clear because obviously the smartphone camera is nowhere near the quality of a 600 dpi scan
Mar 04 20:00:26 <Some_Person>	I mean, it's readable, but pretty crap for archival work
Mar 04 20:00:33 <d050>	welp...
Mar 04 20:00:57 <d050>	time to find an app that has the feature set you want on linux
Mar 04 20:00:58 <d050>	:D
Mar 04 20:03:05 <JanC>	maybe script your own "tool" that scans, shows the scan, allows you to accept or deny the scan, repeat that until the scan is right, then loops to scan the next page   :)
Mar 04 20:05:58 <plastikman>	Why not just cut the binding off then feed the pages through?  that will accomplish the task of digitizing the pages and avoid weird angle problems
Mar 04 20:06:26 <JanC>	with a library book...?
Mar 04 20:06:37 *	JanC thinks they won't be happy
Mar 04 20:06:49 <plastikman>	Also, not sure this is a ubuntu problem :)
Mar 04 20:07:06 <plastikman>	feels like piracy with extra steps
Mar 04 20:07:31 <Some_Person>	I can't take the binding off a library book
Mar 04 20:08:29 <tykling>	you can but they frown upon it
Mar 04 20:09:04 <plastikman>	Not with that attitude.  Anyway, again, not sure this is a ubuntu specific problem.  as the issue you are having will exist across all platforms
Mar 04 20:10:30 <Some_Person>	I mean, it's just a question of needing a scanner program that keeps track of things scanned in a persistent way. simple-scan doesn't do this apart from its autosave feature, which as I learned today is extremely brittle
Mar 04 20:10:33 <plastikman>	the guy that runs the techtangents YT channel has a scanner that can do edgeless book scans, maybe check his video out and try to find his exact scanner model.  he is a Linux user so obviously has it all woeking
Mar 04 20:11:13 <Some_Person>	I mean... it doesn't really matter what scanner I use if the software doesn't do what I need
Mar 04 20:11:14 <leftyfb>	"simple" scan
Mar 04 20:11:20 <JanC>	it seems like Simple Scan allows you to run a script to "postprocess" the scans; such scripts should be able to able to save the files in a known location also?
Mar 04 20:11:54 <Some_Person>	I doubt that would discard the file if I delete it within simple-scan though
Mar 04 20:12:51 <JanC>	you can discard them manually afterwards, but at least you would have a copy of all scans  :)
Mar 04 20:13:06 <Some_Person>	and I discard frequently enough that this would be a major PITA
Mar 04 20:13:49 <Some_Person>	I'm scanning a 10 volume series here, and I'm on volume 5. Even small time savings during the scan process add up quickly here
Mar 04 20:13:57 <JanC>	you use the "Multiple Pages From Flatbed" option?
Mar 04 20:14:18 <Some_Person>	No, because that unfortunately just causes it to scan over and over continuously
Mar 04 20:15:01 <JanC>	I don't have a scanner, so I can't really test anything
Mar 04 20:15:15 <Some_Person>	while I need time to open scanner, remove heavy object, pick up book, turn page, replace book, replace heavy object, and close scanner
Mar 04 20:17:07 <JanC>	oh, it doesn't wait for a keypress or anything?
Mar 04 20:17:19 <Some_Person>	It's stupid enough not to do that
Mar 04 20:18:04 <Some_Person>	I think the option is intended for scanners with a document feeder
Mar 04 20:18:23 <JanC>	did you also try the other scanner software in Ubuntu?
Mar 04 20:18:32 <Some_Person>	which one? I'm asking for suggestions here
Mar 04 20:23:24 <plastikman>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mOLXOGxWMs&t=276s
Mar 04 20:23:50 <plastikman>	looks like this dood uses xsane which is NOT ideal.
Mar 04 20:24:11 <JanC>	you will have to test them yourself, as i said I don't have a scanner...  :)
Mar 04 20:26:06 <JanC>	if you know scripting you could play with scanimage/xscanimage maybe
Mar 04 20:28:37 <JanC>	maybe gscanpdf is an option also
Mar 04 20:28:48 <JanC>	gscan2pdf

Mar 05 08:11:57 <dumbledoor>	What does `apt install *` do? Will it download every single package listed in the official repositories? What will be the total size of it? Who does this benefit?
Mar 05 08:22:26 <CosmicDJ>	dumbledoor: no it will not, my guess: your shell will expand * to all the files/dirs in the current directory
Mar 05 08:22:53 <dumbledoor>	If * is escaped, then what?
Mar 05 08:23:31 <dumbledoor>	I did so, and my screen was immediately filled with Note, selecting 'some-package-name' for glob '*' lines

Mar 05 14:49:59 <noone>	asalamu alaykum
Mar 05 14:50:29 <noone>	why
Mar 05 14:52:24 <Guest3894>	hi all
Mar 05 14:52:37 <Guest3894>	i often can't rename folders and file
Mar 05 14:53:41 <Guest3894>	but if i cut and paste on desktop i can to do this and if i reduce the characters of the name of files or folders, after i can cut and paste them in the original folder on the external hd
Mar 05 14:54:07 <Guest3894>	is there a limit of lenght for characters in a path of folders or files in an external hd?
Mar 05 14:54:17 <bn_work>	hi, should fsck normally show output if it's "doing something"?  or is this output indicative that the machine is hung? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/JXurEBkb/dmesg.log  PS:  kernel = 5.10.13-x86_64
Mar 05 14:55:30 <ogra_>	Guest3894, depends on the filesystem used on the external drives ... fat/vfat surely has some lenght limits ... dos even more (8+3)
Mar 05 14:56:11 <Guest3894>	ntfs
Mar 05 14:56:21 <Guest3894>	ogra_
Mar 05 14:56:40 <Guest3894>	Offspring great band:-)  i like them
Mar 05 14:56:42 <ogra_>	that shouldnt have lenght limits but probably permission ones
Mar 05 14:57:20 <jongsta>	is it a requirement to have port 80 open outbound for a machine to use apt?
Mar 05 14:57:36 <jongsta>	i have 443 open and thought it might be sufficient but doesn't appear to be, at least not out of the box
Mar 05 15:02:48 <MartinTux007>	hi thobias
Mar 05 15:06:04 <MartinTux007>	thobias was tut sich?
Mar 05 15:12:38 <Guest49>	Hi all - looking for some advice
Mar 05 15:12:39 <Guest49>	I'm trying to install Ubuntu Studio on a Lenovo laptop and getting stuck.  I've manually created a new partition in the free space on the disk and I was hoping to install the OS there but I can't b/c the 'create' button is greyed out !
Mar 05 15:12:39 <Guest49>	To make matters more complicated I can't use the existing partition as the laptop is running windose 10 and for some reason the disk is showing as full when there are no files on it at all to speak of.  Google tells me this is a common issue with this OS
Mar 05 15:12:40 <Guest49>	I've tried everything I can think of but can't seem to get past this point
Mar 05 15:12:40 <Guest49>	Any ideas?
Mar 05 16:39:49 <magga>	ioria: i treid that, but i didnt work :o i ended up power off and coming back. gonna try it again next time it happens.
Mar 05 16:39:51 <magga>	it*
Mar 05 16:40:10 <ioria>	ok

Mar 06 03:32:17 <Rockwood>	hi
Mar 06 03:32:56 <Rockwood>	I am using wsl 2 with ubuntu 22.04
Mar 06 03:33:46 <Rockwood>	the problem is, I have to start the all services manually of distro
Mar 06 03:34:10 <rbox>	sounds like you want r eal liniux
Mar 06 03:34:16 <rbox>	real linux*
Mar 06 03:35:08 <Rockwood>	my SSD was crashed and I reinstall the wsl2 before it was very fine.
Mar 06 03:35:39 <sarnold>	Rockwood: maybe this systemd=true  line in wsl.conf? https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/systemd-support-is-now-available-in-wsl/
Mar 06 03:36:03 <Rockwood>	this is time i initialize the wsl via Vscode.
Mar 06 03:37:58 <Rockwood>	sarnold, https://dpaste.org/MQpxB
Mar 06 03:42:53 <sarnold>	Rockwood: and /etc/wsl.conf ?
Mar 06 03:43:04 <Rockwood>	sarnold, https://dpaste.org/brJBX  nothing like wsl.conf in this
Mar 06 03:44:27 <Rockwood>	I am looking in distro's etc folder.
Mar 06 03:46:04 <Rockwood>	should I create it manually?
Mar 06 03:46:39 <sarnold>	Rockwood: I'm not sure :/ on the one hand, this post does say to put those lines in that file, on the other hand, this post was written 1.5 years ago and might not be relevant to wsl of today :(
Mar 06 03:46:50 <sarnold>	at least it's easy to undo if it doesn't help
Mar 06 03:47:16 <Rockwood>	hmm
Mar 06 03:47:50 <Rockwood>	means uninstall the better option?
Mar 06 03:48:18 <Rockwood>	s/uninstall/uninstall is
Mar 06 03:49:23 <sarnold>	no, just that if this change doesn't do anything, it's easy enough to sudo rm /etc/wsl.conf and try the next thing :)
Mar 06 03:53:45 <Rockwood>	sarnold, I think it's works.
Mar 06 03:55:20 <Rockwood>	sarnold, Thanks a lots. it's works not.
Mar 06 04:02:46 <sarnold>	Rockwood: woo! thanks for reporting back :)
Mar 06 04:05:02 <Rockwood>	After add that file I shutdown and started wsl, it's working till now.

Mar 06 07:34:01 <yziquel75>	Hi. What upgrade path is there from jammy to mantic ?
Mar 06 07:35:33 <lotuspsychje>	yziquel75: you always need to jump to the next release first, 22.04==>22.10
Mar 06 07:35:50 <lotuspsychje>	but 22.10 is eol
Mar 06 07:36:18 <lotuspsychje>	yziquel75: so if you want 23.10, best to fresh install

Mar 06 09:59:04 <geirha>	:w
Mar 06 10:11:05 <yziquel>	lotuspsychje thanks. I guess I'll follow the 22.04 -> 22.10 -> 23.04 -> 23.10 path.
Mar 06 10:37:49 <yziquel>	Is managed upgrade jammy -> lunar possible ? or must I do jammy -> kinetic -> lunar in two steps ?
Mar 06 10:48:08 <geirha>	why not wait until 24.04 is released? You can go straight from 22.04 to 24.04
Mar 06 10:55:06 <CosmicDJ>	or, you know, just run do-release-upgrade and try the 23.04 noble beta?
Mar 06 11:04:27 <ahh_>	g
Mar 06 11:23:55 <lotuspsychje>	CosmicDJ: 23.04 is not noble
Mar 06 11:24:36 <DocMors>	and it's alömost eol
Mar 06 11:25:09 <lotuspsychje>	DocMors: 23.04 is already eol
Mar 06 11:25:40 <DocMors>	lotuspsychje, mea culpa of course it is
Mar 06 11:25:45 <yziquel>	geirha because there is only ONE thing I need: zfs 2.2. so I go for mantic.
Mar 06 11:26:08 <yziquel>	geirha because there is only ONE thing I need: zfs 2.2. so I go for mantic.
Mar 06 11:28:13 <yziquel>	I'm wondering. When one has a ubuntu pro account, how does one make dist-upgrades and get the account synced with the upgrade ?
Mar 06 11:33:29 <supesdupes>	I'm a bit confused on the difference between a gnome-shell theme and a GTK4 theme. How does the default theme for ubuntu, yaru, manage to look consistent across 4 different GTK toolkits (4 if we were to count libadwaita)?
Mar 06 11:39:34 <yziquel>	and the dist-upgrade did not update my kernel, because if oem repos. I need help.
Mar 06 11:43:16 <watson>	Hello, I'm new, and wanted to ask What's the purpose of this chat ?
Mar 06 11:45:02 <jeremy31>	watson: Official Ubuntu Support Channel
Mar 06 11:45:24 <watson>	Ok thanks
Mar 06 11:46:46 <DocMors>	does anyone know whether 24.04 will hatch with FDE?
Mar 06 11:47:39 <yziquel>	how do you ensure ubuntu pro is kept up to date with jammy -> lunar -> mantic upgrades ?
Mar 06 11:48:08 <yziquel>	Because the apt sources of ubuntu pro are not changing, and I don't know where I should find info as to how to amend them.
Mar 06 12:32:47 <david_>	hello
Mar 06 12:34:19 <whiskey76>	\o
Mar 06 12:41:37 <yziquel>	Is there a way for apt to show which kernel image provides a given version of the zfs kernel module ?

Mar 06 22:20:23 <sarnold>	it sure looks like the *important* error probably scrolled off screen :(
Mar 06 22:20:32 <sarnold>	try the safe mode boot option?
Mar 06 22:20:45 <EriC^^>	older kernel perhaps using grub?
Mar 06 22:22:57 <plastikman>	Sounds to me like there is a missing initramfs or some other driver. try to boot with a recovery kernel as others have states

Mar 07 13:30:05 <younder>	Did you 'hear' anything? python programmer?
Mar 07 13:31:42 <stenno>	listening to 0.0.0.0 is.. pragmatic
Mar 07 13:38:17 <younder>	Look a like that old code challenge where you where you write a echo protocol server that can handle at least 5 clients. Well a first poke at it..
Mar 07 13:41:45 <stenno>	my first python program i ever wrote was a socket server and client
Mar 07 13:41:53 <stenno>	still was in school then so it was around 2003 or so
Mar 07 13:42:09 <stenno>	coming from C++, it was really amazing
Mar 07 13:42:25 <stenno>	in python you could just do things without having to spend 200 SLOC to declare a connection or w/e

Mar 07 14:47:35 <sem>	I have already taken the precaution of creating a new user who will only log into kubuntu and never log into lubuntu
Mar 07 14:51:30 <BluesKaj>	hi sem
Mar 07 14:52:11 <sem>	hey! First thing I am websearching during this install: what does kubuntu use enfc for, and is it ok that it is insecure
Mar 07 14:52:26 <sem>	i know its spelled differently but I forget what it was
Mar 07 14:53:58 <sem>	i wish i remembered what it was called lol.. clicked through too quick
Mar 07 15:00:40 <sem>	now i am making sure to install sudo apt install plasma-workspace-wayland

Mar 07 16:33:19 <plastikman>	I dont see why not, but i cant say for sure.
Mar 07 16:33:50 <plastikman>	why not boot to a live cd, copy the data off the drive then attemt the re-install.

Mar 07 19:04:33 <szstr>	How to uh hmm do bluetooth through command line? connect then get an aymaj?
Mar 07 19:05:17 <szstr>	or wait uh connect then send audio iconed thing

Mar 07 19:23:30 <oerheks>	the trust part is hardly to find in any manual
Mar 07 19:24:07 <oerheks>	i use bluez, to connect, and then use the normal gui thingy
Mar 07 19:52:36 <atreo>	people, i am trying to write a script that auto sets up my ubuntu environment   (how can i from the terminal change the distro settings)  like turn off bluetooth, add keyboard shortcuts, add a profile picture etc...   where are these settings saved?
Mar 07 19:53:28 <leftyfb>	atreo: gsettings if you're running gnome
Mar 07 19:54:20 <atreo>	leftyfb: is it under ./config  ?
Mar 07 19:54:38 <leftyfb>	atreo: it's a tool, not a configuration file
Mar 07 19:56:02 <atreo>	leftyfb: you miss understood what i am trying to do,   i am trying to perform these settings changes from the terminal  (so i can save it into a script)
Mar 07 19:57:33 <leftyfb>	atreo: gsettings is a command line tool that will do exactly what you're looking for
Mar 07 19:57:40 <atreo>	leftyfb: oh
Mar 07 19:57:47 <atreo>	hmmm ok,   let me try to read about it
Mar 07 19:59:07 <atreo>	leftyfb: i can't seem to understand the manual page,    how can i add keyboard shortcuts using gsettings?
Mar 07 20:00:18 <atreo>	it seems to be talking about key strokes
Mar 07 20:02:27 <leftyfb>	keyboard shortcuts are a 2 part process
Mar 07 20:03:22 <leftyfb>	gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys custom-keybindings "['/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/']"
Mar 07 20:03:53 <leftyfb>	that's part 1
Mar 07 20:04:04 <leftyfb>	then defining the details of the custom sortuct
Mar 07 20:04:06 <leftyfb>	shortcut*
Mar 07 20:04:13 <leftyfb>	    - gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ name "nautilus"
Mar 07 20:04:14 <leftyfb>	    - gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ command "nautilus"
Mar 07 20:04:14 <leftyfb>	    - gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ binding "<Super>e"
Mar 07 20:04:33 <atreo>	leftyfb: ohhh   ok i think i see how this works
Mar 07 20:04:48 <atreo>	ok let me try to understand what you just wrote     give me 5 minutes :-)
Mar 07 20:05:18 <leftyfb>	atreo: if you add another shortcut, you need to run the 1st command again but append the 2nd custom shortcut (custom1)
Mar 07 20:05:35 <ghost>	hi
Mar 07 20:07:49 <atreo>	leftyfb: ok how do i findout what keyboard shortcuts i already have?    so i can reverse engineer the commands you just wrote
Mar 07 20:08:53 <leftyfb>	gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys custom-keybindings
Mar 07 20:09:58 <atreo>	leftyfb: i see
Mar 07 20:11:04 <atreo>	i see i have three shortcuts (as expected)  nice    custom0 custom1 custom2
Mar 07 20:11:12 <atreo>	hwo do i print their content?
Mar 07 20:12:18 <leftyfb>	gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ name
Mar 07 20:12:22 <leftyfb>	command and binding
Mar 07 20:13:57 <atreo>	leftyfb: woow  there was no way i could have figured this out myself
Mar 07 20:14:01 <atreo>	ok let me take notes
Mar 07 20:19:48 <Guest38>	does anyone have experience with this LUKS Encryption guide for Ubuntu ? <LINK> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019 </LINK>
Mar 07 20:21:08 <Guest38>	after following this guide step by step I and rebooting I boot into ubuntu without GUI
Mar 07 20:22:01 <atreo>	leftyfb: when i run the commands the previous one gets deleted, i am confused
Mar 07 20:22:33 <atreo>	leftyfb: this is my script:  https://paste.debian.net/1309804/
Mar 07 20:24:27 <leftyfb>	atreo: I explained that to you. You need to append the new shortcuts
Mar 07 20:24:39 <atreo>	leftyfb: oh
Mar 07 20:25:20 <atreo>	leftyfb: what is the append flag?
Mar 07 20:26:15 <atreo>	oh wait
Mar 07 20:26:17 <leftyfb>	gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys custom-keybindings "['/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/'], etc, etc, etc"
Mar 07 20:26:22 <atreo>	you mean   "['/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/'], , , "
Mar 07 20:26:25 <atreo>	ohhhhhh ok i get it
Mar 07 20:26:30 <leftyfb>	you define that first
Mar 07 20:27:55 <atreo>	leftyfb: it works    wow this is amazing !!!! :-)
Mar 07 20:28:36 <leftyfb>	atreo: btw, look into ansible. That's how I setup my ubuntu environment, install all packages, configure everything and restore from backup
Mar 07 20:29:23 <atreo>	leftyfb: interesting, it is a program that you install or is it within ubuntu itself?
Mar 07 20:29:41 <leftyfb>	atreo: sudo apt install ansible
Mar 07 20:29:46 <atreo>	leftyfb: ok
Mar 07 20:30:36 <atreo>	leftyfb: but i want to stick with gsettings    how do i know how to configure the rest of the settings?  like Region & Langauge    and adding a user picture etc...    where are you getting/reading this complex information from?
Mar 07 20:30:47 <leftyfb>	atreo: ansible will use gsettings
Mar 07 20:32:06 <leftyfb>	atreo: dconf and dconf-editor are good tools to navigate and edit(not recommended) all the settings
Mar 07 20:32:23 <atreo>	i see
Mar 07 20:32:46 <younder>	ansible is a program written in python. It is a provisioner. It install software based on scripts. Unlike shellscripts it is designed to enure that everything is just installed one so that if you run the script again and fix a mistake the stuff that was ok gets skipped and the stuff you corrected runs again (indepotent)
Mar 07 20:34:12 <younder>	There are many others like it puppet, chef, saltstack..
Mar 07 20:37:32 <atreo>	leftyfb: i like this basic control of it in gsettings     how did you know the commands?   for example   how can i figure out the schema for (Region & Langauge)?
Mar 07 20:39:01 <leftyfb>	atreo: sudo update-locale LANG=$new_language
Mar 07 20:39:29 <atreo>	leftyfb: oh no, i don't use my local lanuage and format, because it is screwed up   i used the UK one
Mar 07 20:40:07 <leftyfb>	atreo: you asked how you set your language. That's how
Mar 07 20:40:14 <atreo>	oh
Mar 07 20:40:16 <leftyfb>	for timezone: timedatectl set-timezone $timezone
Mar 07 20:40:26 <leftyfb>	with sudo
Mar 07 20:40:29 <atreo>	i see
Mar 07 20:42:15 <atreo>	leftyfb: how do i find out what is my current  (update-locale)  settings?
Mar 07 20:43:07 <atreo>	since langauge is LAN   what is format?    FOR? FORM? FORMAT?
Mar 07 20:43:16 <atreo>	*LANG
Mar 07 20:44:38 <atreo>	leftyfb: its ok i figured it out
Mar 07 20:50:19 <atreo>	leftyfb: ok how about appearance settings scheme?  to change it from light to dark, where is that schema?
Mar 07 20:52:22 <ravage>	gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme
Mar 07 20:53:51 <atreo>	ravage: leftyfb   i am getting the hang of it       gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Yaru-dark"    right?
Mar 07 20:55:11 <ravage>	yes. or for a specific accent color Yaru-blue-dark
Mar 07 20:55:34 <atreo>	ravage: nice
Mar 07 20:55:58 <atreo>	ravage: ok    here is an important question     gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.notifications KEY    how do i know what are all the available keys are?
Mar 07 21:01:15 <atreo>	ravage: its ok   i fiured it out    list-keys
Mar 07 21:02:21 <bprompt>	atreo: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11164/how-do-i-browse-for-available-gsettings-options
Mar 07 21:02:33 <atreo>	bprompt:    thanks :-)
Mar 07 21:02:38 <bprompt>	np
Mar 07 21:03:04 <atreo>	this is exciting   i am slowly scripting my ubuntu enviroment  so i can be up and running automatically    NIIIICE
Mar 07 21:20:43 <atreo>	ravage: leftyfb in the nautilus there is a list-view   but i cannot find how to setup (Expandible forlders in list view)
Mar 07 21:32:49 <chives>	Anyone familiar with the terminals in linux?  I'm wondering if i can start one for screen that when it terminates so does the terminal?
Mar 07 21:34:34 <chives>	so that if i detach screen remotely i dont have extra sessions
Mar 07 21:36:17 <tomreyn>	you can write and install an xdg desktop file which runs gnu screen and executes it in a terminal emulator
Mar 07 21:54:53 <Square>	This is probably an easy question. I have a second partition set up. But, it seems i need to access (as in clicking it) it in nautilus/filemanager every time i restart my computer for Steam being able to see/discover it.
Mar 07 21:55:22 <Square>	s/being/to be/
Mar 07 21:55:23 <oerheks>	put it in fstab?
Mar 07 21:55:33 <oerheks>	with proper permissions for steam
Mar 07 21:55:50 <Square>	hmm.. not that i can remember. Never used fstab
Mar 07 21:55:54 <oerheks>	https://askubuntu.com/questions/1489018/grant-steam-snap-access-to-second-hard-drive
Mar 07 21:56:02 <Square>	thanks
Mar 07 21:57:15 <oerheks>	Steam snap should have the removable drive permission by default.
Mar 07 21:57:27 <oerheks>	see settings > applications > steam
Mar 07 21:57:46 <Square>	okok. There was no mention of this mount in fstab, so maybe that's it
Mar 07 21:57:55 <oerheks>	maybe one bit wrong, and wont automount
Mar 07 21:57:55 <bprompt>	Square: you can list  your devices with -> lsblk <- once you know which device it's, you can use -> sudo blkid <-  to get its UUID to  be used in the /etc/fstab file for "automounting"
Mar 07 21:58:37 <Square>	Gotcha. I'll try to use this info to make it work next reboot
Mar 07 22:40:49 <oerheks>	yes!

Mar 09 15:47:23 <applepear>	hello
Mar 09 17:03:13 <yziquel>	I need to install a package without running its scripts. Specifically, I need to install the plocate package, to get the updatedb executable, but it insists on running the updatedb scripts. which creates a sevee problem on my VM. How do I install a package without running its postinst scripts ?
Mar 09 17:05:19 <oerheks>	unpack it, and copy them manually? you might run into other issues, why would it create severe problems?
Mar 09 17:13:38 <yziquel>	oerheks installing plocate starts updatedb. i'm on VM with virtiofs. the updatedb script just takes FOREVER (now that it does not blow up the number of file descriptors on the host). I've been on that on and off for a month. I just need to install updatebd without running it. and then try to run it in a way I can debug. As of today, either I
Mar 09 17:13:39 <yziquel>	install updatedb, it runs, and it screws up my system. Either I don't install it and... i can't debug it.
Mar 09 17:13:59 <yziquel>	so i need a way to stop the post-install script from running.
Mar 09 17:22:46 <leftyfb>	yziquel: make an alias for "updatedb" that does nothing
Mar 09 17:26:29 <yziquel>	leftyfb alias ? unclear.
Mar 09 17:27:39 <leftyfb>	export alias updatedb='/bin/true'
Mar 09 17:34:13 <yziquel>	leftyfb tried it. doesn't work. post-inst script still runs and updatebd is launched.
Mar 09 17:35:22 <cmk>	whats up
Mar 09 17:35:51 <leftyfb>	yziquel: you might have to set the alias as root
Mar 09 17:36:12 <yziquel>	leftyfb unclear what that means to me. I speak only french and english.
Mar 09 18:40:03 <oerheks>	i guess the 1st time plocate scans your whole system, that can take a while, just once.
Mar 09 18:52:01 <Guest8677>	hallo alle zusammen

Mar 09 19:46:38 <webchat46>	Hey all. I need help. I am not very tech savy. Is it possible to run Ubuntu over windows op sys? I was following tutorials and lost my SU commands and not am stuck. I called HP (new laptop) and windows support and they all say Linux is not supported
Mar 09 19:48:03 <rbox>	what does "lost my su commands" mean
Mar 09 19:48:11 <webchat46>	superuser commands
Mar 09 19:48:19 <rbox>	yes... still says nothing
Mar 09 19:48:48 <oerheks>	your 1st account has sudo rights .. forgot password?
Mar 09 19:49:18 <oerheks>	or tell us what tutorials you followed?
Mar 09 19:49:23 <webchat46>	I was downloading Unbuntu and gnome GUI and the online instructions had me doing SU commands like $ sudo apt update
Mar 09 19:50:08 <webchat46>	I have been unable to get back into the cmd screen to install, Im not that savy
Mar 09 19:50:16 <ioria>	webchat46, now you're sounding a chatbot

Mar 09 19:50:44 <ubottu>	webchat46: Forgot your password? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword What's the root password? See !sudo. Don't see *** in password prompts? That's normal. Sudo doesn't ask for your password? It remembers you for several minutes. Please use strong passwords, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/StrongPasswords
Mar 09 19:52:13 <webchat46>	I have my pwsrd, thats not my issue.
Mar 09 19:52:28 <rbox>	you still havne't told us what the issue is
Mar 09 19:53:00 <oerheks>	can you clarify 'lost my SU commands' ?
Mar 09 19:53:03 <webchat46>	I am stuck trying to get back cmd screen to enter commands to finish ubuntu downloads
Mar 09 19:53:14 <kostkon>	webchat46, become a bit more articulate if that is possible
Mar 09 19:53:48 <webchat46>	NM I will keep search for a dummies guide lol I am not that tech savy
Mar 09 19:54:04 <rbox>	yes, you've mentioend that a few times
Mar 09 19:54:21 <akik>	webchat46: so you forgot your password or what?
Mar 09 19:54:40 <oerheks>	ctrl alt t opens terminal again, but if you closed it, the command used has stopped.
Mar 09 19:54:41 <kostkon>	well so long
Mar 09 19:54:53 <oerheks>	oh
Mar 09 20:35:37 <anadon>	I'm looking to add the packages for ROCm 6  (https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rocm-compilersupport) to my 23.10 install ahread of the 24.04 release.  I do not see information to add repository information so those packages will be picked up.  How should I be adding them?
Mar 09 20:40:42 <rbox>	thats because those packages are already part of the regular ubuntu repos
Mar 09 20:40:47 <rbox>	nothing to add
Mar 09 20:45:00 <anadon>	The 5.3 ones are in 23.10.  I want to install PyTorch which requires 5.7+.
Mar 09 20:45:25 <rbox>	well ther eis 5.2 and 6.0
Mar 09 20:45:48 <rbox>	you could manually download the .deb files
Mar 09 20:45:51 <rbox>	and hope they dont break eveythitng
Mar 09 20:45:52 <rbox>	lol
Mar 09 20:46:15 <anadon>	I was hoping for not that...
Mar 09 20:46:19 <anadon>	Ick.
Mar 09 20:47:15 <oerheks>	you noticed that 24.04 LTS gives v6 ?
Mar 09 20:47:36 <rbox>	well you could add the repo with the 6
Mar 09 20:47:40 <rbox>	but thats just gonna break everyhting
Mar 09 20:47:40 <rbox>	lol
Mar 09 20:47:47 <oerheks>	yeah, probably
Mar 09 20:47:58 <rbox>	not probably
Mar 09 20:47:58 <rbox>	it will
Mar 09 20:48:01 <oerheks>	one could test 24.04 already..
Mar 09 20:58:43 <anadon>	How stable is it even, yet?
Mar 09 20:59:53 <rbox>	well its already march 9th and april is next month...
Mar 09 21:00:06 <rbox>	i'd be pretty worried if it was still crashy and buggy
Mar 09 21:06:10 <anadon>	But this is my primary system.  Looks like for the net two months, I'll be pinned to using PyTorch's CPU implementation.
Mar 09 21:06:32 <rbox>	you could copmile it yosuelf
Mar 09 21:06:33 <rbox>	lol
Mar 09 21:06:39 <anadon>	boi
Mar 09 21:06:52 <anadon>	ain't nobody got the time for dat
Mar 09 21:49:31 <houseparty>	Can someone advise on a good strategy to handle packages which are frequently uninstalled by apt. I am not doing anything like dpkg -r or apt remove ... I also run an apt-mark manual script through a cronjob. Nonetheless, certain packages get remove periodically then I have to rerun an install script. In particular, I'm fighting with Discord. It is
Mar 09 21:49:31 <houseparty>	not playing fair.
Mar 09 21:56:12 <bprompt>	hmmm
Mar 09 21:56:23 <bprompt>	houseparty: that's kinda odd, apt removing stuff?
Mar 09 22:02:13 <houseparty>	yeah, I had to avoid the hostility in #linux
Mar 09 22:02:52 <houseparty>	Rage fits... Yeah, it's odd... apt-mark manual should fix it but it's not...
Mar 09 22:04:01 <bprompt>	houseparty: well, seems to be an assumption you may be making, for something else, no?   I mean, I haven't had that happenning with Apt
Mar 09 22:04:32 <houseparty>	It might be Discord doing it... Discord won't launch on Jammy - at least on this host - unless I update it. Discord tells me to download the .deb binary, so I do... Or actually, I cancel it and run a script that does the same thing the binary would do if I were to install it manually
Mar 09 22:04:37 <houseparty>	OK
Mar 09 22:06:47 <bprompt>	houseparty: I don't use Discord myself, hmmm so hmm, sounds like a discord issue though, not an Apt one, did you install it using "snap" or as a .deb install?
Mar 09 22:07:06 <houseparty>	So, I don't know if it will work... maybe I can do this: https://bpa.st/QCEQ
Mar 09 22:07:09 <ravage>	the discord snap works fine 🙂
Mar 09 22:07:53 <houseparty>	It's the deb... Oh, I can try the Snap... I didn't know there is one. I think Discord says to use the deb so that's probably why I started doing it but you're right thinking that. The snap is the preferred method on Ubuntu.
Mar 09 22:08:43 <bprompt>	houseparty: try removing fully the .deb version first, no need for any remainders
Mar 09 22:08:43 <ravage>	it is usually better than a PPA. and always better than installing single deb files you have to update manually
Mar 09 22:08:53 <houseparty>	I use this script ... it works perfectly except for I have to run it about once a month:
Mar 09 22:08:53 <houseparty>	https://bpa.st/CRIQ. I wrote that.
Mar 09 22:09:24 <houseparty>	The trap cleanup function is cool because it removes unnecessary folders and it keeps the program directory tidy that way.
Mar 09 22:11:48 <houseparty>	Maybe I tried the snap at some point and it broke so I quit using it. But that is my fault ... I tinker a lot and I probably broke it, hehe. Anyway, thank you. I appreciate your help.
Mar 09 22:15:31 <houseparty>	Yeah, I confirmed it. And sorry for the noise... Discord once you to use the Deb. And I have no idea why. I am actually curious. I'm going to contact one of their devs as I'm sure they have a reason. My guess is that if you use the deb it will work on all Debian based distros as the snap won't work when or if snap is not installed.
Mar 09 22:15:36 <houseparty>	*wants
Mar 09 22:17:38 <jeremy31>	For Discord you might be better of using the browser version
Mar 09 22:18:50 <houseparty>	Yeah, I agree jeremy31. Thanks for saying that. I have a friend who does that. I think for most popular apps, that's how he rolls. I guess I just run so many tabs that I like the apps. I am glad you said that ... If the snap doesn't do what I want, I think that will be the next step.
Mar 09 22:20:03 <houseparty>	Do you guys get annoyed when the app developers don't list the snap info in the download sections of their websites?
Mar 09 22:23:21 <bprompt>	houseparty: may just be an oversight, or a webpage not lately updated
Mar 09 22:23:25 <jeremy31>	That discord deb seems to update about twice a week, then it updates again when you run the program
Mar 09 22:26:48 <houseparty>	Yeah, that's what I'm saying... who's going to put up with that, haha.
Mar 09 22:27:36 <houseparty>	So they think a Linux user wants to deal with that. They're causing noob panic... the great noob scare - as opposed to the great recession or great depression.
Mar 09 22:28:00 <houseparty>	I'm not a noob but I tell a lot of people to switch to Linux and they don't want to deal with that
Mar 09 23:39:01 <baggy>	when i imstall ubuntu from store it says WELCOME TO UBUNTU... Preparing Ubuntu.. how lond should i wait
Mar 09 23:40:27 <baggy>	is it down
Mar 09 23:40:35 <baggy>	or it my end
Mar 09 23:42:12 <oerheks>	install ubuntu from store?
Mar 09 23:42:51 <leftyfb>	!wsl | baggy
Mar 09 23:42:51 <ubottu>	baggy: Windows 10 and newer have a feature called "Windows Subsystem for Linux", which allows it to run Ubuntu (and other Linux distro) userspace programs without porting/recompliation. For installation instructions, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide
Mar 10 00:02:50 <baggy>	how long does prep take
Mar 10 00:02:56 <baggy>	over an hour?
Mar 10 00:03:10 <baggy>	fist time doing this
Mar 10 00:06:51 <ravage>	no it should not take that long
Mar 10 00:07:12 <ravage>	but we cant really help much with that here. the whole setup process is managed by windows
Mar 10 00:07:35 <baggy>	thanks
Mar 10 00:08:08 <baggy>	ill load
Mar 10 00:08:54 <bprompt>	baggy: go make dinner, and come back :)

Mar 10 00:28:58 <src>	any1 familiar w/ sw arrays on linux, more particularly mdadm? I have two nvme drives in my machine, one of which contains my ubuntu install (luks + encryption), can I use the second nvme as a mirrored drive (raid 1) via mdadm?
Mar 10 00:29:45 <rbox>	src: https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=linux+convert+non+raid+to+raid+1
Mar 10 00:29:51 <src>	I'm unsure whether it's a problem that I want to a) mirror the very drive that is my root drive and contains my install and b) mirror a drive which is encrypted (and want my mirrored drive to obviously be as well)

Mar 10 00:33:04 <ravage>	the combination of RAID and encryption is not supported by the installer
Mar 10 00:33:19 <ravage>	learned that the hard way with my 24.04 setup 🙂
Mar 10 00:33:29 <houseparty>	You're recommending a type 1 hypervisor for Windows on a Linux channel - in response to WSL? And don't get me wrong, I love WSL ...
Mar 10 00:33:57 <ravage>	who is "you" ?
Mar 10 00:35:05 <bprompt>	"you" is not the "other" =)
Mar 10 00:35:56 <ravage>	src: i ended up manually setting up my system with debootstrap. i now have 24.04 with an encrypted software RAID 1. it seems to be the only way to do that. i got a little further with the server installer. but even that did not really want to cooperate all the way through
Mar 10 00:36:34 <bprompt>	houseparty: the question pertained to installing Linux on a windows10 machine through the MS store, thus the need for the hypervisor
Mar 10 00:37:06 <src>	ravage: ty for the input, damn I hoped it'd be more straight forward than that... :/
Mar 10 00:37:10 <bprompt>	24.04?   you're early by a month =)
Mar 10 00:37:24 <houseparty>	Oh, I was unaware of the context.I can see where you were going with it now that you said that.
Mar 10 00:37:27 <ravage>	i always test LTS releases to report bugs
Mar 10 00:37:52 <houseparty>	I like Hyper-V but it is a pain to maintain... the networking can get wonky - and more so for me since I use a lot of VMs
Mar 10 00:37:56 <ravage>	but the version does not really matter. same with every version starting with 22.04
Mar 10 00:38:11 <houseparty>	I spent around two hours yesterday messing with Hyper-V.
Mar 10 00:38:47 <bprompt>	ravage: can you update from a beta to an final version?
Mar 10 00:39:19 <ravage>	yes. you just do your usual package updates
Mar 10 00:39:25 <src>	ravage: alright, I'll simply partition the second nvme, and run a backup script to sync various files; it won't serve as a drop in replacement in case of the first nvme dying, but will be backup nonetheless
Mar 10 00:39:25 <bprompt>	I mean, most I OSes, you have to toss the testing version and do a full i install of the final
Mar 10 00:39:56 <src>	ravage: and the second nvme can be encrypted w/out problem and I dodge a lot of work
Mar 10 00:40:15 <ravage>	src: sounds like a good plan
Mar 10 00:40:29 <src>	I've got an external nvme case for two nvmes anyways
Mar 10 00:40:50 <src>	I could always plug one out there and insert into my machine if the system nvme broke
Mar 10 00:40:56 <houseparty>	You can update anything but - and I don't know how long anyone here has been using anyone - changing some things may break other things. Even then, few things, aside from breaking grub are unfixable.
Mar 10 00:41:30 <src>	ravage: big thanks btw, was difficult to find conrecte info on software raid w/ an encrypted system drive
Mar 10 00:41:48 <ravage>	yw, sorry that i dont have better news 🙂
Mar 10 00:41:58 <bprompt>	" how long anyone here has been using anyone"?    well, forever, I use "anyone" at the supermarket for checking out for example :P
Mar 10 00:45:44 <houseparty>	And you can fix grub but if the system won't even boot that's a lot of work.
Mar 10 00:57:03 <applecuckoo>	Hi! I seem to have broken my networking, since I can no longer connect to WiFi. Running Ubuntu 23.10 with an Intel AX201.
Mar 10 00:57:56 <applecuckoo>	I’ve tested the Wifi on a live image, so I’ve definitely bricked something within my installation.
Mar 10 01:01:29 <applecuckoo>	The only command that might’ve caused the damage would be sudo ifconfig enx8038fddb072f 192.168.0.1
Mar 10 01:04:33 <rbox>	thats not persistent
Mar 10 01:15:07 <nothingeleven>	hello?

Mar 10 04:12:23 <houseparty>	Cant' see why it would not work and if it does not, write a bash script.
Mar 10 04:12:35 <houseparty>	Or... I'm always bored... You can query me and if I have time, I'll do it
Mar 10 04:15:04 <esv>	did you get to install ubuntu on win10?
Mar 10 04:15:10 <esv>	why not use WSL?
Mar 10 04:22:29 <esv>	so basically, I'm trying to leverage to automatically install an Ubuntu 22.04 desktop using autoinstall, but the install process seems to be ignored
Mar 10 04:23:23 <esv>	here is how I am doing it: https://dpaste.com/6B2WEFEFU

Mar 10 06:59:21 <webchat92>	Hello. My device is Lenovo ThinkPad L480. I installed a single boot Ubuntu 20.04.4 from a bootable USB on my system. There was a glitch with Bluetooth connectivity, so I upgraded the firmware, and suddenly the system switched off.
Mar 10 07:00:48 <webchat92>	When I tried to boot the following error comes: (A7) Me FW Downgrade - Request MeSpiLock failed.
Mar 10 07:02:42 <webchat92>	Any help available?
Mar 10 07:19:51 <misra>	what is this program for?
Mar 10 07:20:10 <akik>	this program is for chatting
Mar 10 07:21:24 <misra>	thanks, this is my firts experience using lubuntu i'm just exploring apps included
Mar 10 07:23:53 <Bashing-om>	misra: You have landed in the Ubuntu support channel :D
Mar 10 07:29:59 <diogeness>	misra: first experience counts :)
Mar 10 07:32:51 <tanath>	misra: you might be familiar with discord. this is similar, using irc protocols & servers. it's what discord's design is based on, and has been around longer than the web
Mar 10 07:33:32 <akik>	which program on ubuntu is configured to join here?
Mar 10 07:57:17 <misra>	thank you guys, i appreciate your kind messages
Mar 10 08:05:11 <misra>	see ya later
Mar 10 08:05:11 <misra>	take care
Mar 10 08:05:11 <misra>	bye
Mar 10 08:53:25 <akik>	why can't i update the firefox snap while firefox is running?
Mar 10 08:54:09 <ravage>	technical limitation. just not possible
Mar 10 08:55:43 <akik>	it was silly to put it into a snap in the first place
Mar 10 14:08:04 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Mar 10 15:56:49 <archie>	what's /usr/libexec/fwupd/fwupd? it's using 102mb on my ubuntu server and that seems abnormally high
Mar 10 16:00:47 <tsimpson>	fwupd is an open-source daemon for managing the installation of firmware updates on Linux-based systems
Mar 10 17:48:06 <cbreak>	tried kubuntu-wayland a bit, but it seems still much slower than kubuntu-x11
Mar 10 17:49:46 <rbox>	so dont use it?
Mar 10 17:51:27 <archie>	rbox: why not?
Mar 10 17:51:49 <rbox>	he just said its slower
Mar 10 17:52:43 <archie>	what if they like kubuntu-wayland more and are open to diagnose the cause of the slowness?
Mar 10 19:09:11 <cbreak>	I think wayland will be the future, since X11 is clearly on its last legs
Mar 10 19:09:25 <cbreak>	and seems to be deprecated in more and more distros
Mar 10 19:10:01 <cbreak>	the main difference in performance I've noticed in 3D games via Wine
Mar 10 19:10:43 <cbreak>	but the rest of the GUI also feels slower. (Nothing obvious though, the frame rate counter indicates expected 60 FPS)
Mar 10 19:11:01 <cbreak>	I'll probably try again with KDE 6
Mar 10 19:36:31 <s2>	hey

Mar 10 19:41:37 <bartosz>	hello
Mar 10 19:42:24 <bartosz>	i search program to index disk usb and catalog it
Mar 10 19:45:03 <rbox>	what does catalog mean
Mar 10 19:45:19 <ioria>	we'll never know
Mar 10 19:50:20 <bprompt>	hehe
Mar 10 19:50:34 <bprompt>	rbox: sounded like "rsync" something
Mar 10 20:10:42 <ic56>	bartosz: the traditional unix tools for such tasks are find(1), ls(1), and file(1).  The choice depends on your preferred output format.  For example, supposing the "disk" in question is mounted at /media/usb0 , you might try: cd /media/usb0 && find . |sed 's|./||' |sort  The sort(1) command is necessary because find(1), unlike ls(1), traverses directories as written to disk, without sorting.  The sed(1)
Mar 10 20:10:48 <ic56>	command reduces the output.  There are faster ways to accomplish that; this is more legible for a novice.  The other option, "ls -lR", produces pretty output but not helpful for searches.  file(1) can be used in a loop to produce information about each file.  Eg save the sorted find(1) output to a file, then do something like this: (while read j; do printf '%s\t' $j; file $j; done) <f1 >f2
Mar 10 20:11:38 <rbox>	he quit ages ago...
Mar 10 20:11:47 <bprompt>	ic56: ahemm, he kinda left a while back =)
Mar 10 20:11:52 <ic56>	rbox: ah. thanks
Mar 10 20:12:20 <bprompt>	ic56: your connection maybe caught in a DST timewarp, either that or just laggy =)
Mar 10 20:12:25 <ic56>	I don't watch who's on or not.  The answer benefits lurkers anyway.
Mar 10 20:14:01 <ic56>	thanks, bprompt.

Mar 11 11:18:05 *	Topic for #ubuntu set by krytarik (Sun Jan 28 15:23:05 2024)
Mar 11 11:18:05 -ChanServ-	[#ubuntu] Welcome to #ubuntu. This channel is logged. Use of this channel implies acceptance of terms at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/TermsOfService
Mar 11 11:26:24 <OnkelTem>	Hi folks. When I start executing iproute2 commands, NetworkManager stops seeing my ethernet interface because it assigns a different UUID to the one I bring up with iproute2
Mar 11 11:26:48 <OnkelTem>	What should I do? Should I disable NM from managing my ethernet?
Mar 11 11:27:51 <OnkelTem>	I just don't get why if I do like: `dhclient enp7s0` NM doesn't "see it" as a valid "Wired connection 1" that it knows
Mar 11 11:28:26 <OnkelTem>	So in fact I now have two interfaces: https://termbin.com/u83u
Mar 11 11:29:18 <OnkelTem>	(until I manually run the "Wired connection 1" one from NM UI, and then my enp7s0 intrface disappears as you see)
Mar 11 11:48:00 <ogra_>	OnkelTem, why not use the correct tools ? if you use NM you suld also use its cli tools to manipulate routes to not make different technologies clash ... nmcli can very well do everything you'd do with "ip route .."
Mar 11 11:49:10 <OnkelTem>	ogra_: I don't think it can do what I need. But I agree that I shouldn't make different things to clash
Mar 11 11:49:55 <OnkelTem>	I'm reading now about so called "Netplan". I don't get is it natural to Ubuntu? Will it play nice with NM?
Mar 11 11:50:02 <OnkelTem>	Is it under or above it or what
Mar 11 11:50:52 <ogra_>	netplan is a frontend to configure networking ... it can use systemd-networkd or netplan as its backends
Mar 11 11:50:57 <ogra_>	bah
Mar 11 11:51:17 <ogra_>	it can use systemd-networkd or *NM* as its backends
Mar 11 11:52:22 <ogra_>	so yes, it might be an option to do what you want by using the very frontend (which makes internally sure that the technologies do not clash)
Mar 11 11:52:34 <OnkelTem>	netplan is a frontend? It didn't look like one when I was reading its tutorial LOL
Mar 11 11:52:46 <OnkelTem>	but ok, I'm not arguing I just don't know
Mar 11 11:52:48 <ogra_>	it is a "generator"
Mar 11 11:53:05 <ogra_>	to either generate NM or networkd configs ...
Mar 11 11:53:47 <OnkelTem>	Ok, so NM is more than its UI, isn't it? Because when I talk about NM, I think only about its UI and I definitely don't remember things I need to configure via iproute2
Mar 11 11:53:58 <ogra_>	https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
Mar 11 11:54:13 <OnkelTem>	yeah, I'm reading it
Mar 11 11:55:16 <OnkelTem>	What I need is: creata a bridge, add there my "eth0", then create a pair of veth-s, place one into the bridge and another one - into a namespaced network created via `ip netns`
Mar 11 11:55:33 <OnkelTem>	then inside that netns I should bring up an OpenVPN connection
Mar 11 11:56:05 <OnkelTem>	I think I can do at least hafl of this job using netplan, and finish the rest via iproute2
Mar 11 11:56:19 <OnkelTem>	namely - make a bridge
Mar 11 11:56:27 <OnkelTem>	using netplan
Mar 11 11:56:59 <ogra_>	i dont think you should need or use iproute at all, netplan should surely offer all you need
Mar 11 11:57:15 <OnkelTem>	ok, thanks. I continue reading the docs then.
Mar 11 11:57:58 <ogra_>	(it is definitely doing bridging fine on millions of cloud installs out there... I'd be surprised if it would require additional tools)
Mar 11 12:13:11 <nikolam>	hi.  I tried to create iSCSI initiator (client) on XUbuntu 22.04 , for iSCS target (server) that is already working well in MS windows. it doe snot require authentication at the moment. but sudo iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p IP_address does not give nothing..
Mar 11 12:18:46 <OnkelTem>	ogra_: seems like I cannot use network manager as a backend if I'm gonna configure something in netplan
Mar 11 12:19:15 <OnkelTem>	The examples section https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/ shows that they always change "renderer" to networkd whenever there's a need configure something
Mar 11 12:21:27 <cbreak_>	OnkelTem: you can use network manager as backend
Mar 11 12:21:56 <cbreak_>	I do that.
Mar 11 12:22:23 <OnkelTem>	cbreak_: so you still have some configuration like below the renderer line?
Mar 11 12:22:28 <cbreak_>	yes
Mar 11 12:22:31 <OnkelTem>	thanks!
Mar 11 12:23:14 <OnkelTem>	Ok, I ran through Netplan docs and I didn't find there anything about namespaces. Seems like I cannot configure my setup with netplan only, iproute2 is still needed
Mar 11 12:23:30 <cbreak_>	looks aproximately like this: https://gist.github.com/cbreak-black/9ff7cc1fbb61d6ceb799ece3c832ff08
Mar 11 12:23:43 <OnkelTem>	cool!
Mar 11 12:23:46 <cbreak_>	since I want to use ipv6 auto configure, but also a static IP
Mar 11 12:24:01 <cbreak_>	no idea about namespaces
Mar 11 12:24:11 <OnkelTem>	what is the point/difference then between those two backends - networkd and NM?
Mar 11 12:24:20 <cbreak_>	I think the different renderers support different things. With networkd, I couldn't get it to work
Mar 11 12:24:36 <OnkelTem>	I see
Mar 11 12:25:43 <cbreak_>	you want to hard-code routing entries?
Mar 11 12:26:38 <cbreak_>	https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/netplan-yaml/#routing
Mar 11 12:26:54 <ogra_>	OnkelTem, two backends -> simply to support server and desktop likewise ... server does usually not install NM
Mar 11 12:27:33 <ogra_>	(unless your server has a mobile 4G/5G connection you wont really need NM)
Mar 11 12:28:55 <OnkelTem>	cbreak_: No, my routing is dead simple. I just want to create an isolated network namespace where I run OpenVPN from. This way, I should be able run any program via the vpn connection by just prefixing with `ip netns exec MyVpnNS`
Mar 11 12:29:22 <OnkelTem>	E.g. $ ip netns exec MyVpnNS google-chrome-stable
Mar 11 12:30:07 <cbreak>	hmm... I use lxc for that
Mar 11 12:30:21 <OnkelTem>	a container, I see
Mar 11 12:30:22 <cbreak>	I have lxc containers that use different VPNs for everything inside
Mar 11 12:30:29 <OnkelTem>	a *full* contauner, right?
Mar 11 12:30:43 <cbreak>	well... it's just an LXC contatiner, not a real VM
Mar 11 12:30:49 <OnkelTem>	never used lxc, honestly. I think it just makes all that isolation inside
Mar 11 12:31:01 <OnkelTem>	with netns
Mar 11 12:31:11 <cbreak>	it shares the kernel with the outside
Mar 11 12:31:12 <OnkelTem>	sure, I understand, it's like docker
Mar 11 12:31:23 <cbreak>	but somehow, wireguard still works despite being kernel space
Mar 11 12:32:22 <cbreak>	but starting transmission-daemon inside is easy, and starting firefox inside (with x11 and so on) also works with a bit of configuration
Mar 11 12:33:09 <OnkelTem>	hm, maybe I should also consider this. As using netns directly isn't convered/documented well in the internet
Mar 11 12:33:31 <nikolam>	I wonder why iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p IP_adress doe snot give any results, where iSCSi target from the same server is working just fine with initiator running on MS Win 10.
Mar 11 12:33:39 <OnkelTem>	cbreak: what would you recommend to read first?
Mar 11 12:33:58 <OnkelTem>	goal 1: run browser inside LXC container
Mar 11 12:35:11 <OnkelTem>	also, I would like not to use another user id for this. (If I reckoned it an option, I could have configured just user-id based routing)
Mar 11 12:36:24 <cbreak>	I think I followed https://blog.simos.info/running-x11-software-in-lxd-containers/
Mar 11 12:36:34 <OnkelTem>	cbreak: thanks!
Mar 11 12:44:12 <OnkelTem>	Ok, my netplan version is 106, and virtual-ethernets appear only on 107
Mar 11 12:44:18 <OnkelTem>	so I need to update netplan somehow
Mar 11 12:44:30 <OnkelTem>	Kubuntu 22.04 here
Mar 11 12:45:07 <ravage>	not a good (net)plan probably. wait a little longer for 24.04
Mar 11 12:45:24 <OnkelTem>	I cannot wait, I need to configure virtual ethernets
Mar 11 12:46:11 <ravage>	22.04 does not provide the version you want
Mar 11 12:46:35 <OnkelTem>	I know, I expect there's a PPA or something
Mar 11 12:48:23 <OnkelTem>	ok, seems like netplan cannot do even that now. So I can use only its bridge functionality out of my long setup
Mar 11 12:51:03 <OnkelTem>	And it doesn't seem like NetworkManager support namespaces
Mar 11 12:56:10 <cbreak>	seems I have 0.107-5 from 23.10
Mar 11 13:41:45 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Mar 11 15:34:13 <Code_Bleu>	Just curious what people are using for patch management of Ubuntu servers?  I'm currently needing an opensource/free solution at the moment.  Preferrabley something more than me just writing Ansible or Puppet to manage it.  Something with Lifecycle management..etc.
Mar 11 16:00:51 <ogra_>	Code_Bleu, what do you mean by "patch management" ? Ubuntu is a binary distro, "patch management" happens on a per-package level, all you need to do is to make sure to keep your packages up to date to be on the latest patchlevel ...
Mar 11 16:07:08 <Code_Bleu>	ogra_: management of updating packages
Mar 11 16:08:26 <ogra_>	ah, right ... well, there is the unattended-updates package pre-installed that lets you configure a lot of actions around this, not sure you actually *need* an external tool for it
Mar 11 16:09:31 <ogra_>	(see: man unattended-upgrades )
Mar 11 16:10:36 <Code_Bleu>	ogra_: for example: I have 200 servers, I want to be able to see that 98 of them have the same package on an old version and be able to setup a lifecycle to update those in my development environment first, then staging...then prod.  A proper lifecycle deployment of updating of software packages.
Mar 11 16:12:09 <pick>	Hello, I see that one can apt install package=version , is there a way to apt upgrade to a newer but not the newest version?
Mar 11 16:13:06 <leftyfb>	pick: you just answered your own question
Mar 11 16:13:49 <pick>	so apt upgrade  package=version  should work?
Mar 11 16:13:53 <leftyfb>	yes
Mar 11 16:15:08 <pick>	thanks google was throwing out a cloud of chaff results about apt install
Mar 11 16:18:01 <pick>	I'm not clear on the format tho.... if 'apt list -a --upgradable' returns results like package/xenial 7.0.0 amd64, do I just use  'apt upgrade  package=7.0.0' or do I have to include the xenial somehow ?
Mar 11 16:18:15 <pick>	or the amd64 ?
Mar 11 16:18:26 <leftyfb>	pick: 16.04 is multiple years End of Life
Mar 11 16:19:54 <pick>	oh, its a third party repository, checking if they have jammy
Mar 11 16:20:18 <leftyfb>	there's no guarantee any of this is going to work with a 3rd party repo
Mar 11 16:21:29 <pick>	the current installed version is labelled xenial, maybe its just the minimum requirement
Mar 11 16:21:47 <pick>	it works fine.
Mar 11 16:22:25 <oerheks>	good luck with that, it might be a honeypot now.
Mar 11 16:22:26 <pick>	in any case do I put xenial or amd64 or just  'apt upgrade  package=7.0.0'
Mar 11 16:25:08 <pick>	the developers release a new version every week or two, but they are all labelled xenial
Mar 11 16:27:35 <leftyfb>	pick: apt-cache policy <package name>
Mar 11 16:27:42 <leftyfb>	get the available versions from there
Mar 11 16:30:21 <pick>	hmm the list looks similar.  but how do I assemble a working URL from the pieces there?
Mar 11 16:30:39 <leftyfb>	sudo apt install package=version
Mar 11 16:31:32 <pick>	oh so I don't have to roll my own URL from .....org/desktop/apt xenial/main amd64 Packages
Mar 11 16:31:58 <leftyfb>	URL?
Mar 11 16:32:06 <leftyfb>	sudo apt install package=version
Mar 11 16:32:11 <leftyfb>	sudo apt install package-name=version
Mar 11 16:32:36 <pick>	so apt install also works as an apt upgrade
Mar 11 16:32:47 <leftyfb>	or downgrade, yes
Mar 11 16:37:20 <pick>	thank you very much ...  now I see that man apt-get is clearer about this than man apt, which is correct but ambiguous to the uninformed.
Mar 11 16:58:18 <milktoast>	I've used dd with hdd and it always worked.. now ssd are physically different.... so, can I dd from and 120GB ssd to a 1TB ssd?  Trying to increase the size of a Laptop and keep the OS, software and data.
Mar 11 16:58:54 <leftyfb>	yes
Mar 11 16:59:13 <milktoast>	great. thanks
Mar 11 17:00:07 <oerheks>	be aware after that DD action, the UUID changes of your partitions ?
Mar 11 17:00:59 <milktoast>	other than mounting, what else would that effect?
Mar 11 17:01:47 <oerheks>	your grub mismatches, use blkid to identify the new ones
Mar 11 17:01:50 <leftyfb>	just mounting, of it's part of some volume or array
Mar 11 17:02:04 <oerheks>	*if the os is on that disk
Mar 11 17:09:31 <milktoast>	got disconnected ...
Mar 11 17:09:32 <milktoast>	hmm, now I'm thinking.. if I DD 120GB onto a 1TB, will the 120GB be the first partition or ?? ... will I need to make other partitions after the 120GB
Mar 11 17:09:32 <milktoast>	or is there a better way to clone the small SSD to the large SSD
Mar 11 17:10:45 <leftyfb>	milktoast: it will go a LOT easier if you just consider your target a blank slate. dd your source to the target, then use partition and filesystem tools to resize to utilize the entire drive
Mar 11 17:10:59 <leftyfb>	milktoast: dd the entire drive, not partitions
Mar 11 17:13:37 <milktoast>	leftyfb: .. that is what I was thinking. It is blank.
Mar 11 17:14:23 <swift110-mobile>	Good afternoon. Are you guys using mate’
Mar 11 17:14:34 <p3lim>	how can I test the match targets for the autoinstall/curtin storage options? e.g. it says in the docs that it's supposed to use "ID_VENDOR" from udev for the "match" keypair, but I can't seem to get it working
Mar 11 17:17:41 <swift110-mobile>	The Linux User Space podcast did a great job detailing the history of Mate’ in episode 4:14

Mar 11 17:25:49 <swift110-mobile>	Ok
Mar 11 18:06:05 <martti>	ugm, I have a question. we installed a couple of virtual machines with ubuntu 22.04 around october last year. our installation scripts use `openssl genrsa 4096` to create a private key, but around that time it seems like there was a switch of default format, from PKCS#1 to PKCS#8, which basically means that the type of key was dropped from the envelope.
Mar 11 18:08:08 <martti>	strangely, after one case of `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` on oct 3, there were 4 more installs that got `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`, but I suppose our installation method hasn't changed.
Mar 11 18:34:18 <jongsta>	should there be instructions on this site for how to fix the vulnerability? https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-5178
Mar 11 18:34:19 -ubottu/#ubuntu-	A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drivers/nvme/target/tcp.c` in `nvmet_tcp_free_crypto` due to a logical bug in the NVMe/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a malicious user to cause a use-after-free and double-free problem, which may permit remote code execution or lead to local privilege escalation. <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-5178>
Mar 11 18:34:41 <jongsta>	or are we supposed to know you just upgrade it to a newer, unaffected, version?
Mar 11 18:35:18 <stenno>	wait that sounds really serious
Mar 11 18:37:49 <oerheks>	jongsta, basicly yes. all kernels are patched,or ignored as the available update is not vulnerable.
Mar 11 18:38:03 <jongsta>	ok
Mar 11 18:38:31 <jongsta>	i haven't had to fix vulns in a while but for some reason i feel like i recall a section in these types of articles that explains how to fix the problem
Mar 11 18:38:38 <jongsta>	and i'm not seeing that with this one at least
Mar 11 18:38:58 <jongsta>	a simple "Remediation: upgrade kernel to unaffected version" would be enough
Mar 11 18:39:39 <oerheks>	the post is released when the updates are in place, usually

Mar 11 22:42:03 <chonkin>	I am on Ubuntu 20.04.1   with a KDE Plasma 5.12.8 .    This computer has a Nvidia  RTX 3070 in it (unfotunately).  The symptom I am having is that after every large compilation the  GUI elements become either frozen or extremely laggy.  This lag is so bad it makes the computer unusable, and I have written a bash script to automate rebooting it after every compile.    Today I want ot try to solve this problem once-and-for-all by replacing the
Mar 11 22:42:03 <chonkin>	Nvidia driver
Mar 11 22:42:13 <baggy>	 Gtk-WARNING **: 15:28:38.939: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap", how may this be done
Mar 11 22:45:28 <oerheks>	minimum driver would be 460
Mar 11 22:45:52 <chonkin>	here is the current situation on this machine https://dpaste.com/2VY87TNDB
Mar 11 22:46:47 <oerheks>	i would upgrade to 22.04, and use HWE
Mar 11 22:46:49 <oerheks>	!hwe
Mar 11 22:46:49 <ubottu>	The Ubuntu LTS enablement stacks provide newer kernel and X support for existing LTS releases, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack
Mar 11 22:46:58 <oerheks>	also available for 20.04 AFAIK
Mar 11 22:47:33 <chonkin>	oerheks   my boss put this computer together.  He should have considered an AMD option for the GPU.  But he went with an RTX3070,  kind of sending me down the creek
Mar 11 22:56:06 <chonkin>	I believe that the problem with the  GUI lags could be solved by trying a different (likely more recent) driver.  What role does the LTS Enablement play here?   The directions show that they want me to simply go back to the same driver that is already on here via `ubuntu-drivers list`
Mar 11 22:59:33 <oerheks>	newer mesa, kernel, .. 20.04 is pretty ancient today fot such good hardware
Mar 11 22:59:39 <oerheks>	c/for
Mar 11 22:59:51 <oerheks>	try hwe
Mar 11 23:00:11 <oerheks>	or better upgrade to 22.04, and add hwe on that
Mar 11 23:15:32 <chonkin>	oerheks,   okay I have this.  what is next step?   https://dpaste.com/2JH9SPWM7
Mar 11 23:17:29 <oerheks>	upgrade to 22.04? 3rd time
Mar 11 23:17:46 <oerheks>	you just have kernel 5.15.0-97
Mar 11 23:18:15 <oerheks>	22.04 would do 6.5.0-25

Mar 12 00:55:45 -ChanServ-	[#ubuntu] Welcome to #ubuntu. This channel is logged. Use of this channel implies acceptance of terms at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/TermsOfService
Mar 12 00:56:02 <baggy>	i know how to use xstart
Mar 12 00:56:09 <baggy>	u know prob
Mar 12 00:56:15 <arraybolt3>	baggy: not sure you'll find any buyers here :P What exactly are you trying to do that requires startx?
Mar 12 00:56:23 <baggy>	wsl
Mar 12 00:56:27 <baggy>	ubuntu
Mar 12 00:56:28 <arraybolt3>	ohhh
Mar 12 00:56:32 <arraybolt3>	ok one sec
Mar 12 00:58:20 <baggy>	startx
Mar 12 00:58:23 <baggy>	i meant
Mar 12 00:58:26 <baggy>	https://www.howtogeek.com/409115/how-to-delete-files-and-directories-in-the-linux-terminal/
Mar 12 00:58:40 <arraybolt3>	why exactly are you using startx in WSL? You can run graphical applications from the Start Menu after installing them.
Mar 12 00:58:47 <baggy>	change to 11??
Mar 12 00:58:49 <baggy>	i think
Mar 12 00:59:37 <arraybolt3>	startx is generally only used to start a full desktop, and even then only in very specific weird situations.
Mar 12 00:59:57 <arraybolt3>	According to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps WSL2 does not support running a full Linux desktop.
Mar 12 01:00:28 <baggy>	_XSERVTransmkdir: Mode of /tmp/.X11-unix should be set to 1777
Mar 12 01:00:34 <baggy>	what is that suppose to mean
Mar 12 01:00:45 <arraybolt3>	I don't know, I don't know what you're trying to do.
Mar 12 01:00:56 <baggy>	i dint do it yet
Mar 12 01:00:59 <arraybolt3>	Go back just a bit. You're trying to launch an entire DE within WSL. Why?
Mar 12 01:01:02 <baggy>	be cayse it slow
Mar 12 01:01:09 <baggy>	right?
Mar 12 01:01:09 <kostkon>	baggy, file perms? use chown?
Mar 12 01:01:11 <arraybolt3>	Launching a whole DE in WSL isn't possible.
Mar 12 01:01:18 <arraybolt3>	kostkon: I think they probably shouldn't do that right now.
Mar 12 01:01:30 <arraybolt3>	You could cause damage trying to "fix" something that isn't broken.
Mar 12 01:01:31 <kostkon>	arraybolt3, good call
Mar 12 01:01:41 <arraybolt3>	This doesn't work because it isn't designed to work yet.
Mar 12 01:01:51 <baggy>	i thojught ur suppose to chnage the file name
Mar 12 01:01:53 <baggy>	didnt try
Mar 12 01:01:56 <arraybolt3>	baggy: if your apps are slow, maybe you're missing the GPU drivers needed?
Mar 12 01:02:23 <arraybolt3>	See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps - it recommends you install drivers to enable virtual GPU so that you can have hardware accelerated graphics for your Linux apps.
Mar 12 01:02:29 <baggy>	i read it could slow it
Mar 12 01:02:32 <arraybolt3>	That should fix any "slowness" you notice, as much as can be fixed anyway.
Mar 12 01:02:34 <baggy>	the tree
Mar 12 01:02:49 <baggy>	i treed it
Mar 12 01:02:57 <baggy>	and i thought it was wrong
Mar 12 01:03:23 <arraybolt3>	You're giving very little details and very vague explanations. Right now without knowing what you're trying to do, it's impossible to tell for sure how to make it work.
Mar 12 01:03:29 <arraybolt3>	Why are you using `tree`?
Mar 12 01:03:51 <arraybolt3>	And how big of a directory are you trying to look at anyway?
Mar 12 01:03:56 <baggy>	_XSERVTransmkdir: Mode of /tmp/.X11-unix should be set to 1777
Mar 12 01:04:07 <baggy>	at startx
Mar 12 01:04:16 <arraybolt3>	startx won't work. Abandon startx.
Mar 12 01:04:24 <arraybolt3>	WSL2 explicitly does not support it.
Mar 12 01:04:34 <arraybolt3>	Whatever you're doing can be done without it.
Mar 12 01:04:36 <kostkon>	baggy, are you following some kind of tutorial on how to enable x11 in wsl
Mar 12 01:05:11 <baggy>	ubuntu-desktop-installer
Mar 12 01:05:11 <baggy>	        ├── 1276
Mar 12 01:05:12 <baggy>	        ├── 1286
Mar 12 01:05:12 <baggy>	        ├── common
Mar 12 01:05:12 <baggy>	        └── current -> 1286
Mar 12 01:05:33 <arraybolt3>	If you're just trying to look at all the files in a directory, use `tree` and don't worry about "slowness". If you use it on an absolutely massive directory and the slowness is noticable, install the GPU drivers, then install a hardware-accelerated terminal, launch it from the Start Menu, and use that.
Mar 12 01:06:08 <baggy>	wsl
Mar 12 01:06:11 <arraybolt3>	99% of the time though, so-called "slowness" is so negligible you won't care.
Mar 12 01:07:03 <baggy>	no change then
Mar 12 01:07:05 <baggy>	ok
Mar 12 01:07:08 <baggy>	sure?
Mar 12 01:07:21 <arraybolt3>	Pretty sure at least.
Mar 12 01:07:53 <arraybolt3>	(depending on what you're asking if I'm sure about - I'm definitely sure you shouldn't try to fix that odd _XSERVTransmkdir error, and I'm also sure you don't need startx to be able to use tree.)
Mar 12 01:12:19 <baggy>	i never really tried ubuntu except in the past.. :) https://www.howtogeek.com/409115/how-to-delete-files-and-directories-in-the-linux-terminal/ is the tutorial for basics
Mar 12 01:12:33 <baggy>	now i get some simple commands
Mar 12 03:36:17 <Tingo>	Hi..
Mar 12 03:36:55 <Tingo>	Hi, # openssl s_client IP:Port -tls1_2 -trace
Mar 12 03:37:09 <Tingo>	How can i check which SecLevel is used from above command ?
Mar 12 03:44:38 <pragmaticenigma>	Tingo, Unless you explicately set the SecLevel, it is either set by a configuration file, or going to be negotiated at time of connection
Mar 12 03:56:03 <sem>	I intend to install ubuntu on a partition of an SSD, and install grub to that disk, and select it from BIOS when I want to boot ubuntu. Does that sound reasonable?
Mar 12 03:56:21 <rbox>	sure
Mar 12 03:56:26 <sem>	The other dual-boot problem that I know to head off is to tell Ubuntu to leave the RTC in local time, not UTC
Mar 12 03:56:37 <sem>	because that will confuse windows
Mar 12 03:56:45 <sem>	if i don't do that
Mar 12 03:57:19 <sem>	do you all know of any good trustworthy references for dual boot best practices in this day and age?
Mar 12 03:57:38 <rbox>	best practice is to just get rid of windows
Mar 12 03:57:40 <rbox>	:P
Mar 12 03:58:52 <sem>	thanks that's very helpful

Mar 12 09:36:02 <ikonia>	improve in what way
Mar 12 09:36:24 <ikonia>	personally I don't think booting one install on multiple machines is a good model

Mar 12 20:03:40 <bprompt>	hmmmmm, is a kde app IIRC, I used it, didn't like it too much
Mar 12 20:04:04 <mkou>	its not that one
Mar 12 20:04:15 <bprompt>	eh?
Mar 12 20:04:34 <bprompt>	mkou: are you referring to Yakuake?
Mar 12 20:05:10 <mkou>	the name was close to termux
Mar 12 20:05:24 <mkou>	but its not the one termux
Mar 12 20:05:38 <bprompt>	well, yakuake does that =P
Mar 12 20:06:16 <mkou>	its not yakuake
Mar 12 20:06:25 <mkou>	but I will check it, might be good
Mar 12 20:07:05 <bprompt>	yakuake slides IN/OUT of the edges
Mar 12 20:07:55 <mkou>	left and right side possible?
Mar 12 20:08:11 <bprompt>	mkou:  yeap, is configurable from what I recall
Mar 12 20:09:28 <mkou>	ill give it a chance, but I really wish to find the one I used, the name was very close to termux
Mar 12 20:10:11 <mkou>	checked all "top 10 terminals" guides, no luck yet  :D
Mar 12 20:10:42 <bprompt>	hehe, and google's search AI help blows, heheh, doesn't show much
Mar 12 20:11:20 <mkou>	naturally shifted to duck 6-7 years ago
Mar 12 20:12:00 <mkou>	occasionally do a search on google, when on a fresh install and cant believe my eyes :D
Mar 12 20:12:04 <leftyfb>	mkou: tilda
Mar 12 20:12:09 <mkou>	leftyfb,
Mar 12 20:12:10 <mkou>	yes
Mar 12 20:12:15 <mkou>	i think it was tilda
Mar 12 20:12:15 <mkou>	man
Mar 12 20:13:40 <bprompt>	ahemm, tilda is not even close to termux :P
Mar 12 20:13:49 <bprompt>	I mean, name wise
Mar 12 20:14:27 <mkou>	no its not tilda, saw it in the top 10 suggestions
Mar 12 20:15:23 <mkou>	leave it, I will find it eventually and will share it here, you will love it
Mar 12 20:18:11 <bprompt>	mkou: were you running it before? was it installed?
Mar 12 20:18:22 <bprompt>	I mean, you can check logs
Mar 12 20:19:38 <mkou>	was long time ago
Mar 12 20:19:45 <mkou>	maybe an year
Mar 12 20:19:57 <mkou>	did few fresh installs since then
Mar 12 20:20:42 <bprompt>	mkou: then check your local hypnotist then =)
Mar 12 20:20:50 <mkou>	but do you know what Im thinking
Mar 12 20:21:21 <bprompt>	mkou:  yes, yakuake does that, slide from the edges in and out
Mar 12 20:21:34 <mkou>	ill try it
Mar 12 20:22:42 <mkou>	but listen, if cat is printing a file's content, while grep is searching for a string through files
Mar 12 20:23:01 <mkou>	right, so cat file | grep string
Mar 12 20:23:15 <mkou>	should be much better than just grep string
Mar 12 20:23:29 <leftyfb>	why?
Mar 12 20:23:38 <leftyfb>	grep string file
Mar 12 20:23:38 <mkou>	in terms of loading too much in the server
Mar 12 20:23:55 <leftyfb>	cat | grep spawns 2 processes
Mar 12 20:24:01 <leftyfb>	grep is only 1
Mar 12 20:24:07 <leftyfb>	cat | grep is pointless
Mar 12 20:24:25 <mkou>	I know, grep file string does what cat | grep string does,
Mar 12 20:24:39 <leftyfb>	except with twice the number of processes running
Mar 12 20:24:48 <mkou>	but m
Mar 12 20:25:55 <mkou>	but if you cat the file and grep from it, you are grepping one file
Mar 12 20:26:17 <leftyfb>	if you grep a file you are grepping one file
Mar 12 20:26:18 <mkou>	if you grep a directory, you are searching thought files and directories
Mar 12 20:26:24 <mkou>	so grep is heavier than cat + grep
Mar 12 20:26:32 <leftyfb>	huh?
Mar 12 20:26:50 <mkou>	I am not arguing , just trying to understand it
Mar 12 20:27:37 <leftyfb>	why would you compare cat | grep a file to grepping an entire directory structure recursively?
Mar 12 20:27:50 <leftyfb>	obviously cat file is only 1 file and grep -R will search all files
Mar 12 20:28:05 <leftyfb>	but if you already know the file name, then just use grep on the file name
Mar 12 20:28:16 <leftyfb>	if you don't know the file name, then cat isn't going to work regardless
Mar 12 20:28:51 <leftyfb>	unless you find | xargs | cat every file and then grep, which would be more resource intensive than just recursive grep
Mar 12 20:29:14 <mkou>	grep <string> from while in any directory vs cat file | grep <string>  from the print
Mar 12 20:29:49 <leftyfb>	grep <string> file
Mar 12 20:30:52 <leftyfb>	you seem to want to compare apples and oranges here
Mar 12 20:31:04 <mkou>	mhm ok
Mar 12 20:31:45 <leftyfb>	obviously if you grep every file in a directory structure it's going to take more resources/time than cat file | grep <string>. But you seem to keep ignoring the fact that you know the filename and can just use grep <string> file
Mar 12 20:32:40 <mkou>	yep make sens now

Mar 12 23:14:15 <stenno>	Tingo: for help with ircd, probably ask in #libera directly
Mar 12 23:14:55 <ZaY>	I want to uninstall all applications on ~/home/ubuntu
Mar 12 23:25:07 <oerheks>	If one build it right, there is an Uninstall
Mar 13 00:03:33 <derek-shnosh>	Ubuntu 23.10, Gnome 45.2, Kernel 6.5.0-25-generic... all of the sudden my USB-C connected display is not working. This is what I gleaned from journalctl: https://dpaste.com/BYM48EM4J
Mar 13 00:04:39 <oerheks>	derek-shnosh, does it get solved with pull and plug in again?
Mar 13 00:04:49 <derek-shnosh>	oerheks: no, it does not.
Mar 13 00:04:58 <oerheks>	happens sometimes with my system too, dvi and hdmi.
Mar 13 00:05:31 <derek-shnosh>	Also, my two other displays and NIC on my Dell dock are not working, but all USB devices connected to the dock are.
Mar 13 00:05:44 <oerheks>	oke, then i have no clue. found nothing usefull here in logs
Mar 13 00:05:57 <oerheks>	ah, dock, important info.
Mar 13 00:06:19 <derek-shnosh>	Hold on though.
Mar 13 00:06:41 <derek-shnosh>	One display is direct connected to my USB-C, cable just goes from USB-C to HDMI (no dongle, full cable).
Mar 13 00:06:50 <derek-shnosh>	The other two displays are on the dock (diff USB-C port).
Mar 13 00:09:24 <pragmaticenigma>	derek-shnosh: Have you tried powering down everything, including the dock... then turning things back on again?
Mar 13 00:09:56 <derek-shnosh>	pragmaticenigma: Yes I have. Even left everything disconnected and unplugged for an hour while running errands.
Mar 13 00:10:36 <oerheks>	pragmaticenigma, for me it happens with cold boot too
Mar 13 00:11:04 <pragmaticenigma>	just making sure the tried and true wasn't so tried and true
Mar 13 00:11:05 <pragmaticenigma>	:)
Mar 13 00:11:06 <derek-shnosh>	Typically I have to reseat the direct connected USB-C cable on boot, or power cycle the dock, to get the displays working... now they just won't.
Mar 13 00:12:11 <pragmaticenigma>	derek-shnosh: what about process of elimination? or removing everything and then re-adding one at a time?
Mar 13 00:12:50 <derek-shnosh>	I have, yes. Disconnected Dell dock, disconnected USB-C <> HDMI cable.
Mar 13 00:13:01 <derek-shnosh>	Then reconnect just the single display USB-C <> HDMI.
Mar 13 00:13:08 <derek-shnosh>	Sorry, its USB-C <> DP
Mar 13 00:16:05 <pragmaticenigma>	I'm stumped... hopefully the machine standalone works okay
Mar 13 00:20:04 <derek-shnosh>	pragmaticenigma: it does... but, my productivity pixel real estate is severely diminished.
Mar 13 00:20:16 <derek-shnosh>	missing out on 2x 2K displays and 1x 4K.
Mar 13 00:22:49 <derek-shnosh>	Going to boot off live USB and see if it persists.
Mar 13 00:43:56 <derek-shnosh>	Well this is very frustrating.
Mar 13 00:56:49 <derek-shnosh>	pragmaticenigma & oerheks : Culprit was hardware somehow (Lenovo Slim 7 ProX)... With the laptop on, I held the power button down for like 30s to perform a "power drain". Then powered it backup and loaded BIOS defaults and let it boot. Displays are working again.
Mar 13 00:57:59 <derek-shnosh>	Was prompted by this thread: https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-Yoga-Series-Laptops/Lenovo-Slim-7-ProX-14ARH7-not-detecting-my-external-monitor/m-p/5233873
Mar 13 01:00:10 <pragmaticenigma>	derek-shnosh: Lenovo machine with a Dell docking station?
Mar 13 01:13:51 <derek-shnosh>	pragmaticenigma: yeah, already had it readily avail from my work laptop.
Mar 13 01:14:25 <derek-shnosh>	The issue wasn't the dock though because one of the displays (with the USB-C <> DP cable) is directly connected to the laptop on another USB-C port... it wasn't working either.
Mar 13 01:15:33 <tv_>	hi
Mar 13 01:15:59 <derek-shnosh>	Didn't want to undo all my cable mgmt, dock is snap-velcro'ed to the bottom of the desk corner. https://i.imgur.com/NnDRm6m.jpeg
Mar 13 01:16:55 <pragmaticenigma>	derek-shnosh: well there's your problem... the dock is upside down, all the electrons fell out
Mar 13 01:17:04 <derek-shnosh>	>.<
Mar 13 01:17:15 <derek-shnosh>	Actually still right side up ;)
Mar 13 01:17:20 <tv_>	opa blz
Mar 13 01:17:54 <pragmaticenigma>	derek-shnosh: my former employers dell dock had powered fan, does yours as well?
Mar 13 01:18:22 <derek-shnosh>	pragmaticenigma: I think so... it's a WD22TB4 dock, I hear it spin up when I first power it on.
Mar 13 01:20:15 <pragmaticenigma>	I miss mine... new employer just got a cheapo Lenovo dock with DisplayLink... so no display until the machine is fully booted :(
Mar 13 01:40:10 <oerheks>	Derailed, good spot!
Mar 13 01:40:26 <oerheks>	err derek-shnosh

Mar 13 16:27:55 <Zed>	Since I am unable to buy the service directly from Microsoft I called Canonical directly. I was told by sales that I would get a quote in a day or so. I have been going back and fourth with them since February 20th but I still don't have a quote much less a contract.
Mar 13 16:28:26 <leftyfb>	Zed: you'll still need to work with Canonical
Mar 13 16:28:28 <lotuspsychje>	Zed: this channel holds only volunteers from the ubuntu community
Mar 13 16:28:30 <Menzador>	Zed: We're the community support channel. You're going to have to wait for Canonical themselves to get back to you
Mar 13 16:28:49 <leftyfb>	Zed: nobody else provides Ubuntu Pro services
Mar 13 16:28:59 <plastikman>	I have experience with the sales cycle at Canonical, its slow.
Mar 13 16:29:37 <plastikman>	but as stated here, you have no choice but to get the ESM packages from canonical.  you can set up an airgapped package repo (with the help of canonical) for these systems
Mar 13 16:30:03 <plastikman>	or, if you are feeling spicy, just set up a "personal" ubuntu pro sub and do a "pro attach xxxxx" on that system
Mar 13 16:30:37 <lotuspsychje>	plastikman: this is not really the place to discuss that
Mar 13 16:30:58 <akik>	huh
Mar 13 16:31:04 <Zed>	I understand all this. My question was phrased improperly. Is there any other way to get /all/ the available security patches...
Mar 13 16:31:18 <plastikman>	no
Mar 13 16:31:18 <akik>	you can't talk about ubuntu on #ubuntu. crazy
Mar 13 16:31:19 <leftyfb>	none that are supported here
Mar 13 16:32:08 <lotuspsychje>	akik: we try to divide ubuntu support issues, with user experiences/discussions into the right channels

Mar 13 17:32:07 <librton>	It shows my installation hdd there /dev/sda which I don't wanna overwrite
Mar 13 17:32:25 <ioria>	librton, what is that ? windows
Mar 13 17:32:28 <Menzador>	Destination, but that's more for legacy installations. Usually it'll detect whether it's in EFI mode and find the EFI system partition (ESP)
Mar 13 17:32:43 <Menzador>	So it's still best to select whichever disk holds the ESP
Mar 13 17:32:52 <Menzador>	It won't overwrite your disk
Mar 13 17:33:14 <Menzador>	It's telling what legacy argument to pass to the [ grub-install ] command
Mar 13 17:33:48 <ioria>	librton, but you said 'stuck at help & support'
Mar 13 17:34:16 <librton>	Thanks Menzador , I'm not sure if this old hp 600B G1 supports efi but I've created 800Mb partition just in case
Mar 13 17:34:33 <librton>	ioria: yes, I've restarted the system already

Mar 13 19:23:29 <librton>	maybe I'll give it a try with another distro to see how it works
Mar 13 19:27:03 <ioria>	librton, how did you do the usb-installer ?
Mar 13 19:27:23 <ioria>	librton, with what program ?
Mar 13 19:36:33 <lbracher>	Hello! Out of nowhere my bluetooth adapter disappears and I'm not able to recover it restarting the service. How could I diagnose what is happening? TIA!
Mar 13 19:45:24 <librton>	ioria: I've 500GB SATA hdd with bunch of linux & windows iso under Ventoy
Mar 13 19:46:46 <librton>	now I'm trying lmde and stuck again after the partitioning point saying "The EFI partition is too small. it must be at least 35MB" where in fact I didn't bother making efi partition knowing this is dos hdd and windows 7 on the other side of it
Mar 13 19:47:32 <ioria>	librton, you can't install on the same disk in bios and efi mode
Mar 13 19:48:43 <librton>	the windows partition is no longer booting after the second attempt of ubuntu, beside I didn't ask any of the linux distro to install/use EFI mode
Mar 13 19:49:37 <librton>	I'm not sure which isn't compatible with which because I didn't find any EFI related options with the CMOS BIOS Step of this pC
Mar 13 19:49:37 <ioria>	librton, i would do again the the installer with rufus (or etcher)
Mar 13 19:49:51 <librton>	not sure if it supports it
Mar 13 19:50:51 <ioria>	what ?
Mar 13 20:08:28 <librton>	what is the difference between partition flags boot and bls_boot in GParted?
Mar 13 20:08:44 <librton>	which should be given to efi partition?
Mar 13 20:12:51 <librton>	I think the because the installation distro sees an EFI partition on the source of installation media then it's automatically assuming that this is going to be EFI installation which later ends up meeting an old DOS filesystem on the destination hdd
Mar 13 20:13:04 <JanC>	https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/html_node/set.html
Mar 13 20:14:18 <librton>	so yes, there is no issue with both distro iso(s) and using an imaged usb with dd may solve the issue
Mar 13 20:41:23 <librton>	tried couple of other failing distros but slackware seems to getting it
Mar 13 20:42:07 <librton>	viva la alto penguino

On a Ubuntu 22.04 Gnome Xorg session it works prefectly, on a Wayland session I sometimes see bitflips in the data I get. I can reproduce this reliably and it is not arch specific, I can reproduce it on arm and x86.

Mar 14 10:57:23 <makara2>	hi. I've left it a bit late and now I can't seem to update from lobster to minotaur. What do I need to do?
Mar 14 10:58:33 <ravage>	!eolupgrade | makara2
Mar 14 10:58:33 <ubottu>	makara2: End-Of-Life is when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop. Make sure to update Ubuntu before it goes EOL so you get updates promptly for newly-discovered security vulnerabilities. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOL and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more info. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
Mar 14 10:59:49 <yziquel>	makara1 I did manage to upgrade cleanly from lunar to minotaur recently.
Mar 14 11:00:05 <yziquel>	makara1 like max two weeks ago.
Mar 14 11:00:08 <ravage>	you could also give 24.04 an early try with a fresh installation. but keep in mind that is not released yet and must expect bugs
Mar 14 11:00:31 <yziquel>	makara2
Mar 14 11:00:51 <makara2>	great. Thank you. Bookmarked
Mar 14 11:11:05 <makara2>	i get `E: The repository 'https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lunar Release' does not have a Release file.`
Mar 14 11:11:18 <makara2>	or `E: The repository 'http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lunar Release' does not have a Release file.`
Mar 14 11:12:07 <ravage>	https://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/ still exists
Mar 14 11:12:14 <ravage>	you dont need to change the sources yet
Mar 14 11:12:46 <ravage>	i mean http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/ without the s 🙂
Mar 14 11:13:20 <ravage>	you should be able to use the main server to get updates for lunar
Mar 14 11:14:25 <makara2>	ok I'll try that. But its clear from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases that lobster is EOL and yet there are no entries for it in http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/
Mar 14 12:05:18 <aiena>	In some screen shots (maybe older) I see the gnome option to add "WIndows printer via SAMBA" but I cannot find that option I am using ubuntu 22.04
Mar 14 12:06:03 <aiena>	how do I get this option in gnome I can see it in the cups web UI and can almost get it to work that way but dont know how to specify authentication. Was hoping configuring it via gnome might make it easier
Mar 14 12:06:34 <aiena>	I am refering to as seen here https://askubuntu.com/questions/1075251/how-to-connect-to-a-network-samba-printer-in-ubuntu
Mar 14 12:06:41 <aiena>	any ideas how to do this in 22.04?
Mar 14 12:07:31 <ravage>	did you try "Add printer" in the system settings?
Mar 14 12:07:44 <aiena>	yes it does not give me the multiple options specified there
Mar 14 12:07:54 <ravage>	you can just enter any network address thats supported there. it usually also just detects all LAN printers
Mar 14 12:08:06 <aiena>	I don't know how to get that dialog with multiple printer options
Mar 14 12:08:59 <aiena>	it does n ot list my printer but using smblient I can see it
Mar 14 12:09:38 <aiena>	I am ok with using the cups webUI but don't know how to make cups at least ask for auth or specify auth directly
Mar 14 12:10:53 <aiena>	hmm
Mar 14 12:13:30 <ravage>	i dont have any printer connected and im on 24.04 already. but maybe the part about authentication here is useful: https://wiki.itrss.mst.edu/dokuwiki/pub/install_samba_printers
Mar 14 12:17:33 <aiena>	ravage, thanks I am trying that. The gnome wizard managed to list my printer but cups fails with the auth required message
Mar 14 12:17:38 <aiena>	so trying your suggestion
Mar 14 13:22:42 <RickyRat5005>	Hello all. I have been asked to "enabling debug messages with these kernel parameters:
Mar 14 13:22:42 <RickyRat5005>	  drm.debug=0xff loglevel=8" I'm not sure how do do this.
Mar 14 13:27:18 <tomreyn>	!bootparm | RickyRat5005
Mar 14 13:27:43 <tomreyn>	!kernelparm | RickyRat5005
Mar 14 13:27:43 <ubottu>	RickyRat5005: To add a one-time or permanent kernel boot parameter see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBootParameters
Mar 14 13:29:17 <RickyRat5005>	Do I just put that line in anywhere in /etc/default/grub ?
Mar 14 13:30:17 <RickyRat5005>	!pastebin
Mar 14 13:30:18 <ubottu>	For posting multi-line texts into the channel, please use https://dpaste.com | To post !screenshots use https://imgur.com | !pastebinit to paste directly from command line | Make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic.
Mar 14 13:30:55 <tomreyn>	RickyRat5005: you add it to the end of the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line, separated by a blank space from what's already there, before the trailing double quote '"'
Mar 14 13:31:09 <tomreyn>	and run    sudo update-grub
Mar 14 13:33:04 <tomreyn>	so if you currently have    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="somethingelse quiet splash"    then you make it    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="somethingelse drm.debug=0xff loglevel=8"
Mar 14 13:33:19 <RickyRat5005>	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="drm.debug=0xff loglevel=8"
Mar 14 13:33:28 <RickyRat5005>	It's empty now.
Mar 14 13:33:35 <tomreyn>	(you'd remove "quiet" and "splash" for debugging)
Mar 14 13:34:17 <tomreyn>	the line you just posted should be fine
Mar 14 13:35:49 <RickyRat5005>	ok, thank you.
Mar 14 13:36:17 <RickyRat5005>	I think I did it right!
Mar 14 13:41:37 <tomreyn>	RickyRat5005: cat /proc/cmdline    would show

Mar 14 13:58:59 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Mar 14 14:49:41 <Elliria>	I could be wrong, but I'm under the impression that the Firefox Snap is a direct connection between Mozilla and us and is a way to bypass the operating system's way of updating. My friend's Snap and my Snap update automatically. My friend uses Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and his Firefox Snap is at revision 3936. I use Kubuntu 22.04 LTS and my Firefox Snap is at revision 3836. When I asked about that, he said that Ubuntu updates better than Kubuntu.
Mar 14 14:49:42 <Elliria>	Is that true or is there some other reason why our Firefox Snaps are at different revisions?
Mar 14 14:52:26 <ogra_>	Elliria, as you noted, snaps are completely distinct from the host OS ... so they should be on the same revision ... that said, the firefox snap uses phased updates so the rollout goes in chunks and not to everyone at the same time ... also note that revisions differ between architectures
Mar 14 14:57:03 <Elliria>	Ah, okay. He's using ARM64 and I'm using x86. He also looked at the Firefox version rather than the revision and it looks like I've got version 123.0 and he has 123.0.1. Interesting.
Mar 14 14:58:48 <ogra_>	i see rev 3936 on arm64 in the latest/stable channel ...
Mar 14 14:59:21 <ogra_>	and 3941 on amd64 ... both using the 123.0.1-1 version string
Mar 14 15:00:31 <ogra_>	(note that channels can also have different revisions, so it matters which channel you are tracking for a snap)
Mar 14 15:01:30 <Elliria>	How do you know which channel you're tracking and is that controllable?
Mar 14 15:01:51 <ogra_>	snap info firefox ... looks at the "tracking:" line
Mar 14 15:02:42 <ogra_>	you can always use snap refresh to switch to a different channel (see "snap refresh --help" ... and in general you should take a look at "snap help", snaps have many useful builtin features)
Mar 14 15:03:20 <Elliria>	Interesting. Mine is: latest/stable/ubuntu-22.04
Mar 14 15:03:50 <Elliria>	I'll have to ask what his is just out of curiosity at this point. We kind of like to geek out and examine our operating systems for the heck of it.
Mar 14 15:04:04 <ogra_>	😄
Mar 14 15:05:04 <Elliria>	These 'buntus are fascinating creatures and can do so very much that they're endlessly entertaining when it comes to figuring them out.
Mar 14 15:26:17 <iconoclast_hero>	https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/8654678/initial-lag-when-starting-to-scroll-with-hardware-acceleration-enabled?hl=en
Mar 14 15:26:29 <iconoclast_hero>	is there a way to disable GPU switching as described here?
Mar 14 15:28:09 <iconoclast_hero>	i.e., i'm trying to get at a solution similar to this one: "To stop the initial scroll lag caused by the graphics switching between GPUs try the following (in Windows 10). You can still leave hardware acceleration on in Chrome but just fix the system to one graphics card. To do this, type or search "display settings" from the start menu (or right click the desktop and select it). Then at the bottom select "Graphics settings".
Mar 14 15:28:09 <iconoclast_hero>	 I used  the "Classic app" setting and browsed for Chrome in program files. Then I changed the options from "System default" to "Power saving" though you can try "High performance" if you like but my Intel 630 integrated GPU was able to drive video in 4K at 60 fps no problem so did not need to use the high performance nvidia GPU. This should give smooth video with hardware acceleration but stop the initial scroll lag. However
Mar 14 15:28:09 <iconoclast_hero>	, It may not stop other forms of scroll lag. You may also be able to assign a specific GPU to an app using other Intel or nvidia apps under Control Panel."
Mar 14 15:28:39 <iconoclast_hero>	it seems that disabling HW switching in chrome as helped with the problem, but i'd like to take a crack at it from this direction as well
Mar 14 15:28:59 <iconoclast_hero>	$ uname -a Linux < > 6.7.6-060706-generic #202402230933 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Feb 23 09:43:37 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Mar 14 15:29:32 <ogra_>	well, first of all you should switch to a proper kernel ... this one is not supported
Mar 14 15:29:49 <ogra_>	(i'm surprised your nvidia driver would even work with this)
Mar 14 15:30:32 <Daniel>	I have a live cd cd-rom added to a server with ubuntu 22.04, I am using apt-cdrom ident, it sees it, I can manually mount it but apt-cdrom add failes with no cd-rom could be autodetected
Mar 14 15:32:09 <Daniel>	fails
Mar 14 15:38:01 <iconoclast_hero>	wrong machine
Mar 14 15:38:20 <iconoclast_hero>	$ uname -a Linux < > 6.5.0-21-generic #21~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Feb  9 13:32:52 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Mar 14 15:39:41 <iconoclast_hero>	should it matter, screenfetch reports GPU: Intel Corporation UHD Graphics 620 (rev 07) Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-LP Integrated Sensor Hub (rev 21)
Mar 14 15:40:47 <iconoclast_hero>	also what i pasted inre an nvidia card is someone else's example trying to resolve the issue with chrome on Windows...doesn't apply to me as I have neither nvidia nor microsoft.
Mar 14 15:41:08 <iconoclast_hero>	i do have chrome on linux though and the scroll lag is hella annoying.
Mar 14 15:42:11 <iconoclast_hero>	so what I'm trying to do is apparently adjust the switching between graphics modes in Ubuntu similar to what was done in that quotation in windows.
Mar 14 15:56:48 <plastikman>	So youo dont have 2 graphics chips?
Mar 14 16:00:05 <ogra_>	iconoclast_hero, what they describe is the driver switch between intel and nvidia on a hybrid card ... if you dont have such a card you can obviously not swithc between the two hybrid cores in it ...
Mar 14 16:00:43 <iconoclast_hero>	i have a problem with chrome lagging.
Mar 14 16:00:50 <plastikman>	Please dont post another massive wall of text, but it woudl be helpful to post some details about your machine
Mar 14 16:00:57 <iconoclast_hero>	this is a solution that has worked for someone.
Mar 14 16:01:11 <plastikman>	with a totally different setup than you
Mar 14 16:01:29 <iconoclast_hero>	plastikman how to I solve the scrolling issue with my setup?
Mar 14 16:01:46 <plastikman>	well, since i have no idea what your setup is, i cant help.
Mar 14 16:01:48 <leftyfb>	iconoclast_hero: does the problem happen with firefox?
Mar 14 16:01:49 <iconoclast_hero>	telling me things i already know doesn't help much.
Mar 14 16:01:56 <iconoclast_hero>	i don't use firefox
Mar 14 16:02:03 <plastikman>	that is not what was asked
Mar 14 16:02:05 <iconoclast_hero>	i've uninstalled it where possible
Mar 14 16:02:13 <leftyfb>	sudo snap install firefox
Mar 14 16:02:16 <leftyfb>	use it to test
Mar 14 16:02:22 <leftyfb>	remove it when we are done testing
Mar 14 16:03:14 <iconoclast_hero>	ok, while i take care of that, what is a fair test?
Mar 14 16:03:36 <leftyfb>	iconoclast_hero: replicate the issue on firefox
Mar 14 16:03:36 <iconoclast_hero>	i have quite a few tabs in chrome open, but they should be put to sleep
Mar 14 16:03:59 <leftyfb>	define "quite a few"
Mar 14 16:04:07 <iconoclast_hero>	i had an extension that did that before chrome implemented it and i turned that feature on
Mar 14 16:04:11 <iconoclast_hero>	dozens
Mar 14 16:04:38 <iconoclast_hero>	probably less than 100
Mar 14 16:05:16 <leftyfb>	I also have somewhere between 50 and 100 tabs
Mar 14 16:05:33 <iconoclast_hero>	also firefox isn't lagging with one tab open
Mar 14 16:05:35 <iconoclast_hero>	and i opened...
Mar 14 16:05:38 <leftyfb>	I don't think the number of tabs, especially if they're sleeping, it going to affect the scrolling
Mar 14 16:05:42 <iconoclast_hero>	https://getpocket.com/collections/can-you-really-improve-your-breathing-yes-you-can?utm_source=pocket-newtab-en-us
Mar 14 16:05:56 <leftyfb>	ok, now try chromium
Mar 14 16:06:06 <iconoclast_hero>	i don't think quantity of open tabs will cause an issue either but i thought i'd menton it.
Mar 14 16:06:12 <iconoclast_hero>	apt install chromium?
Mar 14 16:06:19 <ogra_>	snap ...
Mar 14 16:11:27 <iconoclast_hero>	with a single tab open, the lagging is not happening in chromium either.
Mar 14 16:11:52 <leftyfb>	iconoclast_hero: try opening a private window in google chrome
Mar 14 16:12:05 <leftyfb>	incognito mode
Mar 14 16:12:31 <iconoclast_hero>	yeah
Mar 14 16:13:09 <leftyfb>	can you replicate the issue in a new incognito mode window?
Mar 14 16:13:10 <iconoclast_hero>	don't observe an issue, but chrome has the HW acceleration turned off
Mar 14 16:13:46 <leftyfb>	ok, then the issue is more than likely with an extension you have installed or something wrong with your profile
Mar 14 16:13:46 <jars99>	I've been having a problem with Ubuntu 22.04: The Sharing: Remote Desktop Password isn't getting remembered.  Every time I go in there to see if it's set correctly, it's set to some new, random string.  Has anyone else seen this issue?  I don't seem to have it on my 23.10 system
Mar 14 16:15:03 <iconoclast_hero>	leftyfb, there's two variables there.
Mar 14 16:15:16 <leftyfb>	2 potential causes
Mar 14 16:15:50 <iconoclast_hero>	until i turn the HW Acceeration back on, restart chrome, replicate the scrolling issue, then open the incognito window, i haven't ruled anything out.
Mar 14 16:16:03 <iconoclast_hero>	but i have another place to look when it happens again.
Mar 14 16:16:46 <leftyfb>	iconoclast_hero: wait, are you saying everything is fine when you disable HW acceleration regardless of being in incognito mode?
Mar 14 16:17:06 <iconoclast_hero>	this has been going on for a long time.
Mar 14 16:17:19 <iconoclast_hero>	months, maybe 12 of them?
Mar 14 16:17:37 <leftyfb>	iconoclast_hero: please answer the question
Mar 14 16:17:48 <iconoclast_hero>	i looked into it today and saw that there are a couple of ways to address it.
Mar 14 16:17:48 <iconoclast_hero>	one of them is to turn off the acceleration in chrome.
Mar 14 16:17:55 <iconoclast_hero>	i did that and it seemed to solve the problem.
Mar 14 16:18:01 <leftyfb>	yay!
Mar 14 16:18:10 <iconoclast_hero>	as I said, I want to try this other method mentioned in the post
Mar 14 16:18:25 <leftyfb>	why? You already solved the problem
Mar 14 16:18:28 <iconoclast_hero>	see if there's a difference, you know the ol' A B testing
Mar 14 16:18:43 <iconoclast_hero>	thoroughness?
Mar 14 16:18:53 <iconoclast_hero>	see if the other solution is preferable?
Mar 14 16:19:04 <ashafq>	Firefox on snap doesn't open any file dialog. Is xdg-portal broken on Ubuntu 22.04?
Mar 14 16:19:22 <ashafq>	Is there some permissions missing from snap on firefox?
Mar 14 16:19:40 <iconoclast_hero>	if you go back to what i said at the beginning, i pretty clearly stated that, "it seems that disabling HW switching in chrome as helped with the problem, but i'd like to take a crack at it from this direction as well"
Mar 14 16:19:47 <ashafq>	or install xdg-desktop-portal-gnome?
Mar 14 16:20:32 <leftyfb>	ashafq: are you running Firefox over SSH?
Mar 14 16:20:58 <ashafq>	leftyfb: no
Mar 14 16:22:16 <ashafq>	leftyfb: firefox on gnome session (wayland)
Mar 14 16:23:58 <ogra_>	the default gnome desktop should have the right portals installed
Mar 14 16:24:46 <jars99>	Has anyone else had issues with the built-in Remote Desktop password on 22.04?
Mar 14 16:26:18 <tomreyn>	the answer to this question should be available on launchpad.net
Mar 14 16:27:51 <tomreyn>	somewhere over here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-remote-desktop
Mar 14 16:29:24 <tomreyn>	jars99: if your issue is not yet reported there, you could run    ubuntu-bug gnome-remote-desktop   to file a bug yourself.
Mar 14 16:29:40 <jars99>	ok, thanks
Mar 14 16:29:42 <iconoclast_hero>	on a different front: i have a ram drive/cache and initially i wanted that to exist when the machine started but that evolved to saving the contents on shutdown/reboot and restoring the contents upon restart.
Mar 14 16:29:42 <iconoclast_hero>	i wrote two scripts (though i can probably combine them), the restore/dir create script is here: https://pastebin.com/raw/Bsnh4WBr
Mar 14 16:30:02 <tomreyn>	jars99: please make sure your system is fully updated before you do.
Mar 14 16:30:10 <jars99>	will do
Mar 14 16:30:33 <iconoclast_hero>	if i just symlink that script to /etc/rc3.d/S01restorecache without the info block at the beginning, will it just run at startup as is?
Mar 14 16:30:39 <iconoclast_hero>	(assuming +x)
Mar 14 16:31:16 <iconoclast_hero>	and is there no rc.local in ubuntu or does that created from scratch in every install?
Mar 14 16:32:49 <tomreyn>	ubuntu uses systemd, you should learn how to use it rather than trying to do things the old way.
Mar 14 16:33:53 <iconoclast_hero>	thank you tomreyn, buy my questions are still unanswered.
Mar 14 16:35:00 <failer0>	wh
Mar 14 16:35:10 <failer0>	anyone here?
Mar 14 16:37:11 <leftyfb>	iconoclast_hero: use a systemd unit
Mar 14 16:37:50 <iconoclast_hero>	maybe i'm asking the wrong questions.
Mar 14 16:37:57 <iconoclast_hero>	how do I not use systemd to do this?
Mar 14 16:38:14 <iconoclast_hero>	i just want to run a script and not figure out a whole system process.
Mar 14 16:39:04 <iconoclast_hero>	the problem isn't even system d.
Mar 14 16:39:27 <leftyfb>	iconoclast_hero: it's really not that difficult. https://medium.com/@benmorel/creating-a-linux-service-with-systemd-611b5c8b91d6
Mar 14 16:39:47 <leftyfb>	iconoclast_hero: Sysv is considered deprecated
Mar 14 16:40:00 <iconoclast_hero>	it's difficult when i have to re-learn how to do it every time.
Mar 14 16:40:10 <iconoclast_hero>	i just want to run a f'n script.
Mar 14 16:40:20 <iconoclast_hero>	i don't want to know what all the system details are.
Mar 14 16:40:24 <iconoclast_hero>	autoexec.bat
Mar 14 16:40:44 <leftyfb>	and I gave you a tutorial on how to do it
Mar 14 16:42:29 <plastikman>	iconoclast_hero: systemd is here to stay, learn it.  if you dont want systemd then check out one of the others taht dont use it
Mar 14 16:42:32 <iconoclast_hero>	i just want to run a script.
Mar 14 16:42:47 <tanath>	i think this is easier/simpler to follow https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/User#Writing_user_units
Mar 14 16:42:52 <preach>	tomreyn: leftyfb: iconoclast_hero: ubuntu already comes with a rc-local.service unit that enables running /etc/rc.local on startup as long as it's chmod +x
Mar 14 16:43:05 <preach>	no need to learn anything
Mar 14 16:43:14 <iconoclast_hero>	BINGO.
Mar 14 16:43:28 <akik>	systemd will remove sysv init script support soon
Mar 14 16:43:39 <preach>	oh hi akik
Mar 14 16:43:47 <preach>	long time no see
Mar 14 16:43:49 <leftyfb>	you better hope your script doesn't lock up, because if it does, your system will fail to finish booting
Mar 14 16:44:05 <leftyfb>	rc.local is not a good idea for such things
Mar 14 16:44:06 <akik>	i tried talking to lennart to keep rc.local but he wasn't in the mood
Mar 14 16:44:23 <preach>	not surprised
Mar 14 16:44:27 <tomreyn>	preach: that's a less than ideal compatibility layer, i'd say, and thus don't recommend.
Mar 14 16:44:56 <preach>	leftyfb: Type=forking ftw
Mar 14 16:45:22 <preach>	tomreyn: it's no different than making one yourself, I see no problem with it. people can always copy the old unit if it does get removed
Mar 14 16:45:40 <leftyfb>	preach: you don't even need that in a normal service file if nothing is dependent on your custom script
Mar 14 16:45:44 <preach>	"using systemd" is still the same as making your own identical rc-local.service anyway.
Mar 14 16:45:58 <preach>	so complaining about having an rc-local.service is silly IMO
Mar 14 16:46:24 <iconoclast_hero>	hey preach...  if i leave off that info block in that script in rc3.d will it still run at startup?
Mar 14 16:46:32 <tanath>	iconoclast_hero: if you're going to continue using linux, some systemd familiarity is worth learning. systemd is basically everywhere, and the non-systemd options are not as user-friendly
Mar 14 16:46:33 <iconoclast_hero>	i just really want to know the answer to that question.
Mar 14 16:46:45 <iconoclast_hero>	right, i have written systemd stuff
Mar 14 16:46:47 <iconoclast_hero>	i'll show you
Mar 14 16:46:49 <akik>	and rc.local in systemd isn't even being ran last
Mar 14 16:47:16 <leftyfb>	iconoclast_hero: in the time you originally asked the question, you could have easily tested it and come to a conclusion
Mar 14 16:47:23 <iconoclast_hero>	https://github.com/iconoclasthero/mpdignore
Mar 14 16:47:28 <preach>	iconoclast_hero: sorry I missed that part of the conversation, not sure what you're referring to
Mar 14 16:47:33 <leftyfb>	or written and enabled your own systemd unit file
Mar 14 16:47:37 <iconoclast_hero>	there's a systemd process i've made, it's not the point.
Mar 14 16:47:39 <preach>	leftyfb: no need to be rude
Mar 14 16:47:56 <iconoclast_hero>	i asked a question so that i could learn something about a subject i was interested in and the answer was your question is wrong
Mar 14 16:48:13 <preach>	iconoclast_hero: that's typical IRC unfortunately
Mar 14 16:48:20 <iconoclast_hero>	@preach https://pastebin.com/raw/Bsnh4WBr
Mar 14 16:48:22 <preach>	everyone always asks the wrong question, whether that's true or not
Mar 14 16:49:03 <preach>	and if you want to do something in a way others don't agree with, you're still asking the wrong question
Mar 14 16:49:17 <iconoclast_hero>	and @leftyfb, i'm really trying hard not to reboot that system right now.
Mar 14 16:49:31 <iconoclast_hero>	otherwise i wouldn't've asked.
Mar 14 16:49:34 <leftyfb>	iconoclast_hero: how do you expect to test your script on boot?
Mar 14 16:49:36 <preach>	iconoclast_hero: if you're using systemd then yea that block does nothing
Mar 14 16:49:41 <preach>	that's for an older init system
Mar 14 16:51:37 <preach>	if they don't want to reboot then they aren't interested in "testing it at boot" right now, simple as
Mar 14 16:52:03 <iconoclast_hero>	wow, preach, have you ever watched key and peale?
Mar 14 16:52:08 <iconoclast_hero>	i need you to be my luther.
Mar 14 16:52:20 <preach>	I refuse to watch
Mar 14 16:52:44 <preach>	they basically took chappelle's show and made it worse
Mar 14 16:52:57 <iconoclast_hero>	well, if you wish to understand the reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkAK9QRe4ds
Mar 14 16:53:26 <preach>	and I just don't like them I don't think they're funny :/ but to each their own
Mar 14 16:54:46 <iconoclast_hero>	well, thanks for answering the questions i asked.  i appreciate that people are trying to help, but there's a point at which you're not doing anyone any good arguing about which solution to use
Mar 14 16:55:01 <iconoclast_hero>	all this systemd discussion was a waste of everyone's time.  just answer the question asked.
Mar 14 16:55:30 <preach>	iconoclast_hero: 1000% agree
Mar 14 16:56:00 <preach>	terminally online linux nerds are often jaded and elitist
Mar 14 16:57:07 <iconoclast_hero>	this happened to me when I was trying to stop a gravity loop in a domestic hot water recirculation loop
Mar 14 16:57:27 <iconoclast_hero>	the discussion became about whether it was cromulent to return the water to the base of the HW tank or not.
Mar 14 16:58:46 <tomreyn>	we would not be doing you or us any good if we were to invest time into telling you how you can make something work with outdated, soon-to-be-unsupported (and already likely to break things) approaches which don't fit current mechanisms used in ubuntu.
Mar 14 17:00:19 <tomreyn>	(and considering *this* elitist is a misinterpretation, i would say.)
Mar 14 17:00:49 <leftyfb>	and against CoC
Mar 14 17:01:11 <iconoclast_hero>	if it is a system that is currently functional in ubuntu then it is still a supported system regardless of plans that have not yet come to fruition to eliminate it.
Mar 14 17:01:39 <plastikman>	Im not sure any of this is even helpful.
Mar 14 17:01:59 <iconoclast_hero>	it isn't.  i really tried hard not to respond.
Mar 14 17:02:53 <akik>	it's schrödinger's startup script
Mar 14 17:04:41 <preach>	23:58 < tomreyn> we would not be doing you or us any good <- I disagree, if someone doesn't want to learn a different method _right now_, it's not your place to try to convince them when they obviously don't want to be. I think you do more harm than good by arguing about it.
Mar 14 17:06:14 <leftyfb>	preach: except when they come back here in a couple years after sysV has been completely deprecated asking why their script stopped working. It happens all the time. It's really fun having the same conversation and troubleshooting the same problem with the same person multiple times
Mar 14 17:06:43 <plastikman>	I mean, systemd _just_ came out.
Mar 14 17:06:49 <leftyfb>	preach: also, I consider it my place to provide support the way I feel the most beneficial to everyone
Mar 14 17:07:14 <leftyfb>	plastikman: Ubuntu moved to systemd in 2015
Mar 14 17:07:21 <plastikman>	leftyfb: it was a joke.
Mar 14 17:07:32 <plastikman>	that means its been 9 year.
Mar 14 17:08:01 <leftyfb>	it's been almost 10 years. Yes, I believe telling people to learn systemd over sysV to solve a problem is the right method of support
Mar 14 17:08:11 <preach>	leftyfb: arguing fundamental things like this when they tell you they're not interested though, gets nobody anywhere, now OR later
Mar 14 17:08:29 <preach>	you don't have to respond if you aren't interested in helping them with the way they want to do it
Mar 14 17:08:37 <preach>	that's no reason to tell them they're wrong
Mar 14 17:09:25 <preach>	yes you can say you should learn systemd, but if they say they're not interested, I think you should leave it at that if you don't want to help them with the way they want to do it
Mar 14 17:09:38 <preach>	all this arguing is pointless
Mar 14 17:09:40 <leftyfb>	you provide support the way you choose
Mar 14 17:09:43 <preach>	and just turns people off to even asking for help
Mar 14 17:09:51 <tomreyn>	preach: iconoclast has previously been very reluctant to adopt current mechanisms, and has been seeking support about outdated mechanisms here. that's not something we forbid, but something we should discourage and instead tell about the current mechanisms to enable them to have a good ubuntu experience IMO. we can continue this conversation in #ubuntu-offtopic, if you would like to.
Mar 14 17:10:03 <preach>	I think way more people are turned away from irc support channels than those who inconvenience you by not wanting to learn systemd
Mar 14 17:10:26 <preach>	simply due to people's attitudes
Mar 14 17:11:00 <preach>	anyway I've said my 2c
Mar 14 17:45:48 <ashafq>	leftyfb: have I misconfigured firefox snap somehow?
Mar 14 17:48:08 <leftyfb>	ashafq: I'm not sure. I have a semi-similar problem but in my case, I run google-chrome over X forwarding (with xorg of course) and when it opens a dialog, the dialog opens on the target machine, not over X forwarding
Mar 14 17:49:32 <ashafq>	leftyfb: :(

Mar 14 23:56:30 <eelstrebor>	is there something wrong with the repositories? apt update shows updates available but apt upgrade can't seem to get them
Mar 14 23:57:12 <oerheks>	nope https://status.canonical.com/
Mar 14 23:57:29 <jeremy31>	Some must be working as I am updating now

Mar 15 00:01:02 <eelstrebor>	snap-store update - Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified
Mar 15 00:01:02 <ubottu>	Since Ubuntu 21.04, APT may hold back some updates on some systems while they are being phased in. This is called "phased updates". See https://ubottu.com/y/phased and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PhasedUpdates for more info.
Mar 15 00:01:39 <eelstrebor>	krytarik, that's not my issue
Mar 15 00:02:00 <krytarik>	Just typo correcting here. :P
Mar 15 00:02:23 <tomreyn>	"Connection failed [IP: 91.189.91.39 80]" suggests that your system (the one looking for updates) resolved security.ubuntu.com as 91.189.91.39 but was unable to setup a TCP connection to the HTTP port (80) on 91.189.91.39
Mar 15 00:02:46 <oerheks>	maybe the server was just in sync, try again?
Mar 15 00:03:54 <eelstrebor>	i've been trying for 2 days
Mar 15 00:04:00 <tomreyn>	security.ubuntu.com resolves (slightly) differently for me, but this is likely just due to it being a CDN
Mar 15 00:04:16 <tomreyn>	try using httpS rather than httP
Mar 15 00:05:19 <tomreyn>	ah no, it does not seem to support HTTPS
Mar 15 00:06:28 <eelstrebor>	https has been working for me for several months
Mar 15 00:06:40 <oerheks>	change to main, and try again?
Mar 15 00:06:50 <tomreyn>	eelstrebor: for security.ubuntu.com?
Mar 15 00:07:43 <oerheks>	does this file exist? cat /var/run/reboot-required
Mar 15 00:09:31 <krytarik>	You know, it is mildly curious that "apt update" does seem connect to security.u.c successfully, but "apt upgrade" does not.
Mar 15 00:15:01 <tomreyn>	do we know that "apt update" connected to security.u.c successfully, though? i haven't seen output suggesting so.
Mar 15 00:15:40 <tomreyn>	oh they're gone
Mar 15 00:15:46 <krytarik>	Well, the package URL is current at least.
Mar 15 00:16:28 <tomreyn>	this one has probably been current since 2021 ;)
Mar 15 00:16:59 <krytarik>	lol
Mar 15 00:19:53 <tomreyn>	no, you're right, this one was just packaged two days ago

Mar 15 08:27:12 <toddc>	wrong looking
Mar 15 08:28:06 <ravage>	i think its !alis 🙂
Mar 15 08:28:44 <Unit193>	Or, you could actually just talk to the user.  But he's gone.
Mar 15 08:43:27 <Guest453>	hi
Mar 15 08:43:58 <Guest453>	with the 'mktemp' program are the temporary dirrects semi permanent or on reboot they are lost?
Mar 15 10:03:11 <jakubby>	Hey amd calls for `linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)` to use RoCM. Is there anyway to always install the extra-modules for the most current kernel? Like is the case with kernel headers?
Mar 15 10:03:33 <jakubby>	I don't want things to break just because of some lacking module interdependency
Mar 15 10:04:07 <jakubby>	linux-modules-extra-generic doesn't exist and quick inspection with tabulator shows that only linux-modules-extra-<version>-generic exists
Mar 15 10:04:24 <jakubby>	ubuntu 22.04
Mar 15 10:05:03 <ravage>	if you use the generic kernel which is the default then thats the package you need
Mar 15 10:07:16 <ogra_>	just make sure to install linux-generic ... thats the metapackage that pulls in everything (i.e. the linux-image-generic package ... which in turn depends on linux-modules-extra-$VERSION-generic)
Mar 15 10:07:44 <jakubby>	I see had no idea it works like that, thanks
