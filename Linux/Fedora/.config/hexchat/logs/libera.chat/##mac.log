Feb 21 11:21:19 <Brains>	Why the big windage, akrawt1?
Feb 21 11:22:51 <akrawt1>	a bit tired of dealing with this older piece of hw that doesnt work as it should :P
Feb 21 11:23:29 <Brains>	Oh? What are you fighting with/on?
Feb 21 12:13:56 <akrawt1>	well I got this old audiofire audio interface, which seems has too old firmware version to run on modern hw/sw
Feb 21 12:14:49 <akrawt1>	it seems in order to update it to the next firmware version , from where I will have more options for updating it to the newest available  I need some old set of hw with firewire port and win xp or like macos tiger or something
Feb 21 12:15:13 <akrawt1>	not even sure which macos it would need in that case. was gonna look for the used market, for some ancient mac mini or smth :)
Feb 21 12:16:22 <href>	maybe use a vm? afaik you can run old macoses this way
Feb 21 12:20:48 <akrawt1>	well yeah I was askig about it early. after brief googling it seemed like a task with little chances for success
Feb 21 12:20:59 <akrawt1>	Im not even sure how to vm properly on macs
Feb 21 12:21:39 <akrawt1>	especially considering I need firewire being available in the vm somehow
Feb 21 12:22:01 <akrawt1>	using tb2fw converter for now. on this macbook air 2017
Feb 21 12:23:15 <akrawt1>	early=earlier
Feb 21 12:23:56 <akrawt1>	good thing is that I see plenty of used macs/pcs with firewire even locally
Feb 21 12:24:24 <akrawt1>	so should be able to grab one quick enough when it gets clear which os/hw has more chances to success in this task
Feb 21 12:26:31 <href>	parallels and vmware can do that iirc. and they should support doing the passthrough of the interface
Feb 21 12:26:56 <href>	anyway even on older macos getting an audiofire to run isn't a fun task, struggled about that like 4-5 years ago
Feb 21 12:28:43 <href>	... and when i managed to, the interface died a couple of weeks later lol
Feb 21 12:31:40 <akrawt1>	lol
Feb 21 12:31:57 <akrawt1>	yeah I dont have much experience with firewire on macs, but been using it on windows since like 2005
Feb 21 12:41:39 <Brains>	akrawt1: The Echo stuff has been out of support for a long time; you'll need an older Mac with FW800 onboard, running no higher than OS X 10.6.8
Feb 21 12:42:02 <Brains>	(Unfortunately, this audio engineer needs to log out & catch the bus!)
Feb 21 12:46:57 <akrawt1>	lol thanks br
Feb 21 12:47:00 <akrawt1>	oh hs gone
Feb 21 12:47:03 <akrawt1>	that was helpful tho!
Feb 21 12:47:25 <href>	it works after 10.6.8 tho
Feb 21 12:47:38 <akrawt1>	well yeah, if your device firmware is something higher then the very first one
Feb 21 12:47:43 <akrawt1>	at least what it seems like to me
Feb 21 12:47:57 <akrawt1>	because Im usccessfuly using same model line device since like 2006
Feb 21 12:48:02 <akrawt1>	but I just kept it up to date
Feb 21 12:48:53 <akrawt1>	so I have 2 thoughts on this. wether this device is indeed on the very first firmware version and doesnt work properly under modernish hw/sw OR it's firmware/flashmemory is somehow corrupt
Feb 21 12:50:44 <akrawt1>	gonna look for the nearest and cheapest mac that matches my criteria :D
Feb 21 12:50:58 <akrawt1>	fw800 and macos under 10.6.8
Feb 21 13:09:27 <Brains>	akrawt1: Home, and  I've a few minutes to spare.
Feb 21 13:10:39 <Brains>	That AudioFire is PowerPC-era stuff, so unless you're prepared to use an older Mac with an older OS X, you'd be better off selling it to a Windows user, as there's some hobbyist-level support.
Feb 21 13:12:11 <Brains>	Depending on which AudioFire it is - say, its a 12 & not a 4, you should be able to use it with Mavericks (10.9.5) and no higher. Snowkitty on a suitable Mac would be the sweet spot for the whole line.
Feb 21 13:12:52 <Brains>	And with that, I'm off again - I'll be around again in about 8 hours.
Feb 21 13:21:34 <akrawt1>	damn hes gone again :)
Feb 21 13:21:42 *	akrawt1 skims thru everymac filters

Feb 23 15:01:56 <maccampus>	 My Mac went into recoverymode & i noticed zsh was changed to bash. is Bash still the standard sh in recovery mode ? Why ?
Feb 23 18:28:48 <Capa>	didn't know bash was standard.
Feb 23 18:31:10 <href>	it was changed to zsh since a couple of releases. Funny that recovery still uses bash, maybe because it's a static one?
Feb 23 18:34:22 <Capa>	i'm fine w/ either
Feb 23 18:34:35 <Capa>	i barely spend any time in recovery anyways

Feb 24 18:30:01 <ball>	Do Apple have a service that's about $25/mo?  I'm trying to help someone make sense of their bank statement.
Feb 24 18:30:19 <ball>	My first thought was iCloud but they're on a $3/mo plan
Feb 24 18:46:53 <ball>	Ah never mind, they've figured it out apparently.
Feb 24 18:49:58 <ball>	I must resist the urge to buy an M1 mini.

Feb 25 03:04:49 <Al2O3>	or theft, or something
Feb 25 03:04:57 <Al2O3>	also sounds like they sell for about 5000 USD
Feb 25 03:15:52 <ball>	I should fire up my wife's 2014 mini to see whether that still boots.

Feb 25 04:06:21 <ball>	brb, switching thingummies...
Feb 25 04:23:23 <ball>	That's better.
Feb 25 04:43:42 <ball>	Is there a button to press to ask "Photos" to sync up?
