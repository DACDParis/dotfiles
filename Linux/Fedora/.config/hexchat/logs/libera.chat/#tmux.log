Dec 11 20:52:07 <mingdao>	What are the two pipes then tmux again for?
Dec 11 20:52:35 <mingdao>	tmux a = tmux attach, but does not specify a session if multiples are running.

Feb 20 18:49:45 <birkoff>	is there a simple way to get a list of all available key-tables ? 
Feb 20 18:56:06 <slim>	birkoff: list-keys or customize-mode
Feb 20 19:41:33 <voldial>	How do I `list-sessions -f` for only attached sessions? I have https://bpa.st/EG3A but it's listing them all. So... -f "#{m:session_attached,#{attached}}" must be incorrect...?
Feb 20 19:50:35 <voldial>	hm. I think I had that backwards... but it's still not matching with -f "#{m:attached,#{session_attached}}"
Feb 20 19:51:57 <depesz>	voldial: tbh, i'
Feb 20 19:52:03 <depesz>	i'd probably just grep :)
Feb 20 19:53:02 <slim>	just use #{session_attached}
Feb 20 19:53:19 <slim>	voldial: :ls -f '#{session_attached}'
Feb 20 19:55:36 <voldial>	slim: thx, maybe I'm still doing something wrong... it still lists both the attached and not attached sessions: https://bpa.st/BRMQ
Feb 20 19:58:03 <slim>	something in the -F format i assume, does ls -f '#{session_attached}' show only the attached sessions?
Feb 20 20:00:33 <voldial>	slim: aaah. yes. and now it works, I got rid of the single quote escaping
Feb 20 20:00:41 <voldial>	TY
Feb 20 20:01:17 <slim>	cheers
Feb 20 20:23:59 <ikke>	I'm using alacritty as terminal, and I'm trying to get hyperlinks to work. They are already working outside of tmux. set -g terminal-overrides ",alacritty:RGB"
Feb 20 20:24:04 <ikke>	Oops
Feb 20 20:24:16 <ikke>	From an issue I found the previous configuration option, but that does not help
Feb 20 20:24:51 <ikke>	I have set -g default-terminal tmux-256color (previously screen-256color)
Feb 20 20:25:01 <ikke>	Any idea what I might be missing to get it to work?
Feb 20 20:37:14 <slim>	ikke: do you have mouse enabled in tmux?
Feb 20 20:37:41 <voldial>	How do I do the opposite of `ls: -f '#{session_attached}'`? I tried inserting !, and read the FORMATS secion in the manpage... negation isnt mentioned afict
Feb 20 20:38:20 <ikke>	slim: hmm, apparently not

Feb 20 20:55:51 <slim>	ikke: did you restart the tmux server after adding that terminal-overrides to your tmux conf?
Feb 20 20:57:47 <slim>	may need to be killed and started again at the server level
Feb 20 20:59:33 <voldial>	ah. got it -f "#{==:#{session_attached},0}" (from https://stackoverflow.com/a/75040601)
Feb 20 21:05:38 <ikke>	slim: yes
Feb 20 21:12:01 <slim>	ikke: hrmm, not sure... hints seem to work out of the box with default configs for both tmux/alacritty on my side
Feb 20 21:12:07 <slim>	not sure what to suggest, sorry
Feb 20 21:24:49 <ikke>	Maybe I should look at what tcell (the terminal library) does
Feb 20 21:28:39 <slim>	maybe the #alacritty folks can help, or stick around and someone else may chime in eventually... i can't even break hints functionality
Feb 20 21:29:05 <slim>	ikke: just out of curiosity, what versions of tmux/alacritty ?
Feb 20 21:29:26 <ikke>	tmux 3.3a
Feb 20 21:29:34 <ikke>	alacritty 0.13.1 (fe2a3c56)
Feb 20 21:29:56 <ikke>	using `echo -e '\e]8;;http://example.com\aThis is a link\e]8;;\a'` confirms it's not just the library
Feb 20 21:31:00 <UndeadLeech>	If tmux emits the escapes, Alacritty will work. If Alacritty doesn't work, tmux probably isn't emitting the escapes.
Feb 20 21:32:19 <slim>	ooh THE alacritty folk ;)
Feb 20 21:32:21 <UndeadLeech>	Might need to manually enable it, maybe https://github.com/tmux/tmux/pull/3240 can help with that.
Feb 20 21:32:44 <UndeadLeech>	I don't use tmux so I'm not sure if it's enabled by default.
Feb 20 21:34:05 <ikke>	Someone  suggested 'set-option -ga terminal-features ",alacritty:hyperlinks"' in both the alacritty project as in the tmux project, but no dice
Feb 20 21:34:34 <UndeadLeech>	Is your TERM `alacritty`?
Feb 20 21:34:45 <UndeadLeech>	That does match https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda?permalink_comment_id=4412251#gistcomment-4412251 though.
Feb 20 21:35:26 <ikke>	UndeadLeech: Yes, outside of tmux
Feb 20 21:35:34 <ikke>	inside of tmux it's tmux-256color
Feb 20 21:35:43 <ikke>	(I did try it inside tmux as well, without result)
Feb 20 21:36:33 <ikke>	Let me use that one with a wildcard
Feb 20 21:37:55 <ikke>	no difference
Feb 20 21:39:27 <ikke>	I reduced my tmux config to a minimum to check if that fixed it, but no
Feb 20 21:45:11 <ikke>	https://tpaste.us/xyqv

Feb 20 21:58:04 <ikke>	In the tmux-server log, I see: removing term alacritty
Feb 20 21:58:36 <ikke>	That seems to indicate some error happened
Feb 20 21:59:04 <ikke>	"unknown terminal feature: hyperlinks"
Feb 20 22:10:00 <ikke>	Oh, apparently 3.3a does not have it yet :/

Feb 20 22:19:47 <birkoff>	running 'tmux -C' and typing inside 'refresh-client -C' causes tmux to crash down
Feb 20 22:21:28 <ikke>	slim: UndeadLeech upgrading tmux fixed it, thanks for the help!
Feb 20 23:06:54 <thomas_adam>	birkoff: Does it?  Is there a corefile?
Feb 20 23:08:13 <birkoff>	yes but it probably contains private stuff
Feb 20 23:14:36 <slim>	ikke: good stuff!
Feb 20 23:23:50 <birkoff>	here's the repeatable stack trace: https://dpaste.com/DH9VRYJRU 
Feb 20 23:26:09 <thomas_adam>	birkoff: Without debug symbols, that's useless.
Feb 20 23:27:03 <birkoff>	maybe you can instruct me how to debug it ?
Feb 20 23:27:28 <thomas_adam>	I can't reproduce the problem you're having though.
Feb 20 23:38:34 <voldial>	is there a way to have a indicator of what tmux process you are "on" when hitting ctrl-b? I ask because sometimes I'm nested 2 or 3 deep, and I can always hit "ctrl-b" 2x to command the 2nd nested tmux, but I cant seem to get that to work the 3rd time in the odd case that i'm nested 3 deep.
Feb 20 23:40:31 <VSpike>	I had a nice setup where the names of my panes in the status bar updated with current directory. This was using  a PROMPT_COMMAND in bash. It has stopped working and I can't figure out why. It works outside tmux still. Inside tmux, even just using printf directly to send the escape chars doesn't work .. I have `allow-rename on` and
Feb 20 23:40:32 <VSpike>	`automatic-rename off`. What could I be missing?
Feb 20 23:41:57 <VSpike>	Also, tmux config has always confused me. Are `setw`, `set-window-option` and `set -w` all equivalent?
Feb 20 23:43:06 <thomas_adam>	VSpike: Yeah -- the options table knows the context, so "set" is fine to use for all of them.
Feb 20 23:43:28 <birkoff>	thomas_adam: can I do anything with the coredump file myself ? 
Feb 20 23:43:29 <VSpike>	The docs seem to say to set a window option at the global level you do `set -wg <option>` but I often see the same option as `set -g <option>` so ... the `-w` is optional?
Feb 20 23:43:46 <thomas_adam>	birkoff: bt
Feb 20 23:43:51 <VSpike>	thomas_adam ahh that explains it! it's very confusing
Feb 20 23:44:31 <VSpike>	thomas_adam does that mean that `set` and `set -g` should be the only forms you need?
Feb 20 23:47:26 <thomas_adam>	VSpike: In most cases, yes.
Feb 20 23:47:42 <VSpike>	thanks!
Feb 21 00:10:41 <slim>	voldial: nesting is considered somewhat of a faux pas, but i find using the client_prefix variable handy to add an indicator to the status bar to show when you're in the prefix key-table... as for 3-deep nests you would need to press prefix 4 times, or look into using prefix2 perhaps?
Feb 21 00:12:03 <slim>	tmuxception
Feb 21 00:16:19 <voldial>	slim: ah, thanks, client_prefix should work, I'll readup on prefix2
Feb 21 00:17:12 <slim>	voldial: #{?client_prefix,#[reverse]:#[noreverse] ,} <- i use that in my status as an example
Feb 21 00:28:22 <slim>	the noreverse would probably conform better as default, now that i'm looking at it but you get the idea

Feb 21 13:24:18 <slim>	birkoff: :set -w automatic-rename on (from affected window, add -t flag and target window if its not from active window/from the shell)
Feb 21 13:24:31 <slim>	tmux is great at inferring option types, so the -w is probably unnecessary as well fwiw
Feb 21 13:34:11 <wyclif>	n00b question: let's say I'm running something that can get disconnected and reconnect inside tmux. For instance, an IRC client, say irssi. If I detach my tmux session, will the IRC client go to sleep and keep timing out and reconnecting, or will it simply keep running?
Feb 21 13:39:08 <ikke>	wyclif: it will just continue to run
Feb 21 13:56:58 <wyclif>	ikke: reason I ask is because I got some complaints the other day when I left irssi running by accident cos I fell asleep. I got kicked from a couple of channels because I kept reconnecting after my laptop fell asleep and woke up
Feb 21 13:57:21 <wyclif>	Maybe running it inside a tmux session is the solution to the problem
Feb 21 13:57:37 <ikke>	Not if tmux runs on you laptop 
Feb 21 13:57:41 <ikke>	your*
Feb 21 13:58:07 <ikke>	If your laptop goes to sleep, so does every application 
Feb 21 13:58:56 <wyclif>	yes
Feb 21 13:59:17 <wyclif>	no way to prevent that other than turning off sleep mode, which seems like a bad idea 
Feb 21 14:00:24 <wyclif>	Of course, I could run ZNC or some other kind of IRC network bouncer as a workaround

Feb 21 19:13:30 <wwalker>	I've tried quite a few things, but I'm not getting the magic together.  When I'm in scrollback, in vi or emacs mode, I want Escape to quit just like `q` does.  Anyone have that mapping working?
Feb 21 19:22:01 <demure>	wwalker: are you using a bind option on the copy-mode in your config?
Feb 21 19:28:48 <wwalker>	demure: yes, and I tried addding it to vi mode, etc.  This is what seems like it should work:  tmux bind-key -T copy-mode escape                 send-keys -X cancel
Feb 21 19:32:00 <demure>	I maybe wrong, but I think bind-key has been depreciated for just `bind`
Feb 21 19:32:00 <wwalker>	that succeeds (it shows up in the output of `tmux list-keys -T copy-mode` but it doesn't work
Feb 21 19:32:10 <slim>	-T copy-mode-vi  <- need the vi to add it to the vi mode-keys
Feb 21 19:35:35 <wwalker>	slim: Thanks!  I just figured that out and was going to post the fix.  (I swear I tried that earlier, but apparently I typoed something when I tried.
Feb 21 19:35:58 <slim>	np, and bind is just an alias for bind-key demure
Feb 21 19:36:19 <demure>	*nod*

Feb 24 12:40:28 <henk>	stsp: thanks for testing! I guess that means it might have to do with my config or plugins … I’ll try to isolate it.
Feb 24 12:55:57 <thomas_adam>	henk: Is there a core file? Check ulimit. You could try tmux with -v in case we’re calling fatal() somewhere instead.

Feb 24 14:00:54 <Nei>	you can try "gdb /path/to/tmux /path/to/corefile" then "bt full"
Feb 24 14:32:17 <henk>	http://pastie.org/p/7dXs68ZbbmRor7uTs7ZluF I guess that’s not very useful, just a lot of »No symbol table info available.« I guess that means I’m missing something but I’m not sure yet what.

Feb 24 14:42:33 <henk>	hm, didn’t quickly find a way to do that so now the prompt for paging is in there with it on line 120. hope that’s no problem. output seems awfully short, is that to be expected or did I do anything wrong? http://pastie.org/p/69YB6uStLxMRfg9UxG6QRT
Feb 24 14:43:05 <henk>	thomas_adam: is that usable?
Feb 24 14:51:18 <ore>	seems to point at this fix: https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/c6e7568471f35f7a22e199b444adf17c685e86f3
Feb 24 14:52:17 <ore>	which I can confirm is not in Debian stable's version of tmux (3.3a-3)
Feb 24 14:54:16 <henk>	oh, yeah, that sounds plausible from the title (: thank you very much
Feb 24 14:57:28 <ore>	if you hit this crash regularly you can file a bug in the Debian bug tracker and the tmux maintainer (me) can arrange for a stable update, but be warned that it's a process that can take weeks
Feb 24 15:02:35 <henk>	ore: first time yesterday, I think. I’ll see and probably just try not to produce such a big ass load of debug output :D as long as it’s already fixed upstream and will be fixed in the next stable, it’s good enough for me for now. thank you (:
Feb 24 15:05:25 <henk>	and, while I’m at it, thanks to everyone involved with creating tmux and maintaining its packages! I appreciate it very much and my digital life would be way worse without it.

Feb 25 03:03:44 <birkoff>	does tmux copy mode pattern search supposed to match non visible ASCII control characters  ? 
Feb 25 08:45:24 <topcat001>	I don't think that will work because internally the text is stored along with attributes for each cell. Search only searches the text.

Feb 29 20:22:08 <mahboubine>	hello everyone
Feb 29 20:22:44 <mahboubine>	do you prefer your tmux statusbar on top or bottom?
Feb 29 20:23:17 <mahboubine>	at the moment, I have the vim status bar + my window manager's bar + tmux's
Feb 29 20:23:29 <mahboubine>	that felt a bit much so i moved the tmux one to the top
Feb 29 20:25:58 <demure>	mahboubine: my view is that the OS bar on top makes more sense as I don't need it often, and then, in your scenario, both the terminal bars are near the bottom where my input is likely to be anyway
Feb 29 20:36:49 <mingdao>	I don't like to look ↑ when I'm typing ↓ , so all of mine are on the bottom.
Feb 29 20:37:10 <mingdao>	https://imgur.com/EI2P31H.png
Feb 29 20:38:44 <mingdao>	That didn't show my wm bar, so this is another screenshot https://imgur.com/X17WDco.png
Feb 29 20:44:29 <mahboubine>	mingdao: I am quite new to tmux, are each of "mutt" "cisco" etc.. sessions or windows?
Feb 29 20:45:28 <mingdao>	1:router* 2:mutt- 3:Cisco  4:workstation  5:MacBook  6:server# 7:fileserver# 8:headache  9:main# 10:workstation       are names of sessions.
Feb 29 20:45:42 <ikke>	windows
Feb 29 20:46:22 <mingdao>	When I start this computer, urxvt starts.  Then I run $HOME/bin/starttmux.sh to start those 10 windows.
Feb 29 20:46:40 <mingdao>	Yes, ikke is correct, I used sessions but they are windows.
Feb 29 20:47:40 <mingdao>	On workstation (the bottom tmux status bar) I have 10 windows created in one session:  home: 10 windows (created Wed Feb 28 17:28:18 2024) (attached)
Feb 29 20:50:01 <mahboubine>	interesting
Feb 29 20:50:09 <mahboubine>	I prefer sessions for unrelated tasks
Feb 29 20:50:27 <mahboubine>	so I can switch between them quickly
Feb 29 20:50:57 <mahboubine>	mod+<workspace number> is far quicker than <tmux prefix> C-n
Feb 29 20:51:02 <mingdao>	In the top status bar, (1:router*) router is window where I ssh to host router, my Linux based router for this LAN, where irssi runs in tmux, (2:mutt) mutt runs on workstation, (3:Cisco) is a window on workstation where minicom is running to access a console port on a Cisco router; (4:workstation) is a window on workstation; ( 5:MacBook) is a window where I ssh from workstation to my MacBook; (6:server#) is 
Feb 29 20:51:08 <mingdao>	a window on workstation where I ssh to host server, etc.
Feb 29 20:51:42 <mingdao>	mahboubine: I use sessions, also.  I am on host router now, chatting in irssi.
Feb 29 20:52:16 <mahboubine>	cool
Feb 29 20:52:24 <mahboubine>	well I need to go now, nice chatting!
Feb 29 20:53:22 <mingdao>	In that window where I am on router, I issue ctrl+bb then d to detach and then `tmux ls` on router to show it's 4 sessions https://imgur.com/OiXAztr.png
Feb 29 20:53:37 <mingdao>	mahboubine: bye

Mar 02 07:20:33 <birkoff>	In command 'command-prompt' a template which one command is "save-buffer '%1'" does not show a visible error when path is invalid run from a terminal in which case it goes to stdout 
Mar 02 07:20:55 <birkoff>	is there a reason why not getting normal display-message like messages when path is invalid ?
Mar 02 09:20:41 <guardian>	hello, shoud the following print to stdout? tmux display -p '#(echo foo)'
Mar 02 10:55:59 <birkoff>	guardian: yes but #() only displays one line and usually it is "loaded" on the second inovcation 
Mar 02 16:41:01 <birkoff>	why is it not possible to use copy-mode to scroll beyond view 'watch' output of more than a screenful ? 
Mar 02 16:41:19 <birkoff>	when watch is running in its own pane 
Mar 02 16:56:48 <mingdao>	birkoff: I don't understand "copy-mode to scroll beyond view 'watch'", but to scroll up a screen in tmux I use prefix+[, and tmux inside tmux, prefix+prefix+[, then PgUp and PgDn, or ↑ or ↓
Mar 02 16:57:25 <birkoff>	I mean for the command 'watch'
Mar 02 16:57:28 <birkoff>	aka 'watch find /'
Mar 02 16:57:44 <birkoff>	it is not possible to scroll beyond it even in copy-mode
Mar 02 17:09:32 <henk>	it 'clear's the screen, I guess
Mar 02 17:18:30 <slim>	birkoff: watch doesn't having paging capabilites, afaik
Mar 02 17:25:44 <birkoff>	slim: but tmux do
Mar 02 17:26:20 <ikke>	Not if watch limits the amount of output to prevent it from scrolling
Mar 02 17:31:46 <slim>	as ikke said, and your output wouldn't update in copy-mode anyhow negating the point of watch'ing it, kinda sorta maybe?  i'm sure there are other tools around that do what watch does with paging
Mar 02 17:32:02 <slim>	man watch specifically says it only outputs a screenful
Mar 02 17:32:15 <henk>	XYProblem? what’s the actual goal here?
Mar 02 18:43:00 <monty_hall>	just upgraded from 3.0 to  3.4, I get this message"size missing" when I issue "tmux split-window -t "$BLAH" -v -p 10 -d 'some_command.bash'"   most likely to do w/ the -p, but the $COLUMNS and $LINES exist in my enivoronment.  Anybody know how to resolve?
Mar 02 18:46:24 <monty_hall>	hold on.  maybe it's not tmux.  it's possible what I'm launching "some_command.bash" that's complaining (odd because I didn't see this in the past w/ 3.0)
Mar 02 18:46:36 <monty_hall>	cd
Mar 02 18:57:19 <monty_hall>	does seem so.  I tried others by hand like /usr/bash or /usr/zsh still get a size error.
Mar 02 18:57:25 <monty_hall>	does->doesn't
Mar 02 18:58:01 <slim>	monty_hall: it's the -p flag, its deprecated, use -l
Mar 02 18:58:27 <monty_hall>	thanks
Mar 02 18:58:38 <slim>	may need to add a % if you were using it as a percentage of the screen
Mar 02 18:59:11 <slim>	-l assumes lines/columns unless you add the % nowadays, i believe

Mar 04 10:15:33 <birkoff>	is it possible to run choose-tree/client when detached from any session ? 
Mar 04 10:34:25 <slim>	birkoff: yes, though unless you have another client attached, i assume choose-client would be empty if it ran at all
Mar 04 11:22:08 <birkoff>	slim: couldn't get it to show up without attaching first
Mar 04 11:22:27 <birkoff>	is client-session-changed the proper hook to use for hooking session in/out ?
Mar 04 11:56:06 <thomas_adam>	birkoff: What is it you're trying to do?  Calling choose-{tree,client} outside of tmux will use the best session which is attached.  With no sessions attached, it won't do anything.
Mar 04 20:16:45 <skered>	has tmux ever had any form on online help?  `tmux command --help, -h, or help` ?
Mar 04 20:17:23 <skered>	Or is just some select commands that have help?
Mar 04 20:21:19 <thomas_adam>	skered: Hmm?
