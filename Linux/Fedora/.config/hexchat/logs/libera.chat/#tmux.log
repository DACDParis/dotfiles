Dec 11 20:52:07 <mingdao>	What are the two pipes then tmux again for?
Dec 11 20:52:35 <mingdao>	tmux a = tmux attach, but does not specify a session if multiples are running.

Feb 20 18:49:45 <birkoff>	is there a simple way to get a list of all available key-tables ? 
Feb 20 18:56:06 <slim>	birkoff: list-keys or customize-mode
Feb 20 19:41:33 <voldial>	How do I `list-sessions -f` for only attached sessions? I have https://bpa.st/EG3A but it's listing them all. So... -f "#{m:session_attached,#{attached}}" must be incorrect...?
Feb 20 19:50:35 <voldial>	hm. I think I had that backwards... but it's still not matching with -f "#{m:attached,#{session_attached}}"
Feb 20 19:51:57 <depesz>	voldial: tbh, i'
Feb 20 19:52:03 <depesz>	i'd probably just grep :)
Feb 20 19:53:02 <slim>	just use #{session_attached}
Feb 20 19:53:19 <slim>	voldial: :ls -f '#{session_attached}'
Feb 20 19:55:36 <voldial>	slim: thx, maybe I'm still doing something wrong... it still lists both the attached and not attached sessions: https://bpa.st/BRMQ
Feb 20 19:58:03 <slim>	something in the -F format i assume, does ls -f '#{session_attached}' show only the attached sessions?
Feb 20 20:00:33 <voldial>	slim: aaah. yes. and now it works, I got rid of the single quote escaping
Feb 20 20:00:41 <voldial>	TY
Feb 20 20:01:17 <slim>	cheers
Feb 20 20:23:59 <ikke>	I'm using alacritty as terminal, and I'm trying to get hyperlinks to work. They are already working outside of tmux. set -g terminal-overrides ",alacritty:RGB"
Feb 20 20:24:04 <ikke>	Oops
Feb 20 20:24:16 <ikke>	From an issue I found the previous configuration option, but that does not help
Feb 20 20:24:51 <ikke>	I have set -g default-terminal tmux-256color (previously screen-256color)
Feb 20 20:25:01 <ikke>	Any idea what I might be missing to get it to work?
Feb 20 20:37:14 <slim>	ikke: do you have mouse enabled in tmux?
Feb 20 20:37:41 <voldial>	How do I do the opposite of `ls: -f '#{session_attached}'`? I tried inserting !, and read the FORMATS secion in the manpage... negation isnt mentioned afict
Feb 20 20:38:20 <ikke>	slim: hmm, apparently not

Feb 20 20:55:51 <slim>	ikke: did you restart the tmux server after adding that terminal-overrides to your tmux conf?
Feb 20 20:57:47 <slim>	may need to be killed and started again at the server level
Feb 20 20:59:33 <voldial>	ah. got it -f "#{==:#{session_attached},0}" (from https://stackoverflow.com/a/75040601)
Feb 20 21:05:38 <ikke>	slim: yes
Feb 20 21:12:01 <slim>	ikke: hrmm, not sure... hints seem to work out of the box with default configs for both tmux/alacritty on my side
Feb 20 21:12:07 <slim>	not sure what to suggest, sorry
Feb 20 21:24:49 <ikke>	Maybe I should look at what tcell (the terminal library) does
Feb 20 21:28:39 <slim>	maybe the #alacritty folks can help, or stick around and someone else may chime in eventually... i can't even break hints functionality
Feb 20 21:29:05 <slim>	ikke: just out of curiosity, what versions of tmux/alacritty ?
Feb 20 21:29:26 <ikke>	tmux 3.3a
Feb 20 21:29:34 <ikke>	alacritty 0.13.1 (fe2a3c56)
Feb 20 21:29:56 <ikke>	using `echo -e '\e]8;;http://example.com\aThis is a link\e]8;;\a'` confirms it's not just the library
Feb 20 21:31:00 <UndeadLeech>	If tmux emits the escapes, Alacritty will work. If Alacritty doesn't work, tmux probably isn't emitting the escapes.
Feb 20 21:32:19 <slim>	ooh THE alacritty folk ;)
Feb 20 21:32:21 <UndeadLeech>	Might need to manually enable it, maybe https://github.com/tmux/tmux/pull/3240 can help with that.
Feb 20 21:32:44 <UndeadLeech>	I don't use tmux so I'm not sure if it's enabled by default.
Feb 20 21:34:05 <ikke>	Someone  suggested 'set-option -ga terminal-features ",alacritty:hyperlinks"' in both the alacritty project as in the tmux project, but no dice
Feb 20 21:34:34 <UndeadLeech>	Is your TERM `alacritty`?
Feb 20 21:34:45 <UndeadLeech>	That does match https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda?permalink_comment_id=4412251#gistcomment-4412251 though.
Feb 20 21:35:26 <ikke>	UndeadLeech: Yes, outside of tmux
Feb 20 21:35:34 <ikke>	inside of tmux it's tmux-256color
Feb 20 21:35:43 <ikke>	(I did try it inside tmux as well, without result)
Feb 20 21:36:33 <ikke>	Let me use that one with a wildcard
Feb 20 21:37:55 <ikke>	no difference
Feb 20 21:39:27 <ikke>	I reduced my tmux config to a minimum to check if that fixed it, but no
Feb 20 21:45:11 <ikke>	https://tpaste.us/xyqv

Feb 20 21:58:04 <ikke>	In the tmux-server log, I see: removing term alacritty
Feb 20 21:58:36 <ikke>	That seems to indicate some error happened
Feb 20 21:59:04 <ikke>	"unknown terminal feature: hyperlinks"
Feb 20 22:10:00 <ikke>	Oh, apparently 3.3a does not have it yet :/

Feb 20 22:19:47 <birkoff>	running 'tmux -C' and typing inside 'refresh-client -C' causes tmux to crash down
Feb 20 22:21:28 <ikke>	slim: UndeadLeech upgrading tmux fixed it, thanks for the help!
Feb 20 23:06:54 <thomas_adam>	birkoff: Does it?  Is there a corefile?
Feb 20 23:08:13 <birkoff>	yes but it probably contains private stuff
Feb 20 23:14:36 <slim>	ikke: good stuff!
Feb 20 23:23:50 <birkoff>	here's the repeatable stack trace: https://dpaste.com/DH9VRYJRU 
Feb 20 23:26:09 <thomas_adam>	birkoff: Without debug symbols, that's useless.
Feb 20 23:27:03 <birkoff>	maybe you can instruct me how to debug it ?
Feb 20 23:27:28 <thomas_adam>	I can't reproduce the problem you're having though.
Feb 20 23:38:34 <voldial>	is there a way to have a indicator of what tmux process you are "on" when hitting ctrl-b? I ask because sometimes I'm nested 2 or 3 deep, and I can always hit "ctrl-b" 2x to command the 2nd nested tmux, but I cant seem to get that to work the 3rd time in the odd case that i'm nested 3 deep.
Feb 20 23:40:31 <VSpike>	I had a nice setup where the names of my panes in the status bar updated with current directory. This was using  a PROMPT_COMMAND in bash. It has stopped working and I can't figure out why. It works outside tmux still. Inside tmux, even just using printf directly to send the escape chars doesn't work .. I have `allow-rename on` and
Feb 20 23:40:32 <VSpike>	`automatic-rename off`. What could I be missing?
Feb 20 23:41:57 <VSpike>	Also, tmux config has always confused me. Are `setw`, `set-window-option` and `set -w` all equivalent?
Feb 20 23:43:06 <thomas_adam>	VSpike: Yeah -- the options table knows the context, so "set" is fine to use for all of them.
Feb 20 23:43:28 <birkoff>	thomas_adam: can I do anything with the coredump file myself ? 
Feb 20 23:43:29 <VSpike>	The docs seem to say to set a window option at the global level you do `set -wg <option>` but I often see the same option as `set -g <option>` so ... the `-w` is optional?
Feb 20 23:43:46 <thomas_adam>	birkoff: bt
Feb 20 23:43:51 <VSpike>	thomas_adam ahh that explains it! it's very confusing
Feb 20 23:44:31 <VSpike>	thomas_adam does that mean that `set` and `set -g` should be the only forms you need?
Feb 20 23:47:26 <thomas_adam>	VSpike: In most cases, yes.
Feb 20 23:47:42 <VSpike>	thanks!
Feb 21 00:10:41 <slim>	voldial: nesting is considered somewhat of a faux pas, but i find using the client_prefix variable handy to add an indicator to the status bar to show when you're in the prefix key-table... as for 3-deep nests you would need to press prefix 4 times, or look into using prefix2 perhaps?
Feb 21 00:12:03 <slim>	tmuxception
Feb 21 00:16:19 <voldial>	slim: ah, thanks, client_prefix should work, I'll readup on prefix2
Feb 21 00:17:12 <slim>	voldial: #{?client_prefix,#[reverse]:#[noreverse] ,} <- i use that in my status as an example
Feb 21 00:28:22 <slim>	the noreverse would probably conform better as default, now that i'm looking at it but you get the idea

Feb 21 13:24:18 <slim>	birkoff: :set -w automatic-rename on (from affected window, add -t flag and target window if its not from active window/from the shell)
Feb 21 13:24:31 <slim>	tmux is great at inferring option types, so the -w is probably unnecessary as well fwiw
Feb 21 13:34:11 <wyclif>	n00b question: let's say I'm running something that can get disconnected and reconnect inside tmux. For instance, an IRC client, say irssi. If I detach my tmux session, will the IRC client go to sleep and keep timing out and reconnecting, or will it simply keep running?
Feb 21 13:39:08 <ikke>	wyclif: it will just continue to run
Feb 21 13:56:58 <wyclif>	ikke: reason I ask is because I got some complaints the other day when I left irssi running by accident cos I fell asleep. I got kicked from a couple of channels because I kept reconnecting after my laptop fell asleep and woke up
Feb 21 13:57:21 <wyclif>	Maybe running it inside a tmux session is the solution to the problem
Feb 21 13:57:37 <ikke>	Not if tmux runs on you laptop 
Feb 21 13:57:41 <ikke>	your*
Feb 21 13:58:07 <ikke>	If your laptop goes to sleep, so does every application 
Feb 21 13:58:56 <wyclif>	yes
Feb 21 13:59:17 <wyclif>	no way to prevent that other than turning off sleep mode, which seems like a bad idea 
Feb 21 14:00:24 <wyclif>	Of course, I could run ZNC or some other kind of IRC network bouncer as a workaround

Feb 21 19:13:30 <wwalker>	I've tried quite a few things, but I'm not getting the magic together.  When I'm in scrollback, in vi or emacs mode, I want Escape to quit just like `q` does.  Anyone have that mapping working?
Feb 21 19:22:01 <demure>	wwalker: are you using a bind option on the copy-mode in your config?
Feb 21 19:28:48 <wwalker>	demure: yes, and I tried addding it to vi mode, etc.  This is what seems like it should work:  tmux bind-key -T copy-mode escape                 send-keys -X cancel
Feb 21 19:32:00 <demure>	I maybe wrong, but I think bind-key has been depreciated for just `bind`
Feb 21 19:32:00 <wwalker>	that succeeds (it shows up in the output of `tmux list-keys -T copy-mode` but it doesn't work
Feb 21 19:32:10 <slim>	-T copy-mode-vi  <- need the vi to add it to the vi mode-keys
Feb 21 19:35:35 <wwalker>	slim: Thanks!  I just figured that out and was going to post the fix.  (I swear I tried that earlier, but apparently I typoed something when I tried.
Feb 21 19:35:58 <slim>	np, and bind is just an alias for bind-key demure
Feb 21 19:36:19 <demure>	*nod*

Feb 24 12:40:28 <henk>	stsp: thanks for testing! I guess that means it might have to do with my config or plugins … I’ll try to isolate it.
Feb 24 12:55:57 <thomas_adam>	henk: Is there a core file? Check ulimit. You could try tmux with -v in case we’re calling fatal() somewhere instead.

Feb 24 14:00:54 <Nei>	you can try "gdb /path/to/tmux /path/to/corefile" then "bt full"
Feb 24 14:32:17 <henk>	http://pastie.org/p/7dXs68ZbbmRor7uTs7ZluF I guess that’s not very useful, just a lot of »No symbol table info available.« I guess that means I’m missing something but I’m not sure yet what.

Feb 24 14:42:33 <henk>	hm, didn’t quickly find a way to do that so now the prompt for paging is in there with it on line 120. hope that’s no problem. output seems awfully short, is that to be expected or did I do anything wrong? http://pastie.org/p/69YB6uStLxMRfg9UxG6QRT
Feb 24 14:43:05 <henk>	thomas_adam: is that usable?
Feb 24 14:51:18 <ore>	seems to point at this fix: https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/c6e7568471f35f7a22e199b444adf17c685e86f3
Feb 24 14:52:17 <ore>	which I can confirm is not in Debian stable's version of tmux (3.3a-3)
Feb 24 14:54:16 <henk>	oh, yeah, that sounds plausible from the title (: thank you very much
Feb 24 14:57:28 <ore>	if you hit this crash regularly you can file a bug in the Debian bug tracker and the tmux maintainer (me) can arrange for a stable update, but be warned that it's a process that can take weeks
Feb 24 15:02:35 <henk>	ore: first time yesterday, I think. I’ll see and probably just try not to produce such a big ass load of debug output :D as long as it’s already fixed upstream and will be fixed in the next stable, it’s good enough for me for now. thank you (:
Feb 24 15:05:25 <henk>	and, while I’m at it, thanks to everyone involved with creating tmux and maintaining its packages! I appreciate it very much and my digital life would be way worse without it.

Feb 25 03:03:44 <birkoff>	does tmux copy mode pattern search supposed to match non visible ASCII control characters  ? 
Feb 25 08:45:24 <topcat001>	I don't think that will work because internally the text is stored along with attributes for each cell. Search only searches the text.

Feb 29 20:22:08 <mahboubine>	hello everyone
Feb 29 20:22:44 <mahboubine>	do you prefer your tmux statusbar on top or bottom?
Feb 29 20:23:17 <mahboubine>	at the moment, I have the vim status bar + my window manager's bar + tmux's
Feb 29 20:23:29 <mahboubine>	that felt a bit much so i moved the tmux one to the top
Feb 29 20:25:58 <demure>	mahboubine: my view is that the OS bar on top makes more sense as I don't need it often, and then, in your scenario, both the terminal bars are near the bottom where my input is likely to be anyway
Feb 29 20:36:49 <mingdao>	I don't like to look ↑ when I'm typing ↓ , so all of mine are on the bottom.
Feb 29 20:37:10 <mingdao>	https://imgur.com/EI2P31H.png
Feb 29 20:38:44 <mingdao>	That didn't show my wm bar, so this is another screenshot https://imgur.com/X17WDco.png
Feb 29 20:44:29 <mahboubine>	mingdao: I am quite new to tmux, are each of "mutt" "cisco" etc.. sessions or windows?
Feb 29 20:45:28 <mingdao>	1:router* 2:mutt- 3:Cisco  4:workstation  5:MacBook  6:server# 7:fileserver# 8:headache  9:main# 10:workstation       are names of sessions.
Feb 29 20:45:42 <ikke>	windows
Feb 29 20:46:22 <mingdao>	When I start this computer, urxvt starts.  Then I run $HOME/bin/starttmux.sh to start those 10 windows.
Feb 29 20:46:40 <mingdao>	Yes, ikke is correct, I used sessions but they are windows.
Feb 29 20:47:40 <mingdao>	On workstation (the bottom tmux status bar) I have 10 windows created in one session:  home: 10 windows (created Wed Feb 28 17:28:18 2024) (attached)
Feb 29 20:50:01 <mahboubine>	interesting
Feb 29 20:50:09 <mahboubine>	I prefer sessions for unrelated tasks
Feb 29 20:50:27 <mahboubine>	so I can switch between them quickly
Feb 29 20:50:57 <mahboubine>	mod+<workspace number> is far quicker than <tmux prefix> C-n
Feb 29 20:51:02 <mingdao>	In the top status bar, (1:router*) router is window where I ssh to host router, my Linux based router for this LAN, where irssi runs in tmux, (2:mutt) mutt runs on workstation, (3:Cisco) is a window on workstation where minicom is running to access a console port on a Cisco router; (4:workstation) is a window on workstation; ( 5:MacBook) is a window where I ssh from workstation to my MacBook; (6:server#) is 
Feb 29 20:51:08 <mingdao>	a window on workstation where I ssh to host server, etc.
Feb 29 20:51:42 <mingdao>	mahboubine: I use sessions, also.  I am on host router now, chatting in irssi.
Feb 29 20:52:16 <mahboubine>	cool
Feb 29 20:52:24 <mahboubine>	well I need to go now, nice chatting!
Feb 29 20:53:22 <mingdao>	In that window where I am on router, I issue ctrl+bb then d to detach and then `tmux ls` on router to show it's 4 sessions https://imgur.com/OiXAztr.png
Feb 29 20:53:37 <mingdao>	mahboubine: bye

Mar 02 07:20:33 <birkoff>	In command 'command-prompt' a template which one command is "save-buffer '%1'" does not show a visible error when path is invalid run from a terminal in which case it goes to stdout 
Mar 02 07:20:55 <birkoff>	is there a reason why not getting normal display-message like messages when path is invalid ?
Mar 02 09:20:41 <guardian>	hello, shoud the following print to stdout? tmux display -p '#(echo foo)'
Mar 02 10:55:59 <birkoff>	guardian: yes but #() only displays one line and usually it is "loaded" on the second inovcation 
Mar 02 16:41:01 <birkoff>	why is it not possible to use copy-mode to scroll beyond view 'watch' output of more than a screenful ? 
Mar 02 16:41:19 <birkoff>	when watch is running in its own pane 
Mar 02 16:56:48 <mingdao>	birkoff: I don't understand "copy-mode to scroll beyond view 'watch'", but to scroll up a screen in tmux I use prefix+[, and tmux inside tmux, prefix+prefix+[, then PgUp and PgDn, or ↑ or ↓
Mar 02 16:57:25 <birkoff>	I mean for the command 'watch'
Mar 02 16:57:28 <birkoff>	aka 'watch find /'
Mar 02 16:57:44 <birkoff>	it is not possible to scroll beyond it even in copy-mode
Mar 02 17:09:32 <henk>	it 'clear's the screen, I guess
Mar 02 17:18:30 <slim>	birkoff: watch doesn't having paging capabilites, afaik
Mar 02 17:25:44 <birkoff>	slim: but tmux do
Mar 02 17:26:20 <ikke>	Not if watch limits the amount of output to prevent it from scrolling
Mar 02 17:31:46 <slim>	as ikke said, and your output wouldn't update in copy-mode anyhow negating the point of watch'ing it, kinda sorta maybe?  i'm sure there are other tools around that do what watch does with paging
Mar 02 17:32:02 <slim>	man watch specifically says it only outputs a screenful
Mar 02 17:32:15 <henk>	XYProblem? what’s the actual goal here?
Mar 02 18:43:00 <monty_hall>	just upgraded from 3.0 to  3.4, I get this message"size missing" when I issue "tmux split-window -t "$BLAH" -v -p 10 -d 'some_command.bash'"   most likely to do w/ the -p, but the $COLUMNS and $LINES exist in my enivoronment.  Anybody know how to resolve?
Mar 02 18:46:24 <monty_hall>	hold on.  maybe it's not tmux.  it's possible what I'm launching "some_command.bash" that's complaining (odd because I didn't see this in the past w/ 3.0)
Mar 02 18:46:36 <monty_hall>	cd
Mar 02 18:57:19 <monty_hall>	does seem so.  I tried others by hand like /usr/bash or /usr/zsh still get a size error.
Mar 02 18:57:25 <monty_hall>	does->doesn't
Mar 02 18:58:01 <slim>	monty_hall: it's the -p flag, its deprecated, use -l
Mar 02 18:58:27 <monty_hall>	thanks
Mar 02 18:58:38 <slim>	may need to add a % if you were using it as a percentage of the screen
Mar 02 18:59:11 <slim>	-l assumes lines/columns unless you add the % nowadays, i believe

Mar 04 10:15:33 <birkoff>	is it possible to run choose-tree/client when detached from any session ? 
Mar 04 10:34:25 <slim>	birkoff: yes, though unless you have another client attached, i assume choose-client would be empty if it ran at all
Mar 04 11:22:08 <birkoff>	slim: couldn't get it to show up without attaching first
Mar 04 11:22:27 <birkoff>	is client-session-changed the proper hook to use for hooking session in/out ?
Mar 04 11:56:06 <thomas_adam>	birkoff: What is it you're trying to do?  Calling choose-{tree,client} outside of tmux will use the best session which is attached.  With no sessions attached, it won't do anything.
Mar 04 20:16:45 <skered>	has tmux ever had any form on online help?  `tmux command --help, -h, or help` ?
Mar 04 20:17:23 <skered>	Or is just some select commands that have help?
Mar 04 20:21:19 <thomas_adam>	skered: Hmm?

Mar 07 03:06:14 <slim>	foul_owl: -S designates the start line of the capture, -10 is starting from 10 lines in the history to the end of your visible pane
Mar 07 03:10:58 <slim>	i would pipe it through tail, probably
Mar 07 03:12:02 <slim>	now that you mention it, not sure theres an easy/graceful way to do that
Mar 07 03:12:10 <slim>	can think of a few hacky ways, maybe
Mar 07 03:22:01 <slim>	tmux capture-pane -p| tail -n 10
Mar 07 03:22:14 <slim>	tmux capture-pane -p -S $(($LINES-10))
Mar 07 03:22:27 <slim>	:capture-pane -S '#{e|-|:#{pane_height},10}'
Mar 07 03:22:45 <slim>	caveat being that output needs to be at the bottom of the visible pane
Mar 07 03:23:03 <slim>	hacky at best, feel like i'm overlooking something dreadfully obvious

Mar 07 17:11:45 <birkoff>	depesz: i dont have a methodical case, but it happened to me more than several times already
Mar 07 17:12:40 <birkoff>	mostly SEGV dumps
Mar 07 17:13:21 <depesz>	no idea, sorry.
Mar 07 17:14:52 <mingdao>	birkoff: Do they show up in `coredumpctl list` ?
Mar 07 17:15:03 <birkoff>	mingdao: yes obviously I run systemd
Mar 07 18:00:54 <Demosthenex>	sorry to hear that.
Mar 07 19:32:26 <Elodin>	Hi, when opening tmux i get a https://termbin.com/o0g46
Mar 07 19:32:40 <Elodin>	this execute line
Mar 07 19:43:47 <Elodin>	same happens without any configuration
Mar 07 19:52:59 <mingdao>	Elodin: What VT are you using?
Mar 07 19:53:21 <Elodin>	urxvt
Mar 07 19:53:27 <mingdao>	Elodin: That sounds like a rxvt-unicode bug, although you've got some other special stuff there.
Mar 07 19:53:51 <Elodin>	truly since then i installed kitty and it worked fine
Mar 07 19:54:12 <Elodin>	i might downgrade urxvt and see if it goes back to the way it was
Mar 07 19:56:16 <mingdao>	Elodin: It is a bug in the command.C file.  This is a patch that I used on one build I have locally:  https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/ports/x11/rxvt-unicode/patches/patch-src_command_C?rev=1.6&content-type=text/t-type=text/plain
Mar 07 19:56:32 <mingdao>	Elodin: What Linux distro are you using?
Mar 07 19:56:41 <Elodin>	mingdao: archlinux
Mar 07 19:58:03 <mingdao>	Same here.
Mar 07 19:58:20 <mingdao>	Let me see which I am running on this Arch workstation.
Mar 07 20:00:46 <mingdao>	I'm running rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs (9.31-5) with a PKGBUILD that I build locally.
Mar 07 20:00:59 <mingdao>	I have IgnorePkg   =  rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs-debug rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs
Mar 07 20:01:07 <mingdao>	So it doesn't automatically get updated.
Mar 07 20:01:30 <mingdao>	I spoke to susi recently about it.  Let me go back and read which pkg they use on Arch.
Mar 07 20:01:47 <mingdao>	<susi> I'm using https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs
Mar 07 20:02:22 <mingdao>	That is what my rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs-9.31-5 started from, but I added a couple of patches, so I am not letting it automatically update atm.
Mar 07 20:02:46 <Elodin>	damn
Mar 07 20:05:50 <Elodin>	this might be too much for me
Mar 07 20:06:35 <mingdao>	Which version of rxvt-unicode do you have where it outputs https://termbin.com/o0g46 ?
Mar 07 20:06:59 <mingdao>	I have reported it to the Arch maintainer, but not response.
Mar 07 20:07:08 <mingdao>	The Arch PKGBUILD is a few months old.
Mar 07 20:07:26 <Elodin>	interesting by installing the latest rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs
Mar 07 20:07:29 <mingdao>	This has been fixed by rxvt-unicode upstream, but Arch is behind.
Mar 07 20:07:31 <Elodin>	it fixed
Mar 07 20:07:46 <mingdao>	The rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs package from AUR?
Mar 07 20:07:50 <Elodin>	yes
Mar 07 20:08:09 <mingdao>	I forget why I have held back from that one.
Mar 07 20:08:25 <mingdao>	Elodin: Glad you got rid of that color sequence line.
Mar 07 20:08:48 <Elodin>	yeah, but like you said it yourself... something held you back from this
Mar 07 20:08:50 <Elodin>	haha
Mar 07 20:08:58 <mingdao>	It wasn't a huge bother to me, because I could issue ctrl+u twice on the end of the line, and it cleared the screen.
Mar 07 20:10:14 <Elodin>	i guess i should build it from the head then cuz all my other goodies stopped working
Mar 07 20:11:32 <mingdao>	Elodin: This https://0x0.st/H7FH.txt is mingdao@workstation ~/software/rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs $ ls -1
Mar 07 20:11:49 <mingdao>	patch-src_command.patch is my patch from https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/ports/x11/rxvt-unicode/patches/patch-src_command_C?rev=1.6
Mar 07 20:12:48 <mingdao>	I have mingdao@workstation ~/Arch/rxvt-unicode   from mingdao@workstation ~/Arch/ git clone https://github.com/exg/rxvt-unicode.git
Mar 07 20:14:32 <mingdao>	This is the repo of exg, who is the one really maintaining rxvt-unicode now, rather than schmorp.
Mar 07 20:15:29 <mingdao>	I'll just quote from what they told me.
Mar 07 20:15:59 <mingdao>	< mingdao> exg: Is there a git mirror of http://cvs.schmorp.de/rxvt-unicode/ ?
Mar 07 20:16:04 <mingdao>	< exg> mingdao: yes I maintain one https://github.com/exg/rxvt-unicode
Mar 07 20:16:37 <mingdao>	When I get the time I'm going to make a PKGBUILD for that, and use it, updating it periodically via `git update`.
Mar 07 20:18:43 <Elodin>	i suppose i would downgrade the packages i'm using? But i get libperl.so errors
Mar 07 20:18:56 <Elodin>	sad cuz i dont know if im capable of following the instructions
Mar 07 20:19:19 <mingdao>	Elodin: Ask about it in #rxvt-unicode
Mar 07 20:19:41 <mingdao>	exg is in that channel
Mar 07 20:19:52 <Elodin>	thanks
Mar 07 20:19:55 <Elodin>	for everything
Mar 07 20:20:00 <mingdao>	Show your link https://termbin.com/o0g46 and ask how to fix it.
Mar 07 20:20:06 <mingdao>	yw
Mar 07 20:21:23 <mingdao>	We shall see what we shall see.
Mar 07 20:23:02 <mingdao>	I would tell them that you changed from the Arch repo package rxvt-unicode-9.31-4 to the AUR package rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs-9.31-7 and it no longer happens.
Mar 07 20:26:01 <mingdao>	Elodin: Notice in #rxvt-unicode the /topic has "please wait up to 24 hours for a response to your question!"  Just stay joined to the channel and see.

Mar 09 12:36:42 <birkoff>	Why does this not work: `choose-tree -f "#{==:#{session_name},#{client_session}}"`  while this does: `choose-tree -f "#{==:#{session_name},some_session_name}"`
Mar 09 12:54:11 <birkoff>	tried also with comparing #{session_name} to itself

Mar 09 15:48:17 <slim>	birkoff: the choose-tree doesn't work as expected due to how variable substitution is handled, use a run-shell with added #'s
Mar 09 15:48:29 <birkoff>	slim: tried that too
Mar 09 15:48:49 <slim>	ie. run -C 'choose-tree -f "##{==:##{session_name},#{client_session}}"'
Mar 09 15:48:51 <slim>	that doesn't work ?
Mar 09 15:54:08 <slim>	birkoff: works as expected with client_session and session_name on my end with that syntax, what unexpected output are you getting?
Mar 09 15:56:10 <birkoff>	didnt double hash #{client_session}
Mar 09 15:56:16 <birkoff>	did*
Mar 09 15:57:28 <slim>	right on, so all good then? what did you mean by keep the colors when pane dies?
Mar 09 15:58:26 <birkoff>	if I have a an application that is showing colors like diff in a dead panel it turns "black&white"
Mar 09 15:58:39 <birkoff>	i.e. when it dies
Mar 09 16:03:18 <slim>	hrmm, not sure what handles dead pane style tbh - do you have a custom window-style setting?
Mar 09 16:04:37 <slim>	do non-active panes have different sytles from your window-active-style ?
Mar 09 17:15:29 <sybariten>	Hmm hmm hmm , is it common for people to remap ctrl-b in tmux to ctrl-a instead? I have ctrl-b in one instance and have changed it to ctrl-a in another, and the latter is sooo much nicer. However, i just realized i am not able to do the bash key shortcut for "beginning of line"...
Mar 09 17:15:52 <jakllsch>	you do know about escaping the prefix right?
Mar 09 21:07:06 <sybariten>	jakllsch: no, not sure about that one
Mar 09 21:23:47 <jakllsch>	^B ^B should get you a ^B into the actual pane

Mar 11 14:56:01 <dorfen>	hi, can anyone help me in getting the statusbar to have a transparent background? set status-bg default just turns the background green
Mar 11 15:00:29 <jakllsch>	define transparent
Mar 11 15:00:36 <demure>	dorfen: https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1#fg=colour
Mar 11 15:03:52 <demure>	so, you might be able to use bg=default
Mar 11 15:05:15 <dorfen>	I was actually just quite stupid and had a theme overwrite the settings after i defined them.. Just a skill issue on my part :)
Mar 11 17:16:06 <hasp>	hi! i want to bind '|' key to split window vertically but ":bind | split-window -v" is splitting window horizontally instead.
Mar 11 17:16:37 <hasp>	am i doing something wrong?

Mar 12 07:38:59 <aog>	when I run tmux and open another tmux within I'm unable to copy by selection w/ mouse
Mar 12 07:40:01 <aog>	e.g. I'm in tmux (local) and ssh to remote which also runs tmux
Mar 12 09:09:09 <slim>	aog: probably conflicting mouse bind-keys, disable mouse on remote session temporarily or unbind the mousedrag binds
Mar 12 09:09:53 <slim>	assuming you want to copy to the local tmux buffers
Mar 12 09:27:28 <aog>	you were right slim: disabling the mouse on the secondary session allows the primary to select and copy correctly
Mar 12 16:14:47 <lavaball>	portage give me nice 5 out of 10 or whatever in tmux in the status bar. i do have a script that also does the 1 out of 3 thing. how can i tell tmux to show it like portage does?

Mar 12 18:08:34 <depesz>	lavaball: it would probably help if you showed what you have in mind. what is portage, what is its output. what you have configured in tmux, and how does it show.
Mar 12 18:09:41 <lavaball>	portage is the packet manager. when it installs stuff, it shows the 2 out 16 ... in the tmux status bar.
Mar 12 18:10:03 <lavaball>	i only changed the colors and set mode-keys to vi.
Mar 12 18:11:00 <depesz>	lavaball: please show: "tmux show-options -g | grep status" - via paste site
Mar 12 18:17:33 <depesz>	lavaball: check if this does what you'd like: for i in {1..10}; do printf '\x1b]0;%d of 10\x07' $i; sleep .5; done
Mar 12 18:17:48 <depesz>	this is command to run in shell (bash for sure, other shells - i'm not certain it will work)
Mar 12 18:18:35 <lavaball>	yes!
Mar 12 18:18:36 <lavaball>	that's it!
Mar 12 18:20:01 <depesz>	looks like you have 'set-titles' set to on
Mar 12 18:20:02 <lavaball>	oh, doesn't work with ksh though. gives me: printf: {1..10}: expected numeric value      i'll figure itoutthough.
Mar 12 18:20:28 <lavaball>	seems to be the default setting, since it works on all my machines.
Mar 12 18:22:06 <depesz>	perl -e '$|++;for (1..10) { printf "\x1b]0;%s of 10\x07", $_; sleep 1}'
Mar 12 18:22:12 <depesz>	without bash :)
Mar 12 18:22:41 <lavaball>	i bet it works in ksh as well, somehow.
Mar 12 18:22:59 <lavaball>	i mean tmux is part of the base system as well, so i think those two are fully compatible.
Mar 12 18:23:05 <lavaball>	anyway, thanks so much!
Mar 12 18:23:20 <lavaball>	though is there a place where i can look up all the hyroglyphys?
Mar 12 18:24:50 <depesz>	"hyroglyphs"?
Mar 12 18:24:53 <lavaball>	ad in the \x1b]0 and \x07
Mar 12 18:24:59 <lavaball>	as in
Mar 12 18:25:06 <ikke>	ansi escape codes
Mar 12 18:25:36 <depesz>	lavaball: you're on linux?
Mar 12 18:25:58 <lavaball>	openbsd here, but i have linux boxes available as well.
Mar 12 18:26:04 <lavaball>	the ssh magic, you understand.
Mar 12 18:26:08 <depesz>	no idea about bsd, on linux: man console_codes
Mar 12 18:27:26 <lavaball>	yeah, doesn't exist on openbsd. got it on linux. 
Mar 12 18:27:35 <lavaball>	probably just a different name though.
Mar 12 18:27:46 <lavaball>	if openbsd has anything then it's man pages.
Mar 12 19:07:16 <depesz>	lavaball: can you show me your status-* settings ?
Mar 12 19:20:32 <lavaball>	why? we solved the whole thing.
Mar 12 19:21:25 <depesz>	curious about a thing
Mar 12 19:21:31 <lavaball>	gay.
Mar 12 19:21:32 <lavaball>	but sure.
Mar 12 19:22:26 <lavaball>	https://bpa.st/R4RA
Mar 12 19:23:40 <depesz>	thx
Mar 12 19:23:45 <lavaball>	so?
Mar 12 19:23:47 <lavaball>	did i win?
Mar 12 19:43:57 <lavaball>	.. guess not.
Mar 12 19:44:01 <lavaball>	either waay, thanks again.
Mar 12 19:58:09 <trev>	does a tmux plugin .tmux script run every time a session starts?
Mar 12 20:00:39 <trev>	wait that's a dumb question nevermind
Mar 12 20:07:16 <mingdao>	trev: What are you trying to figure out?
Mar 12 20:10:10 <trev>	mingdao: trying to get my plugin to set-enviroment every time tmux starts
Mar 12 20:10:33 <trev>	so i can add another script to $PATH and then can use the script in a tmux session on cli

Mar 13 18:57:27 <angle>	or is it safer to source .zprofile for each new server?
Mar 13 18:57:50 <angle>	that feels like the wrong solution though.

Mar 14 14:10:16 <kroovy_>	Hi fellows! Is there a maximum amount of Panes? Via a script call `tmux split-window` nine times. But tmux only opens 7 Panes :(
Mar 14 14:11:15 <kroovy_>	sorry tmux only opens 8 panes
Mar 14 14:12:09 <kroovy_>	hmm, I manually can split the 9th time .
Mar 14 14:12:54 <ikke>	I just created a window with 16 panes
Mar 14 14:14:06 <kroovy_>	i think it has something todo with the virtual terminal columns
Mar 14 14:14:10 <osse>	I created one with 21 !!!1
Mar 14 14:14:18 <kroovy_>	my virtual terminal was to small, i think
Mar 14 14:14:29 <osse>	for i in {1..20}; do tmux split-window -h; tmux select-layout -E; done
Mar 14 14:14:30 <kroovy_>	i switched to a horizontal split for my last call, now it works
Mar 14 14:15:22 <kroovy_>	I'm happy, thanks :)
Mar 14 14:28:50 <mingdao>	Can someone show a screenshot of the usefulness of so many panes?  I can not wrap my head around it.
Mar 14 14:29:19 <osse>	I see none. I usually have 2 or 3
Mar 14 14:29:26 <mingdao>	The most panes I have used is 4 while working on 4 servers at a time.
Mar 14 14:29:29 <osse>	It just sounded strange to have a hard limit
Mar 14 14:29:41 <mingdao>	I understand you were just testing the limits.
Mar 14 14:30:04 <ikke>	I have configured 8 servers at the same time
Mar 14 14:30:09 <ikke>	or ran commands at least
Mar 14 14:30:19 <ikke>	8 or 9
Mar 14 14:30:46 <mingdao>	I mostly use tmux with a script to start 10 windows after I launch my VT.  If I had 10 monitors and could see them all at once, I wouldn't need those 10 windows on one screen.
Mar 14 14:33:22 <mingdao>	kroovy_: Screenshot?
Mar 14 14:43:01 <Zed>	my every day carry has 4 and one is a weather web site :)
Mar 14 14:44:36 <kroovy_>	@mingdao, thanks for your interest. it's usefull to manage loadbalancer setups. in this case: 1 loadbalancer + 1 adminserver + 5 webserver + 2 db server (can't provide a screenshot right now)
Mar 14 14:44:58 <Zed>	I mostly work in one with a binding to bring me directly into a pain with vim and another with bash for quick and dirty stuff and junk
Mar 14 14:45:07 <Zed>	pane*
Mar 14 14:45:36 <ikke>	I have a setup with tmuxinator that creates a default layout with a terminal, git status -sb autorefreshed and tig
Mar 14 14:46:03 <Zed>	function keys binded to switching around 
Mar 14 14:46:17 <ikke>	I have vim keybindings with ctrl
Mar 14 14:46:29 <ikke>	hjkl
Mar 14 14:47:06 <ikke>	ctrl+f opens a pane with fzf to switch between sessions
Mar 14 14:48:39 <Zed>	that's cool
Mar 14 14:49:31 <Zed>	that's prolly more intitive than ctrl-a something something
Mar 14 14:49:48 <Zed>	jeez I can't type today
Mar 14 14:49:55 <Zed>	intuitive*
Mar 14 14:53:08 <ikke>	I'm not the only one who remaps ^B to ^A :(
Mar 14 14:53:10 <ikke>	:)
Mar 14 14:59:28 <mingdao>	Zed: Check out this weather.sh script:  https://techfix.me/files/weather.sh
Mar 14 14:59:50 <ikke>	404
Mar 14 14:59:50 <Zed>	only us old screen users do ctrl-a hahah
Mar 14 15:00:02 <Zed>	yeah 404
Mar 14 15:00:10 <mingdao>	Use view-source:https://techfix.me/files/weather.sh to see the bash script without downloading it.
Mar 14 15:00:19 <mingdao>	Oh, let me go check that out.
Mar 14 15:02:54 <mingdao>	Fixed.  I was on the wrong server  mingdao@backupserver /var/www/localhost/htdocs/files $
Mar 14 15:02:58 <mingdao>	The backupserver
Mar 14 15:03:21 <mingdao>	Change the location to yours.
Mar 14 15:04:12 <Zed>	I use https://wttr.in/nyc
Mar 14 15:05:03 <mingdao>	SCreenshot of it https://0x0.st/HFTA.png
Mar 14 15:05:34 <mingdao>	Zed: I have a good friend who lives in Manhattan.
Mar 14 15:05:57 <Zed>	oh hahhah it is the same thing - I just read the scipt
Mar 14 15:06:18 <ikke>	lol: We were unable to find your location
Mar 14 15:06:20 <ikke>	so we have brought you to Oymyakon,
Mar 14 15:06:22 <ikke>	one of the coldest permanently inhabited locales on the planet.
Mar 14 15:09:16 <Zed>	it's odd when I open the site with lynx I don't see the color
Mar 14 15:09:24 <mingdao>	Eewwww...
Mar 14 15:10:41 <mingdao>	Zed: IMNSHO this is appropriate for a VT, so use      curl wttr.in/nyc
Mar 14 15:15:06 <Zed>	mingdao: I have a pane always open with it 
Mar 14 15:15:35 <Zed>	so I just refresh
Mar 14 15:18:25 <ikke>	You could problably use watch -n 900 ..
Mar 14 15:18:29 <ikke>	then it would auto refresh every 15m
Mar 14 15:19:34 <ikke>	hmm, you get a reduced color output (if you use watch -c)
Mar 14 15:19:42 <mingdao>	I don't think that's going to work with  watch
Mar 14 15:22:24 <ikke>	There is no reason it couldn't
Mar 14 15:22:29 <Zed>	yeah all good... I am going to take your scritp though and make it take arguments so I can just be like w <location>  in bash
Mar 14 15:24:20 <mingdao>	ikke: IDK where you're located, so you might need to find this for your country:  https://www.weather.gov/media/wrh/mesowest/metar_decode_key.pdf
Mar 14 15:24:53 <ikke>	mingdao: I managed to get the correct location already, just found it funny
Mar 14 15:24:55 <mingdao>	Zed: vim weather.sh     FTW!
Mar 14 15:25:30 <mingdao>	ikke: Yeah, I would not like being in "one of the coldest permanently inhabited locales on the planet"!
Mar 14 15:26:08 <ikke>	'may you inhabited the coldest permantly locale on the planet'
Mar 14 15:26:15 <ikke>	s/inhabited/inhabit/
Mar 14 15:27:11 <mingdao>	And that link wasn't what you need, per se, but this is moar betterer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_airports_by_IATA_and_ICAO_code
Mar 14 15:30:49 <Zed>	heh yeah wttr.in takes most city names without too much trouble 
Mar 14 15:31:27 <Zed>	you could be like Seattle and it would work but if you say Greenwich without the country it will choke
Mar 14 15:31:58 <Zed>	I would hardcode the country anyway because I only care about NY and CT hehe
Mar 14 15:32:32 <Zed>	I keep getting workstracted tho.. These people! They expect me to work the whole time I am here!!!
Mar 14 15:33:19 <mingdao>	April 1st will start my new job; last one ended July 10;  I welcome someone expecting me to work.  :^)
Mar 14 15:34:05 <mingdao>	Now, if I can just get "a picture (jpeg) for your building badge.  I recommend a white or blank background."
Mar 14 15:34:28 <mingdao>	I have one I want, but the background needs to be removed, whitened, or whatever.
Mar 14 15:34:43 <Zed>	ask chat gpt to do it'
Mar 14 15:35:00 <mingdao>	https://support.apple.com/en-in/102624  scratch disk is too full to use Photoshop in Creative Cloud
Mar 14 15:36:16 <mingdao>	How would you do that with Chat GPT?  I'm logged in...
Mar 14 15:44:30 <mingdao>	https://0x0.st/HFTf.png
Mar 14 16:11:16 <Zed>	use dali
Mar 14 16:11:20 <Zed>	its a gpt tool
Mar 14 16:14:15 <mingdao>	We used to live in Dali.
Mar 14 16:14:41 <mingdao>	You mean dall-e ?
Mar 14 16:15:38 <mingdao>	Too much reading to use that.
Mar 14 16:26:35 <Zed>	yes :))
Mar 14 16:30:16 <mingdao>	I didn't see how to remove a background with dall-e in a short time.
Mar 14 16:30:25 <mingdao>	I have Photoshop available, so there's that.
Mar 14 17:24:33 <mitigate>	i thought reverting 43e5e8034 would unbreak search but no, search in long lines is still broken
Mar 14 17:25:24 <mitigate>	search should show (n/N results) (p/P pages)
Mar 14 17:25:32 <mitigate>	instead of just N results
Mar 14 17:48:03 <mitigate>	nevermind, it does. i was running a version without it
Mar 14 18:16:44 <Zed>	mingdao: https://termbin.com/bbovh
Mar 14 18:42:00 <Zed>	Any idea /p
Mar 14 18:42:06 <Zed>	whoops
Mar 14 18:43:01 <Zed>	mingdao: a better version of weather.sh with comprehensive help  https://termbin.com/rkpt (sorry folks) back on topic tmux r0XorZ
Mar 14 19:05:11 <mingdao>	Zed: Yeah, RL has overtaken me here.  curl https://termbin.com/rkpt > Zed-weather.sh
Mar 14 19:16:27 <bagatur>	is there a way to achieve `attach -c` on window level?
Mar 14 19:16:42 <bagatur>	so each new pane will begin at window specific working directory
Mar 14 20:02:27 <slim>	bagatur: -c flag works with new-window and split-window - if you want it to be something persistent, you could add something like -c "#{pane_current_path}" to you split-window binds
Mar 14 20:04:46 <bagatur>	slim: yes it does but shortcuts default to session working directory (e.g C-b-")
Mar 14 20:06:11 <bagatur>	I usually keep the working directory same within a window so that'd be very useful for me
Mar 14 20:07:14 <bagatur>	another workaround I can do is to use terminal tabs along with different tmux sessions, but I lose the consistent C-b switches there
Mar 14 20:07:33 <slim>	right, so adding the split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}" to your C-b-" bind would achieve that, no?
Mar 14 20:09:06 <slim>	once the window is in the working directory, splitting it with that command would keep the working directory the same for that window
Mar 14 20:09:33 <bagatur>	yes that sounds good thanks!
Mar 14 20:09:57 <bagatur>	still a newbie with tmux here
Mar 14 20:10:24 <slim>	all good, cheers
Mar 14 20:47:42 <Zed>	we all were and once you get good with it bagatur you will set it and forget it and then three years from now you will be all wtf did I do here and start all over ;)
Mar 14 20:50:36 <bagatur>	:D
Mar 15 00:53:52 <artix_live_1>	hello guys! I wanted to ask if you know of any plugin/script that can directly copy the output of commands (being listed by dmenu or through whatever means). Ty in advance
