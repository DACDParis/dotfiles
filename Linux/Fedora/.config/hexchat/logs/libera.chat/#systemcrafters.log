Dec 11 09:15:01 <SummerEmacs>	how's the fam?
Dec 11 09:15:16 <daviwil>	slow monday here
Dec 11 09:15:34 <daviwil>	we're doing alright, mom and baby still have respiratory symptoms but doing OK despite that
Dec 11 09:15:34 <SummerEmacs>	are you ok tho? how's the baby? how's the wife and the other lil kid?
Dec 11 09:15:38 <SummerEmacs>	ooh ok

Dec 11 09:15:55 <daviwil>	slowly, yeah
Dec 11 09:15:58 <SummerEmacs>	ok
Dec 11 09:15:58 <daviwil>	we're still testing positive
Dec 11 09:16:10 <SummerEmacs>	well you will probably for another few days i imagine.
Dec 11 09:16:17 <SummerEmacs>	it can take like 2 weeks to get rid of it i think
Dec 11 09:16:22 <daviwil>	lame virus
Dec 11 09:16:34 <SummerEmacs>	yea! it sucks!
Dec 11 09:16:39 <SummerEmacs>	it shut the bloody world down!
Dec 11 09:16:42 <SummerEmacs>	it should be banned.
Dec 11 09:17:02 <SummerEmacs>	we should ban that virus legally so that it will get arrested if it ever tries anything ever again!
Dec 11 09:17:35 <SummerEmacs>	but i'm glad things are slowly improving
Dec 11 09:18:01 <SummerEmacs>	the wind on the mont saint-michel was CRAZY btw
Dec 11 09:18:03 <SummerEmacs>	like super crazy
Dec 11 09:18:10 <SummerEmacs>	like gale force winds!
Dec 11 09:18:19 <SummerEmacs>	but it was a great time
Dec 11 09:18:45 <daviwil>	kinda scary!
Dec 11 09:18:56 <SummerEmacs>	haha no it was great
Dec 11 09:19:13 <SummerEmacs>	i dunno if you know what it is lemme show you hang on

Dec 11 09:19:38 <SummerEmacs>	really really famous place
Dec 11 09:20:09 <SummerEmacs>	we also saw the Bayeux tapestry
Dec 11 09:20:12 <SummerEmacs>	which was soooo cool
Dec 11 09:20:28 <SummerEmacs>	well i've seen it all before but it was so cool to see it with my parents

Dec 11 18:21:33 <Fade>	mortadella
Dec 11 18:23:07 <piethesailor>	Okay, just restarted my machine and got sent to the login grey background, but it freezes and I get dropped into BusyBox v1.3 ubilt in shell
Dec 11 18:23:19 <piethesailor>	and the prompt is (initramfs)
Dec 11 18:23:44 <piethesailor>	help lists a number of available commands
Dec 11 18:23:52 <Fade>	now, you get to google.
Dec 11 18:23:56 <piethesailor>	indeed
Dec 11 18:24:15 <SummerEmacs>	or ping daviwil
Dec 11 18:24:35 <piethesailor>	I'll see if I can do it myself first
Dec 11 18:25:11 <Fade>	it sounds to me like guix didn't correctly configure and install the bootloader.
Dec 11 18:26:36 <Fade>	it's interesting that it works intermittently.
Dec 11 18:27:07 <piethesailor>	Fade. I guess I need to figure out the command for getting the logs here
Dec 11 18:27:28 <Fade>	if you're sitting at the initrd prompt, it didn't find the root file system.
Dec 11 18:27:34 <SummerEmacs>	getting ready to go out
Dec 11 18:28:17 <piethesailor>	I suppose initrd and initramfs are more or less the same thing
Dec 11 18:28:44 <Fade>	read the docs, my good man :)
Dec 11 18:28:50 <piethesailor>	will doo
Dec 11 18:30:27 <Fade>	this is the fun part!

Dec 11 18:35:55 <Fade>	also, Going to California and Tangerine
Dec 11 18:35:59 <SummerEmacs>	yup
Dec 11 18:37:13 <SummerEmacs>	we're supposed to have gone already but dad won't turn it off u ntil the song is over lol
Dec 11 18:37:22 <Fade>	the ringtone on my phone for my wife is "Kashmir"
Dec 11 18:37:24 <SummerEmacs>	so we're waiting 🤣 
Dec 11 18:37:31 <SummerEmacs>	haha awesome i LOVE kashmir
Dec 11 18:37:36 <Fade>	ditto :D
Dec 11 18:37:58 <Fade>	have you watched "It Might Get Loud"?
Dec 11 18:38:16 <SummerEmacs>	nope i never have but i know about it
Dec 11 18:38:22 <SummerEmacs>	i should put it on my list but you'll have to remind me later tho
Dec 11 18:38:36 <Fade>	watching Page play Kashmir for the Edge and Jack White was really something. 
Dec 11 18:38:45 <Fade>	I want one of those danelectro lipstick guitars.
Dec 11 18:38:57 <SummerEmacs>	ok it just finished!
Dec 11 18:38:59 <Fade>	I'd keep it in that tuning for just that purpose.
Dec 11 18:39:01 <SummerEmacs>	we're going i'll see you later!
Dec 11 18:39:04 <Fade>	ciao
Dec 11 18:39:06 <SummerEmacs>	🤗 
Dec 11 19:03:13 *	Fade cues up Boards of Canada
Dec 11 19:03:23 <Fade>	which is precisely the kind of asteroid music which is good for hacking
Dec 11 19:11:33 <piethesailor>	A check in, Fade, I sent exit to that shell. and I got some output:
Dec 11 19:11:48 <piethesailor>	Gaveup waiting for root file system device. Common problems
Dec 11 19:12:06 <piethesailor>	boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)
Dec 11 19:12:20 <piethesailor>	check rootdelay
Dec 11 19:12:35 <Fade>	the bootloader is looking for the root filesystem on a disk that doesn't exist since you wiped out Pop_OS
Dec 11 19:12:40 <Fade>	</guess>
Dec 11 19:12:44 <piethesailor>	and missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev
Dec 11 19:13:05 <piethesailor>	right
Dec 11 19:13:32 <piethesailor>	I also get: ALERT UUID=xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx does not exist. dropping to a shell
Dec 11 19:13:32 <Fade>	typically the solution to that is to boot the machine using the installation media, mount the actual root device, and chroot to it.
Dec 11 19:14:02 <Fade>	once you have created the chroot, you can install grub on the machine or whatever passes for grub on an efi system 
Dec 11 19:14:11 <Fade>	I'm assuming a new system76 laptop uses efi.
Dec 11 19:14:16 <piethesailor>	mine did
Dec 11 19:14:54 <Fade>	the process to do this is common, but you can look at either gentoo or arch linux documentation on how to manually mount chroot, and install the (corrected) bootloader.
Dec 11 19:15:32 <Fade>	now, there may be some guix specific suggestions which would be more expedient, but I do not know what they are.
Dec 11 19:16:51 <piethesailor>	I might enter the usb stick and run through the install process to see if there is an option for setting this up as part of the process, that I missed
Dec 11 19:17:19 <Fade>	you could try to zero the disk, by catting /dev/zero to /dev/sdX 
Dec 11 19:17:31 <Fade>	then just repartition and go again.
Dec 11 19:17:54 <Fade>	you'd have to do this from the bootable install media, obviously
Dec 11 19:18:26 <Fade>	that should kill every remaining vestige of pop_os on the machine
Dec 11 19:19:43 <daviwil>	piethesailor: You need to use `sudo` for `herd status` because Shepherd will look for a user-level instance without it
Dec 11 19:19:45 <Fade>	also any data the disk ever held
Dec 11 19:20:04 <Fade>	ah, an expert
Dec 11 19:20:09 *	Fade defers to daviwil 
Dec 11 19:20:27 <daviwil>	piethesailor: This path tells me it's looking for a user Shepherd: /run/usr/1000/shepherd/socket
Dec 11 19:25:17 <sahil_>	I am taking notes on emacs, vim+tmux sshed in 4 VMs running in qemu, compiling libreoffice-dev (full cpu utilization), and 2 monitors. Arch btw, and Guess what, it's running faster than windows ideal. :) this is life.
Dec 11 19:25:56 *	Fade listens to sahil_'s computer sizzle across the internet
Dec 11 19:48:19 <piethesailor>	Hi daviwil! I am not sure if you've read any of my isues following what you responded to. Rebooting guix after following your full guix install video, the login screen hangs as a grey screen and then falls into the BusyBox shell. 
Dec 11 19:49:01 <piethesailor>	Fade has a good point that it looks like guix is unable to find the root file system. 
Dec 11 19:49:42 <piethesailor>	And maybe that is due to (I am on a System76 Pop_os machine) pop os boot loader getting in the way here.
Dec 11 19:49:55 <daviwil>	Yeah, Guix does not use BusyBox, so that might be a clue
Dec 11 19:54:54 <Fade>	I was guessing from imperfect information
Dec 11 19:55:25 <piethesailor>	During the guix install process, is there a way to eliminate the Pop_os bootloader? I went with the clear all partitions and install guix, but obviously left behind the bootloader. I can follow Fades advice above:
Dec 11 19:55:35 <piethesailor>	 <Fade>typically the solution to that is to boot the machine using the
Dec 11 19:55:36 <piethesailor>	       installation media, mount the actual root device, and chroot to it.
Dec 11 19:55:36 <piethesailor>	<Fade> once you have created the chroot, you can install grub on the machine
Dec 11 19:55:36 <piethesailor>	       or whatever passes for grub on an efi system 
Dec 11 19:56:47 <piethesailor>	you can look at either gentoo or
Dec 11 19:56:47 <piethesailor>	       arch linux documentation on how to manually mount chroot, and install
Dec 11 19:56:47 <piethesailor>	       the (corrected) bootloader.
Dec 11 19:56:50 <Fade>	I'm kind of an old fashioned sysadmin; for all I know there's a big "Press This Big Red Button To Save Your Installation!" button on the desktop.
Dec 11 19:57:09 <Fade>	which will automagically do pretty much what I described.
Dec 11 19:57:27 <Fade>	in any event, all of my advice should be superseded by whatever daviwil thinks.
Dec 11 20:10:52 <daniel42>	hi
Dec 11 20:11:33 <daniel42>	i think i am sasled and znced now , am i?
Dec 11 20:12:22 <Fade>	did this involve a whole velvet bag full of Swarovski Crystals? :D
Dec 11 20:14:00 <daviwil>	I'm definitely salsa'd
Dec 11 20:17:47 <Kolev>	I'm tea'd. Stomach is tanned.
Dec 11 20:18:06 <daniel42>	no forgot to verify email
Dec 11 20:18:19 <daniel42>	i think now i am sasled and znced
Dec 11 20:18:57 <daviwil>	daniel42: yes, you seem to be logged in and using ZNC
Dec 11 20:19:10 <daniel42>	thx dave

Dec 11 20:20:25 <Fade>	how long is the oracle free tier free?
Dec 11 20:20:35 <daniel42>	forever

Dec 11 20:31:23 <tdback>	Pretty sure they made it available only to paying users, and it *technically* doesn't violate GPL
Dec 11 20:31:48 <Kolev>	You can get THIS copy of the code, but you can't get updates. Good luck.
Dec 11 20:31:59 <Fade>	:|
Dec 11 20:32:14 <tdback>	Yeah because isn't centos stream their upstream for testing and such?
Dec 11 20:32:18 <Kolev>	If you share the software: No updates!
Dec 11 20:42:39 <davisrichard437>	tdback: it was verified that restricting the redistribution of source code doesn't violate the GPL?
Dec 11 20:42:57 <davisrichard437>	if so that kind of sucks
Dec 11 20:43:28 <Fade>	that would be very surprising to me.
Dec 11 20:54:21 <daniel42>	“One of the things that we’ve identified is Red Hat’s [customer contract] prohibits you from distributing any of the sources or assets that you’re getting,” Kurtzer said. “It’s a difficult one, because they’re not going against the GPL, but they’re saying if you exercise your rights according to the GPL, we will drop you as a customer.”
Dec 11 20:58:02 <piethesailor>	For this guix install, I think I just need to format the partition 'fat32 boot.esp /boot/efi'. I would think that is where the Pop_os boot loader is. 
Dec 11 20:59:09 <piethesailor>	maybe keep or change the mount point to something guix understands
Dec 11 20:59:51 <piethesailor>	Or following Fade suggestion, find the required bootloader for guix and install it here, then install guix..

janv. 18 07:33:35 <SummerEmacs>	did you see this btw? https://yadm.io/#
janv. 18 07:33:38 <SummerEmacs>	looks interesting
janv. 18 07:33:42 <SummerEmacs>	instead of using stow
janv. 18 07:34:34 <SummerEmacs>	it even has an entry for managing it with magit
janv. 18 07:36:21 <cow_2001>	i just throw my dotfiles into a dotfile repository where they gather dust and additional layers of files upon additional layers of files, like some sort of an ancient archaeological digging site
janv. 18 07:37:26 <SummerEmacs>	i have a synced folder for my dotfiles but i'm wondering if i'm doing it the hard way? only, i don't really have that many dotfiles tbh. i got like 20 files in that folder at most.
janv. 18 07:37:43 <SummerEmacs>	but maybe i should be using this sytem or maybe stow? i dunno.
janv. 18 07:39:09 <cow_2001>	i'm not the one to ask.  my way is TERRIBLE.
janv. 18 07:39:47 <SummerEmacs>	hehe
janv. 18 07:39:49 <SummerEmacs>	sounds like my way
janv. 18 07:39:59 <SummerEmacs>	just symlink by hand (with dired) to a folder
janv. 18 07:40:16 <cow_2001>	been thinking of this guix home thing, but i'm too scared to use it.  what if it'll overwrite something and the world would explode?!
janv. 18 07:40:29 <SummerEmacs>	it might do some damage.
janv. 18 07:41:33 <cow_2001>	i don't even symlink.  i have the working copy and the repository copy and when i change it in the working copy until i remember i need to keep track of my stuff, so i copy it over the repository copy and commit the changes
janv. 18 07:41:45 <SummerEmacs>	there i finished refiling all the fashion stories for the day
janv. 18 07:41:56 <SummerEmacs>	oh i have a symlink in my home directory
janv. 18 07:42:11 <SummerEmacs>	and then i sync the dotfiles folder
janv. 18 07:45:12 <cow_2001>	man, i slept on my left arm, i guess, and now it's tingly
janv. 18 07:45:33 <cow_2001>	alternatively, i have fatal neurodegeneration
janv. 18 07:45:39 <SummerEmacs>	if your arm isn't back to un-tingly then you have a circulation problem
janv. 18 07:45:58 <cow_2001>	huh
janv. 18 07:46:00 <cow_2001>	rip
janv. 18 07:46:01 <SummerEmacs>	yea
janv. 18 07:46:19 <SummerEmacs>	well you can check. do a little exercise with your arm for a minute or two. the blood flow should come back normally.
janv. 18 07:46:38 <SummerEmacs>	if not, i'd go check with a doctor cuz if it doesn't come back after a little while, it might be worth looking into ok?
janv. 18 07:47:05 <cow_2001>	...
janv. 18 07:47:32 <trev>	cows need a vet sometimes
janv. 18 07:47:38 <trev>	and to graze in the pasture 
janv. 18 07:49:06 <cow_2001>	okay, the internet says i'm dead
janv. 18 07:49:22 <SummerEmacs>	yea
janv. 18 07:49:28 <SummerEmacs>	but you're not dead
janv. 18 07:49:46 <SummerEmacs>	but if you're still tingly after a few mins and even an hour later, i'd go see a doctor. really.
janv. 18 07:49:58 <SummerEmacs>	i mean it could be nothing but it could be something you might want to take care of.
janv. 18 07:51:48 <cow_2001>	huh cervical spine problems
janv. 18 07:52:14 <cow_2001>	maybe
janv. 18 07:52:17 <cow_2001>	who knows
janv. 18 07:52:25 <SummerEmacs>	it depends
janv. 18 07:52:32 <SummerEmacs>	i'd see a doctor if it's still going on tbh

janv. 18 11:58:04 <naokotani>	His moustache was OP
janv. 18 11:58:15 <naokotani>	that article is hilarious for so many reasons

janv. 18 12:35:46 <trev>	i made hot cocoa like SummerEmacs was talking about

janv. 18 12:37:21 <daviwil>	sounds pretty good
janv. 18 12:38:07 <trev>	it is pretty cozy if i ignore the fact that my eyes are burning from staring into the computer for hours like a maniac
janv. 18 12:38:21 <daviwil>	sounds like a regular day
janv. 18 12:39:45 <trev>	daviwil: ever look at scsh (scheme shell)?
janv. 18 12:40:17 <daviwil>	not really, have you?
janv. 18 12:41:11 <trev>	nah, just came across it when looking into some shell stuff. it's written in scheme48
janv. 18 12:41:33 <trev>	never heard of that one, but the idea is pretty neat and the source code has funny comments
janv. 18 12:42:57 <daviwil>	Scheme48 is cool because its bytecode interpreter is written in a Scheme dialect called PreScheme which compiles directly to native code: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_48#Implementation
janv. 18 12:43:02 <daviwil>	statically typed too
janv. 18 12:48:08 <trev>	seems cool. died cause he didn't write any docs for it lol
janv. 18 12:51:24 <trev>	i went into a rabbit hole on shells and to me the scripting part seems so messed up from a programming language perspective. i thought "scheme would probably be a better replacement" and then saw scsh
janv. 18 12:51:55 <daviwil>	shell script is pretty awful, but the benefit is that it runs on pretty much any *NIX
janv. 18 12:52:38 <daviwil>	Fennel could be pretty interesting for scripty tools though because you can generate a standalone executable from a Fennel script
janv. 18 12:52:43 <trev>	yeah until you're like me and write them using bash-isms and they don't work on BSD or dash
janv. 18 12:52:48 <daviwil>	yeah
janv. 18 12:52:50 <daviwil>	that part sucks
janv. 18 12:52:56 <daviwil>	I try to avoid Bash-specific patterns
janv. 18 12:54:03 <trev>	i was actually looking at converting some of my bash scripts into lua, but it hurts to take a nice 5 line bash script that i spent like 6 hours on and ruin it

févr. 12 15:29:07 <naokotani>	I really need to make a shell script or somethign to add sudo to the previous command
févr. 12 15:29:19 <trev>	zsh has a plugin for that
févr. 12 15:29:32 <naokotani>	about 50% of the commands I enter are the last command I wrote + sudo
févr. 12 15:30:14 <trev>	up, ctrl a and typing sudo usually is ok for me
févr. 12 15:30:30 <naokotani>	I got some end to end testing going for my website. I used puppeteer to iteratively submit form data and then mocha to assert the json data
févr. 12 15:30:44 <trev>	wow awesome
févr. 12 15:30:52 <naokotani>	I actaully found a bug. for some reason it fails for a big bad evil guys above level 18
févr. 12 15:31:11 <naokotani>	haven't looked into why. that was enough for me for a sunday
févr. 12 15:32:42 <naokotani>	man, typescript feels so janky after working with rust and needing to pull in outside libraries to do testing is kind of cursed
févr. 12 15:33:26 <alternateved>	Meanwhile bash has sudo !! 
févr. 12 15:33:30 <naokotani>	maybe janky is an exaggeration
févr. 12 15:33:42 <naokotani>	oh really?
févr. 12 15:33:48 <naokotani>	sudo !! does the last command with sudo?
févr. 12 15:33:54 <trev>	 yeah basically every programming language feels like that now for me
févr. 12 15:33:57 <alternateved>	Supposedly
févr. 12 15:34:06 <naokotani>	lets find out
févr. 12 15:34:11 <trev>	forgot about that one
févr. 12 15:34:44 <naokotani>	alternateved: you just saved me about an hour a week
févr. 12 15:34:45 <trev>	works on zsh too
févr. 12 15:34:58 <alternateved>	naokotani: haha, nice!
févr. 12 15:35:08 <naokotani>	yeah works on bash in ubuntu 22
févr. 12 15:35:20 <naokotani>	idk if its in the bashrc though
févr. 12 15:35:26 <naokotani>	or, if its something with sudo itself?
févr. 12 15:36:17 <naokotani>	Anyway, I need to take my dog snow shoeing or she's going to leave me for another owner
févr. 12 15:36:20 <naokotani>	ttyl 
févr. 12 15:36:39 <alternateved>	naokotani: it's a shell feature
févr. 12 15:36:59 <alternateved>	https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#History-Interaction
févr. 12 15:37:08 <alternateved>	History expansion
févr. 12 15:37:49 <naokotani>	I guess its not surprising that someone encountred this problem and fixed it about 40 years ago
févr. 12 15:38:24 <alternateved>	Haha, totally
févr. 12 15:38:27 <naokotani>	still, I kind of want to write a script called "sudont" that does it 
févr. 12 15:38:50 <naokotani>	no no, "sudidnt"
févr. 12 15:39:33 <naokotani>	"sushouldacouldawoulda"
févr. 12 15:39:36 <alternateved>	Just write an alias for sudo: alias please=sudo
févr. 12 15:40:29 <naokotani>	you could make it please and if there are no arguments it will add sudo to the last command
févr. 12 15:41:16 <naokotani>	which woul dbe funny because its like, you write the command, it fails and yells at you, and you just write please and it works
févr. 12 15:41:51 <naokotani>	and then alias "pretty please with sugar on top" to do the exact same thing
févr. 12 15:51:53 <alternateved>	Well, there is this: https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck

Feb 20 15:55:58 <Fade>	(did I try to debug a problem you weren't asking for help with?)
Feb 20 15:59:49 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Sorry, I'm at work and was busy ^^"
Feb 20 16:00:27 <fyrfaras`>	I just can't tell my boss to wait in line, because IRC is more important xD
Feb 20 16:00:52 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Unfortunatelly, that somebody is me x3c
Feb 20 16:02:01 <fyrfaras`>	The firewall lets everything through and keeps the state for the session. 
Feb 20 16:02:22 <fyrfaras`>	I will check the client logs of both sites.
Feb 20 16:04:59 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: And no, I'm glad and bunny grateful that you want to help me ^w^
Feb 20 16:07:47 <Fade>	http status cats: https://boingboing.net/2011/12/14/http-status-cats-by-girliemac.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+boingboing%2FiBag+(Boing+Boing)

Feb 20 16:09:36 <Fade>	http status cats: https://boingboing.net/2011/12/14/http-status-cats-by-girliemac.html
Feb 20 16:09:39 <Fade>	there :)
Feb 20 16:20:11 <Fade>	so, say you have a database of many thousands of urls, and you'd like to present them in a useful way
Feb 20 16:20:17 <Fade>	what does that look like?
Feb 20 16:34:46 <benoitj>	is girliemac related to SummerEmacs?
Feb 20 16:35:24 <Fade>	not to my knowledge. this link was recorded in 2011, when Summer would have been... 10, or 11?
Feb 20 16:35:53 <Fade>	she's precocious, but I doubt she was meming yet. :)
Feb 20 16:36:11 <benoitj>	oh
Feb 20 16:36:17 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 20 17:08:24 <dthompson>	to add to the drew saga, he's banned from lobste.rs apparently https://lobste.rs/s/vplgi1/hare_0_24_0_released_hare_s_new_release#c_dg2mzs
Feb 20 17:11:18 <Fade>	drew saga?
Feb 20 17:12:14 <Fade>	which bubble is this saga presenting upon?
Feb 20 17:18:48 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: I'm unable to check the logs on client A.
Feb 20 17:19:03 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: But the admin for this box is in the office tomorrow.
Feb 20 17:20:05 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: client B is a windows box with win 7 and the program which uses ssh is a self-built thingy by the aforementioned admin of client A.
Feb 20 17:22:03 <Fade>	there are many parts moving against each other in the scenario you have described.
Feb 20 17:22:36 <fyrfaras`>	indeed... my firewall lets everything pass.
Feb 20 17:22:44 <Fade>	it sounds to me like the firewall is closing tcp streams aggressively, maybe due to what it percieves as an absence of traffic
Feb 20 17:23:06 <Fade>	you see this kind of behaviour in old ssh daemons which relied upon a keepalive 
Feb 20 17:23:18 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: eventhough traffic is flowing?
Feb 20 17:23:24 <fyrfaras`>	Ah, yes keepalive!
Feb 20 17:23:26 <Fade>	but that wouldn't explain why the ICMP stream between the communicating hosts allows the connection to stand up.
Feb 20 17:23:45 <Fade>	ssh traffic tends to be bursty
Feb 20 17:23:55 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: the ssh version on the windows box is 7.0
Feb 20 17:24:06 <Fade>	if your firewall is doing something bizarre with ICMP traffic, you can see weird effects.
Feb 20 17:24:11 <fyrfaras`>	I don't know the version at the other side though.
Feb 20 17:24:24 <Fade>	I won't be much help with a windows stack, I'm afraid.
Feb 20 17:24:31 <fyrfaras`>	I sea.. I will check for ICMP related settings.
Feb 20 17:24:48 <Fade>	I sould whitelist ssh traffic at the firewall.
Feb 20 17:25:17 <Fade>	and then I would audit the firewall; it sounds like you don't really know what's happening there.
Feb 20 17:25:28 <Fade>	s/sould/would
Feb 20 17:32:50 <fyrfaras`>	I diving through tcpdump now.
Feb 20 17:33:09 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: ale li jo e pona
Feb 20 17:40:25 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: Everything is going well?
Feb 20 17:41:04 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: At the moment it's stable but I'm monitoring the ssh traffic with tcpdump.
Feb 20 17:42:49 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: yes
Feb 20 17:46:42 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Okay, we are getting closer!
Feb 20 17:47:06 <fyrfaras`>	I broke again and I see SYN packages towards client A.
Feb 20 17:47:16 <fyrfaras`>	s/I/it x3
Feb 20 17:47:37 <fyrfaras`>	But there aren't any SYN-ACK from client A back.
Feb 20 17:47:45 <dthompson>	Fade: re: drew saga, drew devault has come up here several times recently. has made some inflammatory remarks about emacs users, among other things.
Feb 20 17:48:11 <Fade>	all I know about him is that he's the sourcehut guy
Feb 20 17:48:27 <Fade>	I would be happy to read any linkage you happen to have.
Feb 20 17:49:14 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: I suppose client A is behaving shady. But I'm not able to take a look into that box. Hence I need to wait until tomorrow. But anybun, thank you bunny much for your advice and help :3 !!
Feb 20 17:49:36 <Fade>	I'd put a linux machine in network A and another one in network B and see if the problem persists.
Feb 20 17:49:42 <Fade>	between those two hosts.
Feb 20 17:49:51 <Fade>	or a BSD machine. whatever.
Feb 20 17:49:57 <fyrfaras`>	Good idee!
Feb 20 17:50:05 <fyrfaras`>	s/idee/idea
Feb 20 17:50:43 <Fade>	the fact that it's windows and some windows application doing ssh daemon service is a cause of some suspicion. :)
Feb 20 17:52:38 <Fade>	this arrangement indicates some deleterious thinking, even if it "should" work. 
Feb 20 17:52:50 <dthompson>	Fade: I don't have any links handy... they were shared around here some days ago
Feb 20 17:53:00 *	Fade nods
Feb 20 17:59:56 *	daniel42 nods
Feb 20 18:04:16 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Sooo, I've established another SSH connection to a different server in Net A and it works like a charm so far.
Feb 20 18:04:50 <fyrfaras`>	I'm running cmatrix(1) to get a constant output and the cmd program isn't happy about it x3
Feb 20 18:07:30 <fyrfaras`>	It looks like art combined with chaos and horrors born from the depths of of a PDP-11 long forgotten and still crunching numbers away deep deep down the lost mines of Khazad-Berkeley!
Feb 20 18:08:59 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Indeed! But it's not my machine and I'm just the firewall bunny. And I getting yelled at if some communications don't work anymore =w="
Feb 20 18:11:09 <fyrfaras`>	I suspect it's an combination of SSH versions of cosmic horrors, Windows and whatever on client A runs which is for sure as ancient as other system running around here... I mean I still need to do archives with floppies and tapes x3c
Feb 20 18:15:51 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: li pona! mi tawa li moku. mi tawa :3

Feb 20 18:18:49 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: "Fruit is sweet and good."
Feb 20 18:18:50 <cow_2001>	kilikilikili
Feb 20 18:19:02 <cow_2001>	i figgered, but wasn't sure
Feb 20 18:19:39 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: So basically "killing" means eating a lot of fruit x3 /lh
Feb 20 18:19:47 <cow_2001>	you know that sweet and sugar have shared ancestry with sukkha?
Feb 20 18:19:50 <cow_2001>	maybe not sweet
Feb 20 18:19:58 <cow_2001>	saccharine
Feb 20 18:20:14 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: What is sukkha?
Feb 20 18:20:16 <cow_2001>	fyrfaras` killing me sweetly
Feb 20 18:20:25 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: :D
Feb 20 18:20:44 <cow_2001>	i don't remember, but it's something in the Pali language
Feb 20 18:21:04 <fyrfaras`>	I need to fetch something for dinner. Be right back. Bun ya~
Feb 20 18:21:11 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: OIC :)
Feb 20 18:21:13 <cow_2001>	used somewhere in India to canonise the Buddhist writings
Feb 20 18:22:06 <cow_2001>	there's like two and two halves of continents between English and Pali, but they share origins
Feb 20 18:22:12 <cow_2001>	some origins, at least
Feb 20 18:22:22 <cow_2001>	i get goosebumps thinking about it
Feb 20 18:48:45 <daniel42>	yoga and yoke and joch have also same ancestry
Feb 20 18:49:08 <daniel42>	and also means the same
Feb 20 18:50:29 <daniel42>	The words "yoga," "yoke," and the German word "Joch" share the same Indo-European root. This root is "*yugom," which means "to join" or "to unite." This is reflected in the meaning of "yoga" as a practice of unifying the body and mind, "yoke" as a device for joining animals together to pull a load, and "Joch" in German, which also means a yoke or a beam used to connect two animals.
Feb 20 18:55:58 <daniel42>	even the word to join is,related to yoga lol
Feb 20 18:57:33 <Fade>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language
Feb 20 19:05:00 <daniel42>	would be cool if everyone could understand that.lang
Feb 20 19:15:07 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: Fascinating :3c !
Feb 20 19:15:27 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: Thanks for the explanation.
Feb 20 19:19:03 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: I set the old constellation up in parallel to the new and working connection.
Feb 20 19:19:37 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: client B still needs the constant ping to client A to keep up the communication
Feb 20 19:20:15 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: hence I my hypotheses is that there is a problem in client A
Feb 20 19:20:41 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Because the test connection to another server in net A is still up and bunning.
Feb 20 19:22:18 <Fade>	the fact that the icmp traffic between the hosts seems to keep the ssh connection alive made me think it was a problem in the firewall.
Feb 20 19:22:38 <Fade>	but you're on site, and if you have a workaround, seems like you're good. :)
Feb 20 19:23:30 <Fade>	but there are several unknowns, not the smallest of which is the TCP/IP stack in use on each client.
Feb 20 19:23:38 <Fade>	are these modern windows machines?
Feb 20 19:23:41 <fyrfaras`>	the firewall doesn't block anything and I cloned the original ruleset for the test connection which works totally fine
Feb 20 19:23:42 <Fade>	&etc
Feb 20 19:24:24 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Windows 7 Pro Service Pack 1
Feb 20 19:24:27 <fyrfaras`>	x3
Feb 20 19:24:33 <Fade>	if the connection between the linux machines is stable, then it's a software interaction on the troubled clients, potentially impacted by the firewall.
Feb 20 19:25:10 <fyrfaras`>	ah, the running test is between windows and a debian box
Feb 20 19:25:23 <Fade>	you do you :D
Feb 20 19:25:42 <fyrfaras`>	I can get my paws on the client A tomorrow ^^
Feb 20 19:26:03 <Fade>	if you have a workaround, I'd move on to other things.
Feb 20 19:26:05 <Fade>	:)
Feb 20 19:26:31 <fyrfaras`>	the workaround consists of an eternal ping in a background cmd xD
Feb 20 19:26:52 <Fade>	I bet it's keeping the TCP/IP stack on the windows machine woken up.
Feb 20 19:26:54 <fyrfaras`>	I will do :) time to watch Prot's dired tutorial!
Feb 20 19:27:23 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: maybe, I will let you know what I discovered tomorrow :3
Feb 20 19:27:28 <Fade>	also, perhaps the ssh connection from the openssh installation on the debian machine is doing proper keepalive.
Feb 20 19:27:35 *	Fade shrugs
Feb 20 19:27:40 <fyrfaras`>	again, thanks for the help <3
Feb 20 19:27:44 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: maybe
Feb 20 19:27:49 *	fyrfaras` shrugs too
Feb 20 19:28:06 <Fade>	I feel like the stop point is kind of unsatisfying, but at least your boss isn't haranguing you :)
Feb 20 19:28:42 <fyrfaras`>	it is but my shift is almost over and it works for the moment :)
Feb 20 19:29:57 <Fade>	w00t!
Feb 20 19:30:02 <Fade>	free agent!
Feb 20 19:30:23 <fyrfaras`>	free agent :) ?
Feb 20 19:30:30 <Fade>	yeah, you're free
Feb 20 19:30:36 <Fade>	(cue primal scream)
Feb 20 19:30:42 <fyrfaras`>	aaaah, yaaay :3 !!

Feb 20 19:35:12 <BigEatie>	Apparently it's a toss-up: God could have used Emacs or Vim to create the universe: https://0x0.st/H5zs.png
Feb 20 19:35:43 <fyrfaras`>	Heya~ BigEatie :3
Feb 20 19:35:48 <BigEatie>	Howdy
Feb 20 19:36:20 <fyrfaras`>	BigEatie: Did you bought a laser printer already?
Feb 20 19:37:19 <fyrfaras`>	Because since I'm bunning GNU Guix System recently I set up my Cups for our home printer.
Feb 20 19:37:30 <fyrfaras`>	It works like a charm and driverless.
Feb 20 19:38:00 <BigEatie>	I just bought one yesterday -- one of the Brother's on Amazon.
Feb 20 19:38:04 <BigEatie>	What are you using?
Feb 20 19:38:15 <fyrfaras`>	We have a Brother MFC-L2710DN.
Feb 20 19:38:48 <fyrfaras`>	And we set is up via ipp:// hence no printer driver needed :)
Feb 20 19:39:00 <fyrfaras`>	Even dublex works.
Feb 20 19:39:15 <BigEatie>	Go figure, bought a MFC-L2710DW
Feb 20 19:39:16 <BigEatie>	lol
Feb 20 19:39:36 <fyrfaras`>	I think the only difference is that your model has wifi :)
Feb 20 19:40:07 <fyrfaras`>	So there is a got chance to get it up and bunning with GNU Guix System.
Feb 20 19:40:24 <fyrfaras`>	And we can tech support each other soon :D
Feb 20 19:40:29 <BigEatie>	Pretty cool, haha
Feb 20 19:40:56 <BigEatie>	Haven't made the jump go Guix, but maybe one day -- nice that it works out of the box without any drivers necessary though
Feb 20 19:42:20 <fyrfaras`>	Before this I never knew one could run a printer driverless. We'd had some trouble with the Brother drivers, hence the stumble over this neat solution.
Feb 20 19:56:28 <fyrfaras`>	Time to bun home! Sea ya later around the chronostream :3 !
Feb 20 19:56:34 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: mi tawa

Feb 20 21:03:23 <phoxfyre>	Hello, how are yall today?
Feb 20 21:08:53 <benoitj>	hi phoxfyre 
Feb 20 21:09:21 <benoitj>	busy working for me. another 2 hours and will go to my 2nd shift
Feb 20 21:16:16 <benoitj>	about you phoxfyre?
Feb 20 21:16:49 <phoxfyre>	I am doing well, just relaxing after a long few weeks of assignments.
Feb 20 21:17:01 <benoitj>	nice
Feb 20 21:28:08 <SummerEmacs>	BigEatie: God would have used Vim. Emacs is for those of us who don't need a god to create universes of our own.
Feb 20 21:28:39 <SummerEmacs>	and hi everyone 👋 i just got back
Feb 20 21:29:41 <SummerEmacs>	benoitj: i hope you saw that as well. 😀 
Feb 20 21:29:41 <phoxfyre>	Hello Summer
Feb 20 21:29:43 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi
Feb 20 21:29:47 <phoxfyre>	How are ya?
Feb 20 21:29:57 <SummerEmacs>	feeling divine. and you? 😀 
Feb 20 21:30:00 <SummerEmacs>	i just got back
Feb 20 21:30:03 <SummerEmacs>	from the airport
Feb 20 21:30:11 <SummerEmacs>	well we got back like 30 mins ago
Feb 20 21:30:22 <benoitj>	SummerEmacs: hey!
Feb 20 21:30:31 <SummerEmacs>	benoitj: hihi
Feb 20 21:30:33 <SummerEmacs>	did you see my answer?
Feb 20 21:30:44 <benoitj>	about god and emacs?
Feb 20 21:30:46 <SummerEmacs>	yea
Feb 20 21:30:49 <benoitj>	yeah :)
Feb 20 21:31:09 <SummerEmacs>	i think that's a 🎤🫳🏻 moment
Feb 20 21:32:30 <SummerEmacs>	hi Fade 👋 daviwil fyrfaras
Feb 20 21:35:02 <alternateved>	Hi SummerEmacs
Feb 20 21:35:47 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi
Feb 20 21:36:22 <SummerEmacs>	i just got in
Feb 20 21:38:00 <fyrfaras>	Heya~ SummerEmacs :3
Feb 20 21:38:25 <fyrfaras>	Glad you are back uwu
Feb 20 21:38:53 <Fade>	Summer!
Feb 20 21:39:33 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi
Feb 20 21:39:37 <SummerEmacs>	look up a bit
Feb 20 21:39:42 <SummerEmacs>	i answered bigeatie
Feb 20 21:39:59 <Fade>	I see that
Feb 20 21:40:49 <SummerEmacs>	hehe
Feb 20 21:40:57 <SummerEmacs>	i had a lil to drink on the flight
Feb 20 21:41:04 <SummerEmacs>	free champagne so...i said yes
Feb 20 21:41:09 <Fade>	:D
Feb 20 21:41:10 <SummerEmacs>	what's up with you guys?
Feb 20 21:41:22 <Fade>	I've been bug hunting
Feb 20 21:41:34 <SummerEmacs>	i've been emailing prot from the plane half the time. i've been redoing my config completely
Feb 20 21:41:46 <benoitj>	me just working
Feb 20 21:41:49 <SummerEmacs>	he gave me some key points about it i'm gonna implement slowly tomorrow.
Feb 20 21:41:56 <Fade>	I started doing that, then I got busy with other stuff so I didn't finish.
Feb 20 21:42:44 <SummerEmacs>	i started redoing my entire file structure as well
Feb 20 21:42:52 <SummerEmacs>	it's going hand in hand with my total makeover thing i'm doing
Feb 20 21:43:08 <alternateved>	I've rewritten a part of my config to
Feb 20 21:43:08 <Fade>	very systemcrafter :)
Feb 20 21:43:36 <alternateved>	Decided to throw away my poor man's paredit for everything and instead incorporated puni
Feb 20 21:43:39 <SummerEmacs>	yea all mac based but yea
Feb 20 21:44:09 <SummerEmacs>	i'm doing a split buffer and then copy/pasting blocks to the other side to document each section clearly for myself.
Feb 20 21:44:10 <jlicht>	what's puni? 
Feb 20 21:44:15 <alternateved>	Apparently puni doesn't have to be used as a mode, I can just pick commands that works for me
Feb 20 21:44:29 <Fade>	I love paredit
Feb 20 21:44:31 <SummerEmacs>	and evaling with the tangle code so it'll make .el files for each block and won't run on an .org literate file anymore.
Feb 20 21:44:42 <alternateved>	smartparens but lighter and for every language (maybe): https://github.com/AmaiKinono/puni
Feb 20 21:45:07 <Fade>	SummerEmacs: I like that change. it's what lead me to start a new config.
Feb 20 21:45:11 <Fade>	I need to get back to it.
Feb 20 21:45:16 <SummerEmacs>	yea.
Feb 20 21:45:26 <SummerEmacs>	it'll take me a while, i'm still super busy. really really really busy
Feb 20 21:45:33 <SummerEmacs>	but i'm getting it done a little bit each day
Feb 20 21:45:39 <Fade>	nice
Feb 20 21:45:39 <cow_2001>	puni puni puemi
Feb 20 21:45:41 <SummerEmacs>	i figure it'll take me about a week or two maybe.
Feb 20 21:45:45 <SummerEmacs>	hihi 🐮 
Feb 20 21:45:49 <cow_2001>	hellooooo
Feb 20 21:46:27 <alternateved>	hi cow_2001 
Feb 20 21:47:31 <cow_2001>	i'm still stuck with paredit
Feb 20 21:47:54 <Fade>	stuck?
Feb 20 21:48:01 <alternateved>	I prefer to be explicit about removing things
Feb 20 21:48:06 <fyrfaras>	Fade helped me to tackle a strange network problem at work :3
Feb 20 21:48:07 <cow_2001>	iuno, seems like there are other stuff
Feb 20 21:48:15 <alternateved>	paredit changed editing too much for my taste
Feb 20 21:48:44 <Fade>	paredit is about structural editing, and mostly makes sense in lisp code.
Feb 20 21:48:58 <Fade>	if you aren't writing lisp code, you probably shouldn't be using paredit.
Feb 20 21:49:07 <Fade>	 /imo
Feb 20 21:49:12 <alternateved>	I'm talking about lisp code 
Feb 20 21:49:29 <Fade>	I can't really deal without paredit mode at this point when I'm writing lisp.
Feb 20 21:49:51 <alternateved>	I prefer to use explicit commands to do stuff
Feb 20 21:50:02 <Fade>	I'm not sure what you mean
Feb 20 21:50:18 <alternateved>	If I want to kill line, kill it always. If I want to kill line till the end of sexp, then I have a binding for that
Feb 20 21:51:00 <Fade>	at this point I think about editing lisp in paredit terms
Feb 20 21:51:06 <SummerEmacs>	i'm going over the next set of travel plans
Feb 20 21:51:14 <alternateved>	That provides me a bit more unified setup for lisp and for other languages where parentheses also exist
Feb 20 21:51:16 <SummerEmacs>	i won't be here friday again i'm gonna be traveling.
Feb 20 21:51:33 <Fade>	zoom zoom
Feb 20 21:51:41 <SummerEmacs>	yea
Feb 20 21:52:25 <nm0i>	I've even stuck paredit-like mode into other modes and zsh, it saves time.
Feb 20 21:53:27 <Fade>	paredit's focus is on whole lisp forms, and while I guess you could use it as a kind of electric-pair mode for js and python and C and whatnot... I don't think it'd work well there.
Feb 20 21:53:30 <fyrfaras>	SummerEmacs: Save travels :3
Feb 20 21:53:42 <SummerEmacs>	fyrfaras: ty! i'm not going yet tho. i just got home.
Feb 20 21:53:46 <SummerEmacs>	like an hour ago now i guess
Feb 20 21:55:17 <fyrfaras>	SummerEmacs: OIC, then this bunny wish will activate on your next journey automatically ;3
Feb 20 21:55:26 <SummerEmacs>	hehe ty
Feb 20 21:55:28 <cow_2001>	Fade: me too :|
Feb 20 21:55:34 <alternateved>	Fade: that's why I use puni
Feb 20 21:56:05 <cow_2001>	oh, puni puni poemy is a 2001 comedy cartoon
Feb 20 21:56:45 <cow_2001>	lambasting its director's(?) earlier work excel saga
Feb 20 21:57:00 <fyrfaras>	SummerEmacs: I'd watched Prot's intro video of Denote. I'm totally hooked and I think Prot is a adorable and lovely bun uwu
Feb 20 21:57:17 <SummerEmacs>	i told ya
Feb 20 21:57:26 <cow_2001>	you should donate to denote's developer
Feb 20 21:57:44 <SummerEmacs>	his video is what convinced me that not only denote is the way, but his way of doing emacs is the way. it also taught me to use dired and i use that ALL the time now, also with tramp (which is amazing).
Feb 20 21:57:45 <cow_2001>	just because of the pun
Feb 20 21:58:14 <SummerEmacs>	we've been emailing back and forth the last few days on my new setup
Feb 20 21:58:15 <alternateved>	What is his way of doing Emacs, Summer?
Feb 20 21:58:19 <fyrfaras>	cow_2001: puni-puni is the sound one makes while doing cute puns ;3
Feb 20 21:58:27 <SummerEmacs>	alternateved: if you have to ask, you can't afford it.
Feb 20 21:58:38 <alternateved>	lol
Feb 20 21:58:45 <SummerEmacs>	🙃 
Feb 20 21:58:52 <SummerEmacs>	i told you i had a few glasses of champagne on the plane
Feb 20 21:59:02 <cow_2001>	fyrfaras: my puns are all turgid and stale
Feb 20 21:59:21 <Fade>	turgid miscreant!
Feb 20 21:59:46 <cow_2001>	fyrfaras: like a torn turgid tree trunk after a storm
Feb 20 21:59:48 <fyrfaras>	cow_2001: Still they are lovely in their own way :3
Feb 20 21:59:59 <SummerEmacs>	lol
Feb 20 22:00:18 <cow_2001>	after typhoon.  i blew it
Feb 20 22:00:22 *	Fade sends cow off to stand in the corner
Feb 20 22:01:29 <fyrfaras>	SummerEmacs: Today I started to watch Prot's latest Dired video and I'm looking bunny forward to watch it further ^w^
Feb 20 22:01:45 <Fade>	oh, we're bunning againg
Feb 20 22:01:46 *	cow_2001 dons the pointy dunce hat
Feb 20 22:02:08 <fyrfaras>	Fade: Yesh(1) UwU
Feb 20 22:02:22 <naokotani>	today is trait day. it's like leg day for rust noobs
Feb 20 22:04:01 <SummerEmacs>	fyrfaras: watch his latest video about consult etc....
Feb 20 22:04:03 <SummerEmacs>	it's totally awesome
Feb 20 22:04:19 <naokotani>	off the hook even?
Feb 20 22:04:20 <SummerEmacs>	i've been using all of those tools for a long time now but he showed me stuff i didn't know about or use.
Feb 20 22:05:07 <fyrfaras>	Need to hop into my burrow soon owo
Feb 20 22:06:05 <fyrfaras>	SummerEmacs: That's bunsome and I will do that :3
Feb 20 22:06:05 <SummerEmacs>	i'm gonna shower in like 20 or so mins or maybe 30 mins and then get on my bed
Feb 20 22:07:54 <naokotani>	my dog just walked over with her llamacorn and dropped it at my feet so I threw it for her and she just looked at me like "Why? Why you throw?"
Feb 20 22:09:36 <BigEatie>	Dammit, accidentally exited out of the chatroom
Feb 20 22:09:49 <BigEatie>	Lost all the messages I was about to catch up on
Feb 20 22:10:01 <BigEatie>	Is there a log of this place anywhere?
Feb 20 22:10:53 <trev>	don't think so
Feb 20 22:21:11 <SummerEmacs>	BigEatie: i saved it for you
Feb 20 22:21:35 <SummerEmacs>	BigEatie: i replied to you the following:
Feb 20 22:21:44 <SummerEmacs>	BigEatie: God would have used Vim. Emacs is for those of us who
Feb 20 22:21:44 <SummerEmacs>		      don't need a god to create universes of our own. [21:28]
Feb 20 22:25:42 <BigEatie>	lol love it
Feb 20 22:26:05 <BigEatie>	Wait...I feel like this is one of those self-reference paradoxes.
Feb 20 22:28:01 <SummerEmacs>	😀 
Feb 20 22:28:07 <Fade>	ironically, during the first days of the lisp machine, the memory image in the machine was called "The Universe"
Feb 20 22:28:17 <SummerEmacs>	BigEatie: what's the link to your poll?
Feb 20 22:28:22 <SummerEmacs>	i tried to find it but i couldn't
Feb 20 22:28:54 <SummerEmacs>	Fade: the story fits. 😀 
Feb 20 22:29:27 <BigEatie>	https://fosstodon.org/deck/@BigEatie/111956632575839949
Feb 20 22:29:39 <fyrfaras>	I will now go to sleep. Nini~ everybunny :3 !
Feb 20 22:30:32 <BigEatie>	One of the best things that came out of that thread was someone linking this to me -- I'd never seen it before: https://fosstodon.org/deck/@BigEatie/111956632575839949
Feb 20 22:33:22 <SummerEmacs>	there i answered it
Feb 20 22:34:05 <BigEatie>	Benoitj: LMAO @ black holes being highly efficient garbage collectors
Feb 20 22:35:55 <BigEatie>	Anyone remember this logo: https://0x0.st/H5-8.png
Feb 20 22:36:20 <Fade>	I remember it being on my underwear when I was about ten years old.
Feb 20 22:36:23 <BigEatie>	Reddit is telling me the cornucopia never existed
Feb 20 22:36:48 <BigEatie>	Apparently that's FTL's official stance.
Feb 20 22:36:49 <Fade>	mandella freaks are trying to zero-day your brain meat.
Feb 20 22:37:14 <BigEatie>	That's a sentence I never hoped to hear lmao
Feb 20 22:37:36 <BigEatie>	And also reminds me of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6JFTmQCFHg
Feb 20 22:39:10 <benoitj>	I still have couple of tshirt with that logo
Feb 20 22:39:27 <BigEatie>	Please post proof.
Feb 20 22:39:29 <SummerEmacs>	they still make tshirts
Feb 20 22:39:43 <SummerEmacs>	they're still in business. they're just a subsidiary now.
Feb 20 22:39:46 <SummerEmacs>	i just looked it up
Feb 20 22:39:59 <SummerEmacs>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_Loom
Feb 20 22:40:03 <BigEatie>	FTL still exists, but they say the cornucopia never existed,
Feb 20 22:40:19 <BigEatie>	See, on the wikipedia page, the corncuopia is missing
Feb 20 22:40:56 <BigEatie>	From the wikipedia page: The company's logo comprises a red apple, leaves, green grapes, purple grapes, and white currants (or yellow gooseberries),[3][unreliable source?] but not a cornucopia. In July 2023, a Snopes reporter said that a search of newspaper advertisements between the 1920s and 2020s revealed none that depicted a cornucopia — this is often cited as an example of the Mandela Effect.[4]
Feb 20 22:40:56 <SummerEmacs>	yea and see what it says in the first paragraph
Feb 20 22:40:58 <benoitj>	BigEatie: yeah, that bing was quite funny
Feb 20 22:40:59 <SummerEmacs>	it never existed
Feb 20 22:43:23 <SummerEmacs>	the whole "mandela effect" is another pinnacle of stupid.
Feb 20 22:44:25 <SummerEmacs>	it's a perfect global demonstration about how a huge segment of people refuse to believe they have ever actually been wrong, or their memory is flawed.
Feb 20 22:44:55 <BigEatie>	It's just...bizarre. Some things which people collectively remember. Like an artist drew that picture, but it's exactly how I remembered it.
Feb 20 22:45:37 <BigEatie>	Like, I remember that firsthand.
Feb 20 22:46:41 <SummerEmacs>	yea but that just shows you how fallible people's perceptions and memories are.
Feb 20 22:47:24 <SummerEmacs>	here's from the wikipedia page of the "Mandela Effect": This phenomenon was dubbed the "Mandela effect" by paranormal researcher Fiona Broome, 
Feb 20 22:47:38 <SummerEmacs>	no one who has a title of "paranormal researcher" should ever be taken seriously. 🤣 
Feb 20 22:48:49 <SummerEmacs>	it's a bit like as if i went around saying that my job title was "atlantis archaeologist" 😀 
Feb 20 22:49:24 <BigEatie>	The fact that it's taken seriously by idiotic people doesn't in and of itself make it idiotic though 
Feb 20 22:50:10 <BigEatie>	I mean, I agree about the other stuff. My little kid brain thought of it as Berenstein, no big deal. I conflated some of Sinbad's work with Shaq's, I'm fine with that too. But, the cornucopia -- the fact that so many folks remember it that way, the fact that I myself remember it exactly how the artist drew it, that strains credulity in a way the others dont.
Feb 20 22:50:14 <SummerEmacs>	it does to me. it means it's a likelyhood of nearly 100% that it's idiotic and has nothing to do with "alternative realities" 
Feb 20 22:50:42 <BigEatie>	Oh, the whole alternative reality thing is dumb, I only remember reading about that vaguely.
Feb 20 22:50:49 <SummerEmacs>	no, you just misremembered like so many others. and that's fine because we all misremember every single day.
Feb 20 22:50:59 <SummerEmacs>	well that's the claim of the "mandela effect"
Feb 20 22:51:04 <SummerEmacs>	that it's "alternative realities"
Feb 20 22:51:08 <SummerEmacs>	that we're moving through them
Feb 20 22:51:13 <SummerEmacs>	it's completely bonkers
Feb 20 22:51:56 <SummerEmacs>	but what *isn't* completely bonkers is that i need a shower now before i get on my bed so imma go do that now. 🙃 👋 
Feb 20 22:53:14 <BigEatie>	If it is collective misremembrance, that's a pretty cool phenomenon in and of itself. It's such a weird detail to inject into an image.   
Feb 20 23:23:48 *	Fade yawns
Feb 20 23:30:31 <Fade>	I recognized the logo, in the vaguest terms possible, as belonging to the underwear company from childhood.
Feb 20 23:30:51 <Fade>	the cornucopia didn't seem out of place, so I assumed it was part of the actual logo.
Feb 20 23:32:20 <Fade>	the mandella effect is a kind of internet enabled hallucination.
Feb 20 23:33:38 <BigEatie>	See, in the back of my mind I always thought they changed the logo, but (I feel like) the cornucopia always stuck out to me in childhood cause I had no idea what it was
Feb 20 23:34:25 <Fade>	I see discussion of this has entered the wikipedia article.
Feb 20 23:39:08 <cow_2001>	i've recently learned of "fruit of the loom" from Rifftrax
Feb 20 23:39:30 <cow_2001>	trying to figure out what logo are you talking about
Feb 20 23:39:40 <cow_2001>	oh, bigeatie's question
Feb 20 23:40:14 <cow_2001>	brightly coloured single shade shirts and pants
Feb 20 23:48:49 <Fade>	they make t-shirts and underwear and socks
Feb 20 23:52:39 <cow_2001>	evocative name
Feb 20 23:53:18 <Fade>	the entire corporation was bought by Berkshire Hathaway in the early noughts
Feb 20 23:53:18 <Kingsy>	anyone around? looking for some guix advice
Feb 20 23:53:30 <Fade>	and now I know more about Fruit of the Loom than I ever needed to know.
Feb 20 23:57:17 <Fade>	Kingsy: ask and you may receive an answer
Feb 20 23:57:29 <Fade>	IRC is asyncronous. :)
Feb 20 23:57:55 <Kingsy>	if I am just using base-packages and xorg-server what else do I need to properly run gtk, qt etc etc apps? gsettings seem to be missing for one
Feb 20 23:59:06 <Fade>	have you tried installing it?
Feb 20 23:59:29 <Fade>	I don't use guix as a distribution, only a package manager, so I'm afraid I don't have much advice.
Feb 21 00:00:39 <Kingsy>	yeah but it just raises more questions, do I need dconf for example instead. or both.
Feb 21 00:05:57 <Kingsy>	Settings schema 'org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser' is not installed <- for example
Feb 21 00:06:35 <Kingsy>	this is after install gsettings and dconf. so it just makes me think there culd be a huge list of items I am missing. the guix documentation is TERRIBLE :D

Feb 21 01:05:55 <Kingsy>	Fade: if you have used the package manager perhaps you canhelp with this one, which package contains the binary "dbus-run-session" ?
Feb 21 01:09:49 <Kingsy>	ah nm
Feb 21 01:33:11 <tdback>	hey crafters!
Feb 21 02:38:13 <benoitj>	tdback: hey
Feb 21 02:51:09 <nyovella>	Good (late) evening, this time from the comfy laptop, rather than desktop
Feb 21 03:06:21 <talos>	Yo
Feb 21 03:14:41 <benoitj>	hi talos 
Feb 21 03:14:46 <benoitj>	hey nyovella 
Feb 21 03:15:16 <talos>	Yo Benoitj
Feb 21 03:16:35 <talos>	Today I realized I need a backup server for zfs snapshots, but that might take a bit to get for me lol, just gotta save monies 
Feb 21 03:16:53 <benoitj>	talos: making progress in my nix flake setup. I'm done with the OS part for my laptop (milhouse): https://git.sr.ht/~benoit/dotfiles/tree/main/flake.nix#L1
Feb 21 03:17:47 <benoitj>	great about your zfs backup. I think mine is an old i3 1st or 2nd gen
Feb 21 03:18:14 <benoitj>	probably one of my 15 years old desktop, or maybe my father's old desktop
Feb 21 03:18:36 <talos>	Cool!
Feb 21 03:19:55 <cow_2001>	do you all seed to 2.0?
Feb 21 03:27:23 <benoitj>	cow_2001: ?
Feb 21 03:28:01 <cow_2001>	ratio 2.0
Feb 21 03:33:09 <benoitj>	I guess I missed something. totally no clue what you are talking about
Feb 21 03:33:13 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 21 03:34:03 <talos>	Same 
Feb 21 03:35:03 <cow_2001>	you know, when torrenting gnu plus linux distributions ;p
Feb 21 03:36:47 <benoitj>	oh, I dont torrent
Feb 21 03:37:11 <benoitj>	I only use it when I want to download a linux iso. with 50 connections :P
Feb 21 03:37:46 <cow_2001>	>_>
Feb 21 03:37:50 <talos>	Right now I run a server on hetzner, but I'm dissatisfied with it for 3 reasons- it runs WordPress and I dislike WordPress because of how big and complex it is, but it is simple to use. The server uses the btrfs filesystem underneath it all, I want to use zfs nowadays. And finally since it runs nixos I didn't give it enough boot space when
Feb 21 03:37:50 <talos>	rebuilding, so now like every 3rd rebuild I have to delete old systems 
Feb 21 03:39:44 <talos>	But nixos makes it "easy" to reproduce a system somewhat, so I could do that, I just remember the nightmare of dns stuff lol
Feb 21 03:40:08 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 21 03:40:38 <benoitj>	I used to have a linode, and ovh vps, but now i just self host everything
Feb 21 03:40:56 <talos>	I can see why haha
Feb 21 03:41:16 <benoitj>	I'm redoing my setup for my "services" servers with nixos instead of docker 
Feb 21 03:41:49 <talos>	Makes sense 
Feb 21 03:42:48 <benoitj>	talos: I started looking at colmena for remote deployment of my nix servers
Feb 21 03:42:49 <talos>	The only thing I run in docker currently is an irc server 
Feb 21 03:42:57 <benoitj>	do you use that or deploy-rs?
Feb 21 03:43:00 <benoitj>	ok
Feb 21 03:43:51 <talos>	Never heard of colmena 
Feb 21 03:48:19 <benoitj>	colmena allows to deploy the nixos flake using ssh
Feb 21 03:48:52 <talos>	Nice 
Feb 21 03:49:00 <talos>	I will look into it 
Feb 21 03:49:11 <talos>	Thanks for the suggestion 
Feb 21 03:49:37 <benoitj>	deploy-rs does the same
Feb 21 03:49:50 <talos>	Ahhh
Feb 21 03:49:52 <benoitj>	still finding which one is best
Feb 21 03:50:21 <talos>	If you don't mind me prodding, how do you self host your stuff 
Feb 21 03:52:25 <benoitj>	I dont mind :), beside my NAS, I have a xcp-ng node running on a dual xeon cpu, 128 gig ram. this allows me to run VMs. Right now I run two docker swarm with distributed filesystem. I like it but it's too complex. 
Feb 21 03:52:48 <benoitj>	going to keep xcp-ng with xen orchestra for the VMs, but just deploy nixos VMs
Feb 21 03:53:26 <benoitj>	for my network, I have multiple vlan, to split my network and prevent stuff that is public from seeing stuff on my intranet
Feb 21 03:56:05 <talos>	 Ooh
Feb 21 03:56:44 <talos>	How do you put stuff out onto the net itself? A proxy or something?
Feb 21 03:58:40 <benoitj>	yeah, I run ssl proxy called traefik
Feb 21 03:58:50 <talos>	Cool
Feb 21 03:59:02 <talos>	I've heard of traefik 
Feb 21 03:59:09 <talos>	Never tried it tho
Feb 21 04:00:22 <benoitj>	it also integrate with letsencrypt and my DNS host to do DNS-01 proof to get a "star" certificate
Feb 21 04:04:15 <talos>	Cool
Feb 21 04:04:43 <talos>	I will follow in your footsteps probably to save monies and have more control lol 
Feb 21 04:07:34 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 21 04:07:48 <benoitj>	my last server was built with a lot of used data center parts
Feb 21 04:10:06 <talos>	Sweet 
Feb 21 04:10:24 <talos>	I love learning things from others over irc haha
Feb 21 04:11:48 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 21 04:16:33 <talos>	Doing like 2 things at once on my phone so that's why I'm not responding so soon 
Feb 21 04:43:20 <benoitj>	oh, dont worry, doing the same. playing dayz with my daughter
Feb 21 04:53:27 <benoitj>	talos: to give some ideas of how the server was built: x8dt3 motherboard, two xeon L5640 processors (similar to 6 cores i7) giving me 24 logical CPUs, 8x16gig ram
Feb 21 04:53:48 <benoitj>	the L in the cpu model means low power
Feb 21 06:18:02 <glenneth>	Morning Folx :)
Feb 21 06:21:16 <benoitj>	hey glenneth 
Feb 21 06:21:17 <benoitj>	morning
Feb 21 06:21:44 <glenneth>	HEy benoitj o/  How are you doing?
Feb 21 06:26:08 <benoitj>	doing fine. soon going to sleep. about you?
Feb 21 06:26:55 <glenneth>	I'm doing OK thanks :) busy at the minute. All good though
Feb 21 06:31:29 <cow_2001>	i don't know what i'm doing
Feb 21 06:35:42 <cow_2001>	i have a guix package definition that does not work and i am out of my depth
Feb 21 06:37:05 <cow_2001>	if i go around like a crazyperson shoving it in people faces saying it doesn't work, i don't think i'm going to get much help
Feb 21 06:38:29 <glenneth>	Hey cow_2001 You're not the only one that doesn't know what they are doing :)
Feb 21 06:41:45 <cow_2001>	i don't even know what i don't know
Feb 21 06:42:42 <cow_2001>	if you try to guix -L . guile-cv-0.4, it fails on locating libvigra_c https://codeberg.org/kakafarm/guix-kakafarm-channel/src/branch/guile-for-guile-cv/kakafarm/packages/guile-xyz.scm#L109
Feb 21 06:42:51 <cow_2001>	how do you even make it aware of it?
Feb 21 06:43:12 <cow_2001>	it is something to do with LD_LIBRARY_PATH or somesuch
Feb 21 07:39:32 <benoitj>	cow_2001: in your inputs usually
Feb 21 07:57:34 <fyrfaras>	Good meowning :3
Feb 21 07:59:41 <fyrfaras>	Kingsy: Are you still here? Yesterday I set my GNU Guix System at work up for GNOME. Hence I could check for gsettings. IIRC I just installed gnome-tweaks to get to certain settings.
Feb 21 08:01:51 <fyrfaras>	Kingsy: Also if you run a desktop you should use %desktop-services instead of %base-services.
Feb 21 08:03:28 <fyrfaras>	BigEatie: I own a lot of band t-shirts by FTL and even my oldest from 2013 doesn't have the horn of plenty in it.
Feb 21 08:04:07 <fyrfaras>	Else they would call themself Fruit of the Horn, right :D ?
Feb 21 08:20:47 <glenneth>	Hey fyrfaras o/
Feb 21 08:23:51 <BigEatie>	Yea, the time I recall it was probably the 90sish, but who knows.
Feb 21 08:26:22 <BigEatie>	I'm totally willing to accept I have it wrong. Nevertheless I think it's a fascinating phenomenon. Take something you have a clear memory of, and try and convince yourself it's not real. Even though you know the mind is fallible, it's difficult to do. Now add to that the fact that a large number of people remember it as well. I can still accept that it's likely false given the mountain of evidence against it, but it still demands some
Feb 21 08:26:22 <BigEatie>	kind of explanation. Were there knockoffs going around with cornucopias? Something else? Who knows.
Feb 21 08:26:49 <BigEatie>	Is it some kind of collective hallucination?
Feb 21 08:37:02 <trev>	BigEatie: look at their 1978-2003 logo, it was much harder to tell what the leaves and stuff are
Feb 21 08:37:29 <trev>	also that underwear sucked. hanes was better, but i always had fruit of the loom cause it was cheap at walmart lol
Feb 21 10:06:28 <port19>	I installed nonguix yesterday and had quite a bit of trouble throughout the process. Is there a good place to link my writeup once I finish it, such that others in the community can benefit (at least from the stuff I link to in mine)
Feb 21 10:08:30 <daviwil>	port19: Definitely post it on the forum: https://forum.systemcrafters.net
Feb 21 10:10:49 <port19>	Will do, thanks for the vids motivating me to get more lispy :D
Feb 21 10:25:42 <Kingsy>	fyrfaras: yeah I am going to switch that over tonight. %base-services is just causing too many issues.
Feb 21 10:26:54 <Kingsy>	fyrfaras: did you have to install anything else? have in mind I am using xorg-server with stumpwm so no gdm package or anything. I needed to manually install gtk and things. but its still a nightmare missing an env dvar to start with causing gtk applications to crash, specifcially around gsettings
Feb 21 10:27:33 <Kingsy>	daviwil: I tried your tip with (glib "bin") <- for gsettings but that didnt help either. only referencing the gnum/store in the env var manually does the trick right now.

Feb 21 10:43:22 <daviwil>	Kingsy: I missed the discussion about the problem before, what's going on?
Feb 21 10:53:11 <Kingsy>	daviwil: I was trying to just seting a base guix installation. I didnt even want a login manager, so I just started with base-services, along with some of the key standouts such as dbus etc. Then I just installed xorg-server, xinit and stumpwm and loaded the stumpwm. Everything looked good to start with but I have big problems around gtk applications, seems there are some key env vars which are not 
Feb 21 10:53:17 <Kingsy>	set, the fix outlined here fixes xfce4-terminal -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-guix/2016-05/msg00036.html <- by manually setting GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR, however this is clearly a really dirty solution given I am referencing the gnu/store directly. it just makes me think there are some fundemental things missing! perhaps just switching to desktop-services instead of base will help but I am 
Feb 21 10:53:23 <Kingsy>	not confident at this point
Feb 21 10:58:25 <Kingsy>	anyway sorry, that was a long explanation. but the reason for mentioning your glib idea was because it was failing as you can see in the ticket with reference to a gsettings gtk schema. sepcifcally FileChooser, before this it was failing with others, so I had to install gsettings and dconf. As I said, just "finding" these things makes me think I am missing a bunch more stuff. and obviously setting 
Feb 21 10:58:31 <Kingsy>	env vars like this is not a workable solution moving forward. something is seriously wrong :D 
Feb 21 10:59:38 <daviwil>	hmmm
Feb 21 10:59:49 <daviwil>	I did run into this issue, trying to remember what I did
Feb 21 10:59:57 <daviwil>	because I also don't use %desktop-services
Feb 21 11:03:03 <daviwil>	I can't really locate anything else that I'm doing inside of my config that specifically addresses missing gsettings schemas 
Feb 21 11:03:21 <daviwil>	that env var is actually unset in my environment
Feb 21 11:03:22 <daviwil>	GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR
Feb 21 11:04:31 <daviwil>	Kingsy: do you have a value for $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR in your environment?  That would come from elogind service running
Feb 21 11:07:10 <Kingsy>	echo $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
Feb 21 11:07:12 <Kingsy>	/run/user/1000
Feb 21 11:08:11 <Kingsy>	daviwil: elogind is in my system config -> https://bpa.st/6ICA
Feb 21 11:08:36 <Kingsy>	is that output for $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR corrent? I ws expecting a bunch of stuff to different dirs
Feb 21 11:08:55 <daviwil>	that's right
Feb 21 11:09:04 <daviwil>	so your user session is running correctly it seems
Feb 21 11:09:17 <daviwil>	where did you install the glib package in the way that I did it?  home config?
Feb 21 11:10:18 <Kingsy>	moment
Feb 21 11:11:33 <Kingsy>	daviwil: https://bpa.st/J67Q <- there you go. all I did was just add it to the list of package. have in mind however in order to get to where I am now I installed a bunch of stuff manually as I mentioned
Feb 21 11:12:10 <Kingsy>	daviwil: https://bpa.st/EG5A <- namely gtk, gsettings and dconf
Feb 21 11:30:16 <alternateved>	Hello
Feb 21 11:30:51 <alternateved>	Apparently Emacs 30 is going to get completion overlay: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/completion-preview.el
Feb 21 12:01:18 <trev>	alternateved: is that like "ghost text" or something with the completion popup?
Feb 21 12:06:38 <alternateved>	trev: exactly, ghost text overlay
Feb 21 12:07:42 <alternateved>	Demo here: https://0x0.st/H5KQ.webm
Feb 21 12:10:02 <trev>	nice. i used that on neovim but turned it off recently since it was interfering when i was editing in the middle of text. it's only experimental on there
Feb 21 12:27:20 <trev>	daviwil: it's not allowed to use Guix and say "i don't remember what i did" 
Feb 21 12:28:06 <trev>	if you say that then you have to add "✅ only using Guix cuz Scheme" to your profile
Feb 21 13:06:50 <nyovella>	man, what a morning.. system wasn't booting (root pool wasn't imported), so i went and checked a lot of things, skimmed through logs.. then tried reinstalling bootloader, reinstlaled kernel, checked more things.. and at last figured out how to fix it. Deleting zpool.cache and regenerating it anew. Fun times. 
Feb 21 13:14:23 <naokotani>	decided to try diesel for this project. I really like it so far
Feb 21 13:14:26 <naokotani>	I like how migrations work
Feb 21 13:23:56 <daviwil>	alternateved: that's pretty cool
Feb 21 13:24:44 <daviwil>	Kingsy: looking at those links now
Feb 21 13:25:37 <daviwil>	Kingsy: I'd try removing the gsettings-desktop-schemas and gsettings-desktop-schemas-next packages from your "user profile" using `guix remove`, it might be conflicting with your guix home profile
Feb 21 13:26:18 <daviwil>	use `guix home describe -I` to see the list of packages installed in your home profile
Feb 21 13:26:38 <daviwil>	my advice these days is to avoid using `guix install` for anything if you use `guix home` because it can lead to issues
Feb 21 13:26:58 <port19>	I'm having a little trouble with wifi on my installed nonguix. The driver is present, but I can't see any of the familiar utilities. I have `(use-service-module networking)` in my config.scm. I could not find the docs where this is defined
Feb 21 13:27:36 <daviwil>	port19: you may need to install the utilities you're looking for, `use-service-module` only imports the `(gnu services networking)` namespace
Feb 21 13:27:59 <daviwil>	it doesn't install any packages or configure anything
Feb 21 13:29:29 <port19>	What's the procedure to get an offline package over there? Or am I better off reinstalling? What's also problematic is the installer bug that errors if I install any substantial amount of packages due to no space left on its 6GB root partition
Feb 21 13:30:31 <daviwil>	port19: is wpa_supplicant accessible?
Feb 21 13:30:33 <daviwil>	installed, I mean
Feb 21 13:31:13 <port19>	I have ip and iw. I don't see wpa_supplicant in shell completion
Feb 21 13:31:48 <port19>	Also no network manager, connman or iwd
Feb 21 13:32:31 <port19>	Oh, I think I get the semantics of use-service-modules now :facepalm:
Feb 21 13:33:35 <Kingsy>	daviwil: that doesnt help. I added gsettings because it wasnt working to attempt to fix it. so the removal of any of the guix install packages doesnt help fix my issue.
Feb 21 13:35:22 <port19>	guix package --list-installed returns nothing
Feb 21 14:38:26 <naokotani>	I had to do the github tour for class becuse all my teacher has is a totally empty account lol
Feb 21 14:38:51 <naokotani>	nice class prep
Feb 21 15:02:11 <benoitj>	hi folks
Feb 21 15:02:44 <daviwil>	hey benoitj
Feb 21 15:06:27 <benoitj>	hi daviwil 
Feb 21 15:12:51 <daviwil>	how's it going?
Feb 21 15:22:16 <benoitj>	pretty good, sickness almost gone and energy is going up. my newer nix config is getting back to shape. what about you?
Feb 21 15:23:10 <daviwil>	oh, I didn't know you were sick, glad you're starting to feel better!
Feb 21 15:23:23 <daviwil>	I'm doing well, working on the material for the final week of the Guile course
Feb 21 15:23:31 <daviwil>	it's been fun!
Feb 21 15:23:46 <benoitj>	 yeah, kind of regular cold, maybe lasting a bit long. havent been sick since I had covid in 2020. so not complaining :P
Feb 21 15:23:58 <benoitj>	wow, already final week :)
Feb 21 15:24:16 <daviwil>	I guess having teenage kids helps with not picking up all the random viruses :)
Feb 21 15:24:36 <daviwil>	my daughter has brought home probably 4 or 5 viruses already and it's not even March
Feb 21 15:25:58 <benoitj>	yeah, when they are sick, we just dont see them, they stay even more in their rooms
Feb 21 15:26:26 <benoitj>	I remember, just tell yourself she's giving you super power
Feb 21 15:26:28 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 21 15:27:06 <daviwil>	lol, that is a good way to look at it
Feb 21 15:29:21 <trev>	benoitj: do you feed them food under the door?
Feb 21 15:30:12 <benoitj>	trev: yeah, they have a trap door
Feb 21 15:32:22 <benoitj>	i'm j/k :P, it's just when they are sick, they dont feel like seeing anyone, like when we are sick. unlike young childrens that dont really understand that or dont understand they just have to wait before they get better
Feb 21 15:44:45 <talos>	Good day Crafters~
Feb 21 15:46:42 <daviwil>	hey talos

Feb 21 18:53:19 <naokotani>	how many varchars should I do for email?
Feb 21 18:53:51 <naokotani>	In your humble opininos
Feb 21 18:56:04 <daviwil>	https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3696
Feb 21 18:56:13 <daviwil>	I dunno if that has a specific answer 
Feb 21 18:57:04 <trev>	The format of an email address is local-part@domain, where the local-part may be up to 64 octets long and the domain may have a maximum of 255 octets
Feb 21 19:02:31 <trev>	anyone doing something interesting right now
Feb 21 19:02:33 <trev>	?
Feb 21 19:03:18 <daviwil>	about to play Call of Duty while ignoring a meeting
Feb 21 19:04:45 <alternateved>	Rebel
Feb 21 19:13:59 <naokotani>	yeah I think an email can be up to 377 characters
Feb 21 19:14:12 <naokotani>	which is..
Feb 21 19:15:19 <naokotani>	so thats the maximum, but I see people with conflicting views online
Feb 21 19:15:43 <naokotani>	because there is a good chance it someone's email is 300 characters you probably don't want their email
Feb 21 19:16:33 <naokotani>	trev: working on a new rust project. trying out diesel
Feb 21 19:16:47 <naokotani>	so far its super dope
Feb 21 19:25:56 <trev>	is that a web server?
Feb 21 19:26:05 <naokotani>	its SQL ORM
Feb 21 19:27:07 <naokotani>	to make the tables you it creates directorys with up.sql and down.sql and you wrote the raw sql in those files to creat and drop the tables
Feb 21 19:27:27 <naokotani>	and then you can use structs with some macros to interact with the tablse
Feb 21 19:29:11 <trev>	sounds neat. never used it. i stay far away from database stuff until forced
Feb 21 19:30:02 <naokotani>	oh many i love databases
Feb 21 19:30:11 <naokotani>	man*
Feb 21 19:30:17 <trev>	i'm going to coin the term Zero-Dataist and promote NoDataDB
Feb 21 19:30:48 <naokotani>	well, if you have to use SQL I can recommend diesel because you would barely know sql is invovled
Feb 21 19:32:09 <trev>	yeah seems more pleasant 
Feb 21 19:32:30 <trev>	i like graphql (unpopular opinion)
Feb 21 19:32:48 <naokotani>	I don't mind it
Feb 21 19:33:00 <benoitj>	why unpopular? using graphql at the right time is ok
Feb 21 19:33:12 <benoitj>	there are some languages where graphql is easier to implement than others
Feb 21 19:33:33 <naokotani>	I used graphql with web design and it was really nice
Feb 21 19:33:56 <naokotani>	It used it with a CMS
Feb 21 19:34:37 <naokotani>	my only problem was it was embeded in my javascript and I found it a pain to get syntax highlighting in emacs
Feb 21 19:35:11 <naokotani>	basically the graphql for the react component was in the component file
Feb 21 19:35:17 <trev>	probably should've put it in a separate file :\
Feb 21 19:35:53 <naokotani>	I considred it. although it felt silly to do it solely because I couldnt' get highlighting to work
Feb 21 19:37:27 <naokotani>	I was just following what the framework documentation recommended 
Feb 21 19:44:07 <naokotani>	hard to beat sql though. You know what thy say, a JOIN a day keeps the head doctor away!
Feb 21 19:45:33 <trev>	they definitely do not say that...
Feb 21 20:03:06 <daviwil>	GitHub notification: "You're invited to join the @MicrosoftCopilot organization" -- No thanks
Feb 21 20:03:58 <trev>	join and file issues about Microsoft Flightsim and say you thought you were training to be a copilot

Feb 21 20:07:08 <daviwil>	And some might say "David, what have you done to help improve software quality at Microsoft?" and to them I'd say "Absolutely nothing, friend, absolutely nothing"
Feb 21 20:08:14 *	trev jack_nicholson_nodding.gif
Feb 21 20:17:14 <naokotani>	teams seems to be uniquely bad
Feb 21 20:21:36 <trev>	i used to use it in the browser
Feb 21 20:22:03 <daviwil>	Teams is bad
Feb 21 20:24:42 <benoitj>	there is a new version that is supposed to be better
Feb 21 20:24:50 <trev>	Teams2?
Feb 21 20:25:27 <benoitj>	teams "new"
Feb 21 20:25:38 <benoitj>	that is what the icon says
Feb 21 20:25:43 <daviwil>	It's just as bad :)
Feb 21 20:25:48 <daviwil>	I'm using it right now
Feb 21 20:26:51 <benoitj>	yeah, they also changed how many people you see when in screen sharing mode with a "paging system"
Feb 21 20:27:13 <benoitj>	I was like "we're missing x on the call", but he was on the 2nd page :P
Feb 21 20:28:07 <benoitj>	At least I dont have to use webex anymore
Feb 21 20:28:14 <daviwil>	ancient technology
Feb 21 20:28:33 <trev>	woah webex...what about gotomeeting?
Feb 21 20:28:56 <benoitj>	never used that one
Feb 21 20:29:05 <benoitj>	ms communicator was pretty good
Feb 21 20:29:24 <benoitj>	did not take 1gig of ram
Feb 21 20:29:48 <trev>	benoitj: what about HipChat?
Feb 21 20:29:52 <benoitj>	or was it skype for business
Feb 21 20:30:26 <benoitj>	one of these had an HATEOS API
Feb 21 20:35:12 <naokotani>	teams new appears to actually be significanlty worse somehow

Feb 21 20:38:01 <cow_2001>	were?
Feb 21 20:38:04 <cow_2001>	i wish it were?
Feb 21 20:38:12 <alternateved>	wish you were here
Feb 21 20:38:14 <cow_2001>	tenses are too tense for me :(
Feb 21 20:38:32 <benoitj>	cow_2001: bleach
Feb 21 20:38:35 <cow_2001>	alternateved: i only remember the words as mumblings
Feb 21 20:38:51 <benoitj>	only if it's surface, if it's in it, sledge hammer
Feb 21 20:38:53 <cow_2001>	ozone and/or hypochloric acid, okay
Feb 21 20:39:03 <cow_2001>	benoitj: oh my god
Feb 21 20:39:14 <cow_2001>	oh my god
Feb 21 20:39:15 <alternateved>	Yeah, if it's in then my condolences
Feb 21 20:39:45 <benoitj>	I guess it depends on how the wall is built
Feb 21 20:39:51 <cow_2001>	concrete
Feb 21 20:39:57 <alternateved>	Dehumidifier, heat, airing the room, ozoning from time to time, maybe some anti-fungus thingies that will also poison you
Feb 21 20:40:02 <benoitj>	blocks or just solid wall?
Feb 21 20:40:10 <cow_2001>	solid
Feb 21 20:40:35 <benoitj>	fix the leak first, then anti fungus stuff
Feb 21 20:40:49 <alternateved>	fungus is also extremely tricky because it might be huge underneath :/
Feb 21 20:40:59 <trev>	cow_2001: a mushroom walks into a bar...the bartender says "we don't serve mushrooms"...he replies "why not? i'm a fun guy"
Feb 21 20:40:59 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 21 20:41:04 <cow_2001>	oh my god
Feb 21 20:41:12 <benoitj>	and it needs to dry, if you have a leak, it will never dry
Feb 21 20:41:25 <alternateved>	Yeah as benoitj said, remove the source of excessive humidity and dry the hell out of place
Feb 21 20:41:58 <cow_2001>	i wish i could just burn everything down
Feb 21 20:41:58 <benoitj>	but if it's a crack, fix the crack first. that can be done with polyuretane foam injection
Feb 21 20:42:03 <cow_2001>	i hate these creatures
Feb 21 20:43:21 <benoitj>	need to fix the root cause with these creatures, if it's leak, fix the leak, if it's general humidity, then better ventilation, if it's bathroom, exauhst fan, basement, deumidifier, 
Feb 21 20:44:28 <benoitj>	basement, could also be the french drain, then dig and fix the french drain
Feb 21 20:45:24 <benoitj>	high water table, sump pump
Feb 21 20:46:02 <cow_2001>	it's over ground.  it's the roof, i think
Feb 21 20:46:17 <cow_2001>	we had a huge buildup of water due to a clogged drain weeks ago
Feb 21 20:46:34 <cow_2001>	a bit less than a metre... twice month apart or somesuch
Feb 21 20:47:06 <cow_2001>	and then there's the humid insulation under the broken tiled roof
Feb 21 20:47:18 <cow_2001>	which was fixed, but now needs to be dried up with time
Feb 21 20:51:03 <cow_2001>	oh well! :D
Feb 21 21:11:57 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi
Feb 21 21:11:59 <SummerEmacs>	👋

Feb 21 21:15:46 <SummerEmacs>	you didn't know about those?
Feb 21 21:15:47 <cow_2001>	i've been to those biomes before
Feb 21 21:15:49 <cow_2001>	very strange
Feb 21 21:15:58 <SummerEmacs>	yea i used to play a bit when i was a lot younger
Feb 21 21:16:08 <cow_2001>	it was a good game
Feb 21 21:16:20 <SummerEmacs>	yea i still have it i just haven't played in years and years
Feb 21 21:16:28 <SummerEmacs>	but i used to love my little farms 🙃 
Feb 21 21:16:43 <SummerEmacs>	i would do vegetarian playthroughs so i wouldn't have to kill the animals
Feb 21 21:16:44 <cow_2001>	the little cows are adorable
Feb 21 21:16:55 <SummerEmacs>	it's harder at first but when you get potatoes going, you're good to go
Feb 21 21:17:10 <cow_2001>	mushroom soups don't stack :(
Feb 21 21:17:14 <SummerEmacs>	they have polar bears too!
Feb 21 21:17:21 <SummerEmacs>	yea but the bowls stack now i think? i'm not sure.
Feb 21 21:17:25 <SummerEmacs>	i think i remember that being a new thing

Feb 22 00:23:44 <benoitj>	cow_2001: if you compare people blocking sites, other sites are blocking them for the same reasons
Feb 22 00:23:59 <benoitj>	at least for the 3 I looked
Feb 22 00:25:35 <Kingsy>	if i am setting xlock in my system config with this -> https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/Xorg.html <- why would I get this error "error: slock: unbound variable" on reconfigure?
Feb 22 01:10:25 <Fade>	does slock exist on the path?
Feb 22 01:12:23 <Fade>	that's my only guess.
Feb 22 01:16:44 <Kingsy>	oh I figured it out. you need to specify each package in use-modules
Feb 22 02:15:55 <benoitj>	took me a while to understand what was going on with slock

Feb 22 14:11:33 <fyrfaras`>	Heya~ everybunny :3
Feb 22 14:12:25 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Are you there?
Feb 22 14:24:06 <alternateved>	Hi fyrfaras` 
Feb 22 14:26:08 <fyrfaras`>	Hewwo alternateved ^^
Feb 22 14:26:14 <daviwil>	hey folks
Feb 22 14:26:33 <fyrfaras`>	Hy~ daviwil :3
Feb 22 14:27:20 <daviwil>	hey fyrfaras`
Feb 22 14:27:57 <fyrfaras`>	daviwil: I wasn't able to continue the fourth exercise yet. Since I have late shift this week my free time is a bit shuffled, sorry =w="
Feb 22 14:28:24 <fyrfaras`>	I could you send my solutions for the first three, though.
Feb 22 14:28:38 <daviwil>	no worries!  you can definitely send along only the first three
Feb 22 14:28:48 <fyrfaras`>	And thanks for the review of the first weeks exercises <3
Feb 22 14:28:55 <daviwil>	I still haven't gotten around to giving everyone feedback on Week 1 yet :)
Feb 22 14:29:17 <daviwil>	I'm starting to realize that 1 week is a pretty tight timeframe for everyone
Feb 22 14:29:25 <fyrfaras`>	daviwil: Alrighty, I will put them in the thread on the forum this evening :3
Feb 22 14:30:34 <fyrfaras`>	Maybe extent the course to five sessions? So you could reduce the amount of information a bit?
Feb 22 14:31:23 <daviwil>	someone suggested on the forum to possibly have it be 8 weeks total with 2 weeks between sessions to give people more time to absorb the information and work on exercises
Feb 22 14:31:34 <daviwil>	still 4 sessions, just more time between
Feb 22 14:31:59 <daviwil>	could just give more time for procrastination though, who knows
Feb 22 14:32:14 <fyrfaras`>	daviwil: That sounds like a neat idea, too. As long as it's possible and not stressful for you :)
Feb 22 14:32:56 <daviwil>	I think it would actually work well because it would give me more time to reviews and provide more information during the 2 weeks period
Feb 22 14:33:04 <fyrfaras`>	I think thanks to the forum peeps are able to exchange practices and ideas pretty good.
Feb 22 14:33:24 <daviwil>	yeah, though it's still a little disorganized.  there's a lot I want to improve for next time
Feb 22 14:34:03 <fyrfaras`>	And IMHO the procastination wouldn't be that strong. Our group seems really motivated to learn Guile :3c
Feb 22 14:34:12 <daviwil>	yes, that is a good thing!
Feb 22 14:34:16 <fyrfaras`>	Oh, do you know Etherpad?
Feb 22 14:34:23 <daviwil>	I have used it once or twice
Feb 22 14:35:40 <fyrfaras`>	Maybe have something similiar at the sessions? So the members are able to ask questions or show code snippets and everybunny can contribute interactively. I think the chat in ninja is a tad clunky ^^"
Feb 22 14:36:23 <daviwil>	the chat is definitely clunky.  Etherpad is a really interesting idea, thanks!
Feb 22 14:37:13 <fyrfaras`>	My girlfriend hosts a HedgeDoc instance and is really happy with it.
Feb 22 14:40:30 <daviwil>	HedgeDoc also seems really cool
Feb 22 14:40:36 <fyrfaras`>	Also there seems to be something like this in Emacs called "crdt".
Feb 22 14:40:42 <fyrfaras`>	https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/crdt.html
Feb 22 14:41:13 <fyrfaras`>	HedgeDoc has a low barrier since you just need a web browser, though.
Feb 22 14:41:34 <daviwil>	would be cool to do it all in Emacs, but that would assume that everyone uses Emacs.  Probably in this course they do, but not sure about others if I start looking at other languages
Feb 22 14:41:45 <daviwil>	pretty cool that this package exists though
Feb 22 14:42:18 <fyrfaras`>	I haven't tried it yet but it's bunny cool indeed :3
Feb 22 14:43:55 <fyrfaras`>	Kingsy: Do you still have gsettings problems?
Feb 22 14:44:17 <fyrfaras`>	Kingsy: Did you install the "glib" package?
Feb 22 14:45:15 <fyrfaras`>	Kingsy: https://www.reddit.com/r/GUIX/comments/11hz4q3/which_package_provides_gsettings/?rdt=59647
Feb 22 14:45:41 <fyrfaras`>	Kingsy: It seems that a certain person named daviwil answered that question :D
Feb 22 14:46:38 <daviwil>	lol, I don't even remember doing that
Feb 22 14:47:53 <fyrfaras`>	daviwil: A blast from the past xD
Feb 22 14:56:02 <talos>	Good day all~
Feb 22 14:56:14 <fyrfaras`>	Heya~ talos!
Feb 22 14:56:54 <talos>	Yo~
Feb 22 15:10:35 <ashraz>	daviwil: I won't join tomorrow, so that might be a perfect time to continue work on the chatbot :D
Feb 22 15:11:10 <fyrfaras`>	!roll 1e99
Feb 22 15:11:36 <ashraz>	Heh.
Feb 22 15:12:33 <fyrfaras`>	ashraz: I'm afraid that some other buns will carry your torch x3c
Feb 22 15:15:38 <daviwil>	ashraz: who is going to play the role of leftpad? :)
Feb 22 15:16:09 <fyrfaras`>	What and who is leftpad BTW :) ?
Feb 22 15:16:27 <daviwil>	leftpad is the name of a notorious JavaScript package in the npm registry
Feb 22 15:16:39 <daviwil>	https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/
Feb 22 15:17:10 <ashraz>	daviwil: Maybe I'll try to conjure a bot today evening. But I would need to make sure that I can disable it remotely. Would be a little bit too risky to just let it lose on #systemcrafters-live without any supervision :D
Feb 22 15:17:14 <alternateved>	leftpad is our lord and savior 
Feb 22 15:17:26 <daviwil>	Ashraz was mentioning it as a joke related to something else I said, but I thought he was telling me that the name of a person who subscribed to the channel was "leftpad" so I thanked this leftpad person
Feb 22 15:18:30 <fyrfaras`>	LOL xD
Feb 22 15:18:43 <ashraz>	And nowadays we thank leftpad for any glitches and/or mishaps during the stream.
Feb 22 15:18:57 <ashraz>	E.g. the hypnotic hyprland slides and evil eyes :D
Feb 22 15:23:49 <talos>	Tramp in eshell is fun, the end
Feb 22 15:24:59 <talos>	Was using it to ssh to a box on my LAN
Feb 22 15:25:37 <talos>	Nice how you can just call up dired or whatever else mode right there
Feb 22 15:26:05 <talos>	https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell
Feb 22 15:47:21 <fyrfaras`>	daviwil and ashraz: The leftpad story is really funny x3
Feb 22 16:02:19 <Fade>	Good Morning
Feb 22 16:07:53 *	Fade watches prot do a stream working on some of his packages
Feb 22 16:16:03 <daviwil>	didn't know he streamed today!  looks like it just ended
Feb 22 16:16:20 <fyrfaras`>	Fade!
Feb 22 16:16:23 <Fade>	aye. I came in late so I'm seeing the recording.
Feb 22 16:16:26 <Fade>	fyrfaras`!
Feb 22 16:16:28 <fyrfaras`>	:3
Feb 22 16:16:41 <fyrfaras`>	I fixed the networking problem!
Feb 22 16:18:23 <fyrfaras`>	Yesterday I've got access to the machine in Network A. After tinkering with some SSHD config settings I gave up but today I tcpdumped additional interfaces.
Feb 22 16:18:57 <Fade>	what did you find?
Feb 22 16:19:40 <fyrfaras`>	On the Net A side of my firewall there weren't any ACK from client A but client A received SYNs and replied with ACK BUT not through my firewall.
Feb 22 16:20:03 <Fade>	that's a pretty serious misconfiguration..
Feb 22 16:20:34 <fyrfaras`>	Turned out that client A was missing a route to client B.
Feb 22 16:21:23 <fyrfaras`>	We have multiple firewalls to different networks. And client A had only a default route to a different firewall.
Feb 22 16:21:29 <Fade>	the ICMP traffic shouldn't have found its way through the firewall either, in that case.
Feb 22 16:21:57 <Fade>	unless the second firewall was forwarding control traffic to the appropriate place..
Feb 22 16:22:13 <Fade>	I hate networking; there's a reason I'm not a network engineer any more. :]
Feb 22 16:22:16 <fyrfaras`>	Before I took over the firewall business there were ICMP redirects in place but I deactivated that behaviour at the firewalls.
Feb 22 16:24:06 <fyrfaras`>	It worked with a constant ping from client B to A since client B has a explicit route and I suppose that client A caches the routing information temporarily until the pinging stops and this route gets forgotten. 
Feb 22 16:24:52 <Fade>	that is a very peculiar behaviour
Feb 22 16:25:38 <fyrfaras`>	I've learned that ICMP redirects are not a good thing, because one can lost vital information and it blurres the transperacy within the networkk Hence the deactivation.
Feb 22 16:25:39 *	Fade blames windows
Feb 22 16:25:48 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: It's always Windows!
Feb 22 16:26:22 <fyrfaras`>	Also I did nothing wrong. It was the client A fault for not having the explicit route configured :D
Feb 22 16:26:24 <Fade>	screwing around with ICMP is generally a bad practice. it's necessary for many tcp/ip level protocol operations
Feb 22 16:26:37 <fyrfaras`>	agreed
Feb 22 16:27:06 <Fade>	frame size negotiation in particular can be a problem on a stitched lan.
Feb 22 16:27:19 <fyrfaras`>	In the end, it was still fun! Also thanks again for your help, Fade :3
Feb 22 16:27:22 <Fade>	are these firewalls connected with VPN tunnels?
Feb 22 16:27:47 <fyrfaras`>	No, it's a inside network.
Feb 22 16:27:56 <Fade>	I'm unsure how much benefit you got from anything I did. I'm glad the problem is solved, particularly if the issue was in the critical path for your boss. :)
Feb 22 16:28:14 <fyrfaras`>	A matchroska net withi the companies business network segments.
Feb 22 16:28:41 <Fade>	I was doing a VPN contract in January
Feb 22 16:28:50 <Fade>	I was feeling sorry for myself. :)
Feb 22 16:29:39 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Just chatting about it and giving some constructive and lighthearted advice really calmed my mind :) 
Feb 22 16:30:19 <fyrfaras`>	It's the journey alongside other bunnies and not the goal that is important ;3
Feb 22 16:30:43 <Fade>	I'm a very goal driven person. :D
Feb 22 16:31:11 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Oh, with what kind of VPN solution are you tortured x3 ?
Feb 22 16:31:34 <Fade>	IPSEC
Feb 22 16:31:54 <Fade>	openswan specifically
Feb 22 16:32:04 <fyrfaras`>	Well it could be worse... I guess?
Feb 22 16:32:32 <Fade>	openswan with heterogenous remote concentrators is always exciting.
Feb 22 16:32:47 <Fade>	the ipsec spec is liberally interpreted, particularly by microsoft and cisco.
Feb 22 16:33:00 <fyrfaras`>	The only VPN experience I have is with Wireguard and Cisco GRE Tunnels. 
Feb 22 16:33:19 <Fade>	the cisco vpn facility is generally sane
Feb 22 16:33:44 <Fade>	but in my case the firewall was running an ancient debian which meant that the openswan implementation was also ancient.
Feb 22 16:33:49 <fyrfaras`>	One standards multiple implementations and a lot of incompatibilties =w=
Feb 22 16:33:54 <Fade>	so I was up to my neck in the C source code.
Feb 22 16:34:17 <fyrfaras`>	Uff, that sounds adventureous owo
Feb 22 16:34:27 <Fade>	you take the money, you do the job.
Feb 22 16:34:56 <Fade>	I am long past my career as a C programmer, so there was a fairly large impedance mismatch. :)
Feb 22 16:35:10 <Fade>	otoh, emacs is a wonderful powertool
Feb 22 16:35:54 <fyrfaras`>	Emacs will save our souls :D
Feb 22 16:36:11 <fyrfaras`>	At least for those who have one x3
Feb 22 16:36:19 <Fade>	emacs is as black as my heart, but it does save my sanity from time to time. :)
Feb 22 16:36:24 <Fade>	don't tell cthulhu
Feb 22 16:36:39 <fyrfaras`>	My lips are sealed ;3c
Feb 22 16:36:49 <fyrfaras`>	And my fingers tied!
Feb 22 16:37:20 <fyrfaras`>	I hope Cthulu doesn't use IRC!
Feb 22 16:37:40 <fyrfaras`>	s/Cthulu/Cthulhu
Feb 22 16:38:00 <Fade>	the deep old ones use a five dimensional machine encoding.
Feb 22 16:38:02 <alternateved>	They do, surely
Feb 22 16:38:17 <alternateved>	But with their acolytes 
Feb 22 16:38:31 <Fade>	the type systems in their languages are uncoercible to binary.
Feb 22 16:38:55 <Fade>	otoh, I suspect they can probably just encode their thoughts in binary telepathically.
Feb 22 16:38:59 <alternateved>	Cthulhu fhtagn!
Feb 22 16:44:17 <BigEatie>	Howdy folks
Feb 22 16:44:26 <fyrfaras`>	Hewwo BigEatie :3
Feb 22 16:44:32 <Fade>	heya BigEatie 
Feb 22 16:45:46 <fyrfaras`>	Wait a minute! Does IRC actually stand for "Indirect Resurrection of Cthulhu" D: ?!
Feb 22 16:46:47 <daviwil>	it does now!
Feb 22 16:48:49 <Fade>	immanentizing the eschaton since 1981
Feb 22 16:54:19 <fyrfaras`>	And it's Finnish hence Trve Cvlt Metal \m/
Feb 22 16:55:43 <Fade>	I think I may have to cue up some Heavy Devy.
Feb 22 16:56:21 <fyrfaras`>	What's a Devy :)c ?
Feb 22 16:56:55 <Fade>	Devin Townsend
Feb 22 16:57:28 <Fade>	famously of Strapping Young Lad
Feb 22 16:57:29 <fyrfaras`>	Neat! I love the Strapping Young Lad stuff especially City.
Feb 22 16:57:59 <fyrfaras`>	Detox and Unterneath the Waves is so awesome uwu
Feb 22 16:58:25 <Fade>	are you Finnish?
Feb 22 16:59:24 <Fade>	\m/
Feb 22 16:59:25 <fyrfaras`>	Minä en suomilainen. Olen saksalainen pälättää :3
Feb 22 16:59:55 <fyrfaras`>	I'm not Finnish but I can speak some. I'm from Germany.
Feb 22 17:00:27 <Fade>	I've spent quite a bit of time in Bavaria
Feb 22 17:00:32 *	fyrfaras` listens to Suomi Finland Perkele right now.
Feb 22 17:00:49 <Fade>	but I'm an english speaking monoglot, which I wish wasn't true.
Feb 22 17:01:04 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Neat, which part of Bavaria :) ?
Feb 22 17:01:15 <Fade>	Munich and a town called Landshut
Feb 22 17:01:31 <fyrfaras`>	I'm living in the east of Germany, Leipzig to be precise ^^
Feb 22 17:01:38 <Fade>	cool
Feb 22 17:01:58 <Fade>	fix your firewalls before the russians come sniffing them. :D
Feb 22 17:02:10 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: I try xD
Feb 22 17:02:29 <fyrfaras`>	Where are you bunning from if I may ask, Fade :) ?
Feb 22 17:02:36 <Fade>	Canada
Feb 22 17:02:39 <Fade>	I'm in Toronto
Feb 22 17:02:54 <Fade>	oh, also Regensburg
Feb 22 17:03:03 <fyrfaras`>	Cool!
Feb 22 17:03:04 <Fade>	when I was in Bavaria, not now. :)
Feb 22 17:03:17 <fyrfaras`>	That would be strange :D
Feb 22 17:03:58 <Fade>	I always imagined Leipzig to be a very metal place.
Feb 22 17:04:12 <fyrfaras`>	It is :D
Feb 22 17:04:34 <Fade>	not so much as Danzig/Gdansk, but close
Feb 22 17:05:00 <alternateved>	Gdansk is a metal place?
Feb 22 17:05:31 <Fade>	well, it used to be called Danzig
Feb 22 17:05:33 <fyrfaras`>	It's funny that Mayhem was the first Metal band from the "West" to play in Leipzig after the wall fell.
Feb 22 17:05:39 <Fade>	maybe its character changed with its name.
Feb 22 17:06:06 <Fade>	I don't normally associate rabbits with metal
Feb 22 17:06:17 <Fade>	you must be an unusual citizen :)
Feb 22 17:06:18 <fyrfaras`>	Danzig = Programs written in Zig by Dan the programmer ;3
Feb 22 17:06:56 <Fade>	were you alive prior to the wall coming down?
Feb 22 17:07:31 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Still waters run deep! Everything cute and fluffy can be Metal as bug UwU
Feb 22 17:07:41 *	Fade laughs
Feb 22 17:08:14 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: No, that was before my hatchday.
Feb 22 17:08:36 <Fade>	*nod*
Feb 22 17:09:03 <Fade>	watership down is very metal, so maybe you're right.
Feb 22 17:09:55 <fyrfaras`>	:D
Feb 22 17:44:41 <daniel42>	i know glenn danzig

Feb 22 18:41:29 <Fade>	there are
Feb 22 18:41:33 <Fade>	I wrote one
Feb 22 18:41:45 <Fade>	I've seen people play D&D in irc.
Feb 22 18:42:14 <Fade>	random chatter kind of messes up any display, so it's best for games that don't require one.
Feb 22 18:44:28 <nm0i>	There were plenty of irc driven games, trivia used to be the most popular one.
Feb 22 18:46:00 <nm0i>	I used to play eggdrop arena in mid 00's quite a lot.
Feb 22 18:46:19 <Fade>	I've been working on my irc bot
Feb 22 18:46:26 <Fade>	I was going to join it here.
Feb 22 18:48:35 <nm0i>	eggdrop (irc bot) was how I got stuck in tcl for a while as a teen.
Feb 22 18:49:22 <Fade>	I remember eggdrop and it's tcl extension idiom.
Feb 22 18:49:29 <Fade>	I was never that fond of it. :)
Feb 22 18:51:54 <nm0i>	It grew very bloated by the end of its lifetime. It was a lot of things for many people, even could server as services replacement or to do ddos coordination, very strange piece of software. 
Feb 22 18:51:56 <nm0i>	Some of the scripts were so useful I ended up implementing minimal eggdrop emulator just to run them.
Feb 22 18:52:18 <Fade>	it came out of the IRC culture of the mid-nineties.
Feb 22 18:52:36 <Fade>	there were no channel or nick services on efnet back then.
Feb 22 18:52:39 <Fade>	so bots were common.
Feb 22 18:53:17 <nm0i>	Was before my time, i met IRC already with services, but I'm aware.
Feb 22 18:53:41 <Fade>	big irc networks were like open warzones back then.
Feb 22 18:53:42 <nm0i>	Nowadays services tend to be baked in, even.
Feb 22 18:53:47 <Fade>	channel defence was a real concern.
Feb 22 18:53:53 <Fade>	most bots had means to do so.
Feb 22 18:54:39 <nm0i>	irc wars lasted into early 10s on some networks
Feb 22 18:54:47 *	Fade nods
Feb 22 18:54:58 <nm0i>	to have classic experience you just needed to crast the services...
Feb 22 18:55:04 <nm0i>	*crash
Feb 22 18:55:10 <Fade>	heh
Feb 22 18:55:27 <Fade>	it has been a _long_ time since I had to defend a channel from a takeover.
Feb 22 18:55:42 <Fade>	I don't even have combat macros loaded in my client any more.
Feb 22 18:58:03 <nm0i>	libera even no longer does a port scan on you to check whether you're a proxy user
Feb 22 18:59:27 <nm0i>	as nostalgic as it sounds its probably for the best that all of this is in the past
Feb 22 19:09:27 <daniel42>	@fyrfaras in twitch chat the have bots with simple games.
Feb 22 19:15:00 <fyrfaras`>	Very fascinating! Thanks for the history Fade and nm0i :)
Feb 22 19:15:23 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: toki! sina pilin seme? :3
Feb 22 19:15:36 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: Sounds cool ^^
Feb 22 19:16:15 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: Did you know there is even a Toki Pona sign language :D
Feb 22 19:20:20 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: mi pilin ike
Feb 22 19:20:45 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: how many signs?
Feb 22 19:21:52 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: https://www.instructbot.co.uk/
Feb 22 19:22:17 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: oh, sina pilin ike seme o.o ?
Feb 22 19:22:34 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: I think for all 120 basic words IIRC.
Feb 22 19:23:40 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: mi lape lili
Feb 22 19:24:04 <trev>	what language are you both always chatting in?
Feb 22 19:24:12 <daniel42>	toki pona
Feb 22 19:24:25 <daniel42>	a lamguage with only 120 words
Feb 22 19:24:34 <trev>	conlang? nice
Feb 22 19:24:38 <daniel42>	yes
Feb 22 19:25:03 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: sina lape pona "tonight" x3
Feb 22 19:26:12 <daniel42>	but i use chatgpt to translate lol
Feb 22 19:26:36 <trev>	lol wut
Feb 22 19:27:00 <fyrfaras`>	I'm doing it the classic way by pestering my girlfriend with it until she will speak it as well >:3
Feb 22 19:28:46 <nm0i>	That's very cool
Feb 22 19:28:50 <nm0i>	It's eerie how it has almost esperanto level of comprehensiveness without prior knowledge...
Feb 22 19:29:56 <fyrfaras`>	And there is even a whole writing system x3
Feb 22 19:31:57 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: sina sona tuki tiki?
Feb 22 19:33:37 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: sona means "to know" but I can't find "tuki tiki" in my dictionary.
Feb 22 19:35:37 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: Tokiponido
Feb 22 19:39:15 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: "you know how to do?"
Feb 22 19:39:40 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: So Tokiponido is an offspring of toki pona.
Feb 22 19:39:44 <daniel42>	the "tuki tiki" conlang with only 39 words modifies Toki Pona and pushes towards true minimalism
Feb 22 19:40:04 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: Uff x3
Feb 22 19:41:03 <Fade>	get one of those keyboards with five keys on it, and you'd really be cooking with gas.
Feb 22 19:44:44 <fyrfaras`>	Or just two for 0 and 1!
Feb 22 19:45:36 <Fade>	with 39 words, I guess you could have a key for every word in your lang.
Feb 22 19:46:01 <Fade>	I guess they're novel, but I don't really understand the synthetic language thing.
Feb 22 19:46:01 <daniel42>	https://conlang.fandom.com/wiki/Tuki_Tiki
Feb 22 19:48:46 <trev>	li pula
Feb 22 19:50:42 <fyrfaras`>	I will stick with toki pona for a while before my brain wants to language hop again =w=
Feb 22 19:52:29 <daniel42>	yeah and chatgpt cant translate tuki tiki
Feb 22 19:53:07 <Motaik>	Hello everyone! New here. Been following SystemCrafters Emacs From Scratch series
Feb 22 19:53:31 <daniel42>	motaik: thats how i found it as well
Feb 22 19:53:35 <fyrfaras`>	Motaik: Welcome :3 !
Feb 22 19:53:46 <Motaik>	that's neat guys!
Feb 22 19:53:50 <Motaik>	thanks!
Feb 22 19:54:12 <Motaik>	so, how're you guys doing so far?
Feb 22 19:54:18 <Fade>	Welcome
Feb 22 19:54:25 <Fade>	everything is nominal
Feb 22 19:54:42 <daniel42>	nominal vs structural?
Feb 22 19:55:05 <Motaik>	i'm in the process of making my way over to exwm
Feb 22 19:55:12 <Motaik>	do u guys use it?
Feb 22 19:55:20 <Fade>	I do not
Feb 22 19:55:24 <Fade>	I use stumpwm
Feb 22 19:55:38 <Fade>	various people around here have used it, and a few still do.
Feb 22 19:55:51 <fyrfaras`>	I'm still at GNOME Wayland ^^
Feb 22 19:55:58 <Motaik>	never tried stumpwm, is it a dynamic twm?
Feb 22 19:56:07 <Fade>	no, it's a manual tiler.
Feb 22 19:56:08 <Motaik>	thats cool
Feb 22 19:56:45 <Motaik>	I tried a few wm so far, but decided to give exwm a try on guix
Feb 22 20:01:45 <Motaik>	gonna roll out for now. Try to enter exwm for the first time. Nice meeting u guys!
Feb 22 20:01:55 <Fade>	o7
Feb 22 20:06:49 <daniel42>	a storm is coming tonight
Feb 22 20:08:43 <daniel42>	https://www.meteoalarm.org/en/live/?t=today
Feb 22 20:19:46 <Fade>	it's insanely warm here today.

Feb 22 22:03:39 <Tru>	I was going to share my Journey of it on a website but so many already have done that, haha!
Feb 22 22:04:49 <Tru>	It is helpful for me to Study some everyday and then Post about it somewhere to keep me going well.
Feb 22 22:05:10 <Tru>	I just haven't decided where to Post about it.
Feb 22 22:06:24 <Tru>	It might be cool for us to find a Study Group doing it somewhere
Feb 22 22:11:36 <daniel42>	tru: there is also a mew js version of that book
Feb 22 22:11:42 <daniel42>	new
Feb 22 22:12:26 <Tru>	Yes, I saw that!  That might be cool to look at someday too!
Feb 22 22:13:36 <Tru>	I'm drinking a Red Bull now so I'd better get back to Studying for it to be effective there, haha!
Feb 22 22:13:45 <Tru>	Happy Hacking Everyone!
Feb 22 22:17:32 <cow_2001>	noooo tru went away.  was going to write: "i don't take notes in classes because a billion people took notes of the same topics before me"
Feb 22 22:18:02 <cow_2001>	as a counter argument
Feb 22 22:18:07 <cow_2001>	ad absurdum is fun
Feb 22 22:32:49 <chuck>	I have been watching the videos and trying to follow along with the SICP PDF. 
Feb 22 22:33:26 <chuck>	the vidoes are very low rez.
Feb 22 22:49:38 <cow_2001>	chuck: no, they're lofi
Feb 22 22:50:02 <cow_2001>	OG lofi
Feb 22 22:51:09 <cow_2001>	listen to the opening music!
Feb 22 23:41:47 <BigEatie>	daviwil: just FYI, some of your show-note links don't seem to be working i.e. https://new.systemcrafters.net/live-streams/may-12-2023/
Feb 22 23:57:05 <Fade>	apparently there was a big network outage in the united states today.
Feb 22 23:58:36 <cow_2001>	ugh i misnamed a guix build phase symbol and it didn't run my artisanal build phase ~_~
Feb 22 23:59:07 <cow_2001>	'patch-source-shebang instead of 'patch-source-shebangs
Feb 22 23:59:13 <cow_2001>	the second's the right one ~_~
Feb 23 01:35:33 <benoitj>	morning folks
Feb 23 01:38:38 <BigEatie>	Morning, benoitj 
Feb 23 01:38:57 <Fade>	heya, benoitj 
Feb 23 01:48:06 <benoitj>	hey Fade BigEatie 
Feb 23 01:49:39 <benoitj>	how is everyone
Feb 23 01:49:50 <benoitj>	seems calm, no SummerEmacs 
Feb 23 01:49:53 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 23 01:52:51 <BigEatie>	Lol, indeed
Feb 23 01:53:48 <BigEatie>	Just finished Mr. Robot. What a fantastic show.
Feb 23 01:54:04 <benoitj>	it's on my list. havent watched that yet
Feb 23 01:54:26 <BigEatie>	It's slow at times, but the payoff is worth it... would highly recommend it.
Feb 23 01:54:50 <BigEatie>	One thing you'll notice right off the bat is how much more accurate it is on the tech side than your typical hacking movies/shows
Feb 23 01:55:48 <BigEatie>	I generally appreciate that about a show -- liked that a lot about the Queen's Gambit too -- one of the best depictions of Chess I've seen
Feb 23 01:56:53 <cow_2001>	okay, i have a sort of working package definition
Feb 23 01:56:59 <cow_2001>	now i need to patch guile
Feb 23 01:57:28 <benoitj>	BigEatie: great. makes me want to start tonight :AP
Feb 23 01:57:29 <benoitj>	:P
Feb 23 01:57:31 <benoitj>	hi cow_2001 
Feb 23 01:58:28 *	Fade is just hacking
Feb 23 01:58:49 <Fade>	pretty quiet evening
Feb 23 01:59:50 <piethesailor>	Hi Fade!
Feb 23 02:00:16 <piethesailor>	Perfect timing. It usually is slow this late
Feb 23 02:00:28 <Fade>	heya piethesailor 
Feb 23 02:00:33 <cow_2001>	hihi
Feb 23 02:03:30 <mretka>	Hey Fade benoitj piethesailor cow_2001 
Feb 23 02:03:35 *	mretka is just drawing today
Feb 23 02:05:46 <cow_2001>	moo
Feb 23 02:10:27 <piethesailor>	About to hit the road. I'll be back on in 50m
Feb 23 02:16:13 <mretka>	BigEatie I watched only S1 of Mr. Robot, great show
Feb 23 02:24:19 *	mretka feels that reading AWS architecture diagrams is like using another language altogether at times
Feb 23 02:24:28 <benoitj>	hi mretka 
Feb 23 02:24:35 <mretka>	Hey benoitj :D
Feb 23 02:25:01 <mretka>	I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm decoding some sort of ancient Egyptian papyrus scroll reading these architecture diagrams
Feb 23 02:25:11 <benoitj>	mretka: i'm starting my aws architect cert the week after
Feb 23 02:25:31 <mretka>	Awesome benoitj! Are you going for the associate one? Or the professional one?
Feb 23 02:26:16 <benoitj>	this one is the associate
Feb 23 02:27:29 <benoitj>	it's a bit to see what it is, a bit to solidify many things I know already, and to help the group with more people with the paper
Feb 23 02:27:59 <mretka>	And this is the Rosetta Stone https://awsicons.dev/
Feb 23 02:28:18 <benoitj>	we'll see, the only certification I started, and never finished, is a security certificate in which I hacked 23 of their supposedly solutions to security issues
Feb 23 02:29:16 <benoitj>	we stopped sending people on that certification after I went
Feb 23 02:29:17 <mretka>	Awesome! Wishing you luck on the cert!
Feb 23 02:29:21 <mretka>	hahaha
Feb 23 02:29:27 *	mretka lets out a sensible chuckle
Feb 23 02:29:36 <mretka>	I wonder why :P
Feb 23 02:30:01 <mretka>	It's been a while since I did the Solutions Architect Associate exam
Feb 23 02:30:04 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 23 02:30:27 <mretka>	It's great to get a general view of AWS services and how to integrate them, and also learn about common architecture patterns
Feb 23 02:30:35 <benoitj>	mretka: in practice, I design, deploy, automate regularly, on gcp, aws, azure, rack space and many on-prem infra
Feb 23 02:30:56 <mretka>	Ohhh, this one is in the bag then
Feb 23 02:31:00 <mretka>	You use Terraform, right?
Feb 23 02:31:36 <benoitj>	terraform, I also used cloud formation to deploy a container app, with WAF, CDN and the whole thing, on a push of a button :P
Feb 23 02:32:07 <benoitj>	i've done some chef and ansible too, but not recently
Feb 23 02:32:48 <mretka>	I'm used to working directly with CloudFormation
Feb 23 02:33:31 <benoitj>	and I regularly integrate github enterprise, gitlab, azure devops, jenkins and I did once that aws CI crap, source something
Feb 23 02:33:55 <mretka>	You mean CodePipeline?
Feb 23 02:34:05 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 23 02:34:16 <benoitj>	that was couple of years ago
Feb 23 02:34:53 <benoitj>	that was on an app where I shrink the code from ~70k lines to 5k lines and it did the same thing :P
Feb 23 02:35:08 <benoitj>	but better
Feb 23 02:35:10 <mretka>	Oh wow, holy tree shaking, Batman! :P
Feb 23 02:35:10 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 23 02:35:22 <benoitj>	yeah, i'm the tree shaker :D
Feb 23 02:36:51 <mretka>	Nice! I'm the bug basher at work
Feb 23 02:37:15 <mretka>	Today I was mentoring a teammate on how to investigate bugs
Feb 23 02:37:23 <benoitj>	you know that you can tell how skilled someone is by using git stats tool? new devs, barely no commits, barely no lines produced, intermediate, small number of commits, large number of lines, experienced, large number of commits, a lot of lines added, even more lines removed
Feb 23 02:38:12 <benoitj>	nice, reading code and troubleshooting is a skill to learn
Feb 23 02:39:40 <mretka>	Interesting, this is my first time hearing about this git stats tool, is that from the CLI? Or is it platform specific?
Feb 23 02:39:59 <mretka>	Or is it this? https://github.com/IonicaBizau/git-stats
Feb 23 02:40:21 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 23 02:40:27 <benoitj>	I think so. let me check
Feb 23 02:41:18 <benoitj>	https://gitstats.sourceforge.net/
Feb 23 02:41:59 <benoitj>	I think theone you found is similar, and visual are nice
Feb 23 02:42:58 <mretka>	Yeah, I'm gonna test both, TIL
Feb 23 02:43:02 <mretka>	Thanks so much for sharing!
Feb 23 02:43:28 <benoitj>	https://gitstats.sourceforge.net/examples/git/
Feb 23 02:43:39 <benoitj>	example of stats for git itself
Feb 23 02:43:51 <benoitj>	I use the "authors" tab a lot
Feb 23 02:44:47 <benoitj>	for a regular team, everyone shows up on the list, so you can figure out if you need to coach around doing more commits, or having someone else to help them with their tasks
Feb 23 02:59:44 <benoitj>	mretka: I looked at the one you sent, it looks good, but it's just a console view github like activity chart
Feb 23 03:00:10 <benoitj>	quite different than the other git-stats
Feb 23 03:00:19 <mretka>	Yeah, they're quite different
Feb 23 03:00:25 <mretka>	I'm testing the git-stats you sent
Feb 23 03:01:39 <benoitj>	that one is interesting too: https://github.com/fouadh/gocan
Feb 23 03:01:57 <benoitj>	code-maat too, but I havent used it
Feb 23 03:03:10 <mretka>	This book referenced in the repo seems pretty interesting https://pragprog.com/titles/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene/
Feb 23 03:03:25 <mretka>	I would read it if I were more interested in the software development track
Feb 23 03:03:54 <mretka>	I'm slowly realizing that I'm transitioning to another role soon hehe
Feb 23 03:07:29 <mretka>	Now I'm gathering stats for the Emacs source repo
Feb 23 03:28:18 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 23 03:28:34 <benoitj>	which role if I may ask?
Feb 23 03:29:25 <benoitj>	you're more into ops, and cloud?
Feb 23 03:37:02 <mretka>	Yeah, I'm slowly migrating to ops and cloud
Feb 23 03:37:19 <mretka>	I wanna get into a management role later on in my career too
Feb 23 03:37:31 <benoitj>	cool
Feb 23 03:40:28 <benoitj>	there is a lot of needs in ops and cloud.
Feb 23 03:45:33 <mretka>	I gotta go for today, see you benoitj :D
Feb 23 03:52:01 <benoitj>	see you
Feb 23 05:58:11 <BigEatie>	mretka: It was a good show to finish
Feb 23 05:58:17 <BigEatie>	I throroughly enjoyed it
Feb 23 07:11:45 <fyrfaras>	Good morning everybunny :3
Feb 23 07:12:13 <fyrfaras>	BigEatie: Mr. Robot is a really cool series!
Feb 23 09:47:57 <glenneth>	Morning Folx o/
Feb 23 10:03:33 <nm0i>	mrnng glenneth 
Feb 23 10:21:52 <glenneth>	Hey nm0i How's things with you?
Feb 23 10:23:01 <nm0i>	i'm okay, procrastinating but okay, you?
Feb 23 10:23:30 <glenneth>	I'm doing OK.  Wishing for more hours in a day lol.
Feb 23 10:55:24 <trev>	glenneth: can you just carry some over from the day before?
Feb 23 11:03:30 <glenneth>	Hi trev I wish that were possible.  But I'm already in the negative from several days before :)
Feb 23 11:06:31 <nm0i>	Who needs sleep and health anyway?
Feb 23 11:08:55 <glenneth>	nm0i: You sound like my boss :D
Feb 23 11:09:50 <nm0i>	Something tells me he is not as sarcastic as I am...
Feb 23 11:20:49 <glenneth>	definitely not.  He means it lol
Feb 23 11:41:19 <glenneth>	Anyone here use the colemak layout?
Feb 23 11:57:33 <trev>	glenneth: no but looked into changing layouts and my head started spinning 
Feb 23 11:57:45 <trev>	colemak-dh or whatever 
Feb 23 12:35:00 <glenneth>	I'm using the hhkb and it has been suggested that switching to colemak may be better.  I suffer with carpal tunnel and get "frozen" shoulder during longer writing sessions.
Feb 23 12:39:51 <daviwil>	Hey folks! Thoughts on stream topics for today? I might try playing with the latest release of Guile Hoot, but not sure yet
Feb 23 12:44:16 <daviwil>	Maybe one on creating a minimal writing environment in Emacs

Feb 23 14:47:05 <teesh3rt>	btw daviwil: discord works!
Feb 23 14:47:16 <theesm>	always have to think of https://xkcd.com/1987/ regarding python
Feb 23 14:47:16 <nanounanue>	(as a Data Scientist that fight with python everyday I can testify)
Feb 23 14:47:25 <nanounanue>	Yup theesm
Feb 23 14:47:30 <nanounanue>	:)
Feb 23 14:47:35 <dthompson>	I packaged tons of stuff for guix back in the day, much less so these days, so I haven't really dealt with wheels in any serious manner
Feb 23 14:48:07 <teesh3rt>	oh my god i just saw that xkcd and yes relatable
Feb 23 14:48:14 <teesh3rt>	it feels like there are too many ways to install things in python
Feb 23 14:48:20 <dthompson>	I wrote the ruby build system for guix and found the same resistance to distros in the ruby community.  thankfully most of the issues were easy enough to work around.
Feb 23 14:48:21 <nanounanue>	I have settled a compromise: Use guix to set up an isolated shell, and then poetry on top
Feb 23 14:48:40 <nanounanue>	Not happy with that
Feb 23 14:48:53 <dthompson>	but I had the rubygems people tell me that test suites are only for developers
Feb 23 14:48:53 <nanounanue>	so, any workaround I am happy to listen
Feb 23 14:49:05 <teesh3rt>	for me there are way too many ways to install stuff in python: pip, venv, conda, poetry, tox, etc etc etc
Feb 23 14:49:06 <dthompson>	this was like 10 years ago
Feb 23 14:49:46 <dthompson>	language-specific package managers would be *fine* if they just wouldn't be so hostile to other ways of doing things

Feb 23 14:52:28 <dthompson>	like, you don't have to package your app for *any* distros if you just make it easy enough to build from source.
Feb 23 14:52:37 <teesh3rt>	theesm: "If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea." meanwhile the ways to install stuff:
Feb 23 14:52:59 *	dthompson steps off soapbox
Feb 23 14:56:27 <teesh3rt>	ok so i got discord working, i might try and set up exwm, it looks pretty nice
Feb 23 14:59:58 <talos>	Good day all
Feb 23 15:01:33 <nm0i>	talos the almewghty
Feb 23 15:03:45 <teesh3rt>	for some reason emacs dosent show up in gdm
Feb 23 15:03:53 <teesh3rt>	and yes i did do `guix install emacs-exwm`
Feb 23 15:04:38 <daviwil>	teesh3rt: You need to install it as a system package for it to show up there
Feb 23 15:04:46 <teesh3rt>	so sudo guix?
Feb 23 15:04:57 <daviwil>	as part of `guix system reconfigure`, in your system configuration file
Feb 23 15:05:51 <teesh3rt>	can i not just do "sudo guix"? i dont want to mess with files
Feb 23 15:05:59 <teesh3rt>	like `sudo guix install emacs-exwm`
Feb 23 15:08:50 <daviwil>	If you do that, it just gets installed as a package in the root user's profile
Feb 23 15:08:55 <daviwil>	Which is not what you want
Feb 23 15:09:08 <daviwil>	 the .desktop file only gets added at the system level if you add the package to the system configuraiton
Feb 23 15:09:23 <jakef>	he means the packages field of the operating-system definition
Feb 23 15:09:45 <jakef>	i think
Feb 23 15:09:47 <daviwil>	If he means that, then yes, you would need to use `sudo guix system reconfigure`
Feb 23 15:09:55 <daviwil>	but I'm guessing he really means `sudo guix install`
Feb 23 15:10:25 <daviwil>	it's better to get comfortable with the idea of editing a declarative configuration file for system and home configurations because all of the value of Guix is in those
Feb 23 15:10:33 <daviwil>	`guix install` is just a convenience command, I would not recommend using it
Feb 23 15:10:43 <jakef>	sorry david, you were the "he" i was referring to. i'll be quiet
Feb 23 15:10:46 <daviwil>	oh :)
Feb 23 15:10:58 <daviwil>	no need to be quiet, you are trying to help!
Feb 23 15:11:06 <daviwil>	I am reading messages on the go so I'm not absorbing all the details
Feb 23 15:11:13 <jakef>	all good :)
Feb 23 15:11:24 <teesh3rt>	oh i get it
Feb 23 15:11:34 <teesh3rt>	where is that one file yall are talking about?
Feb 23 15:11:40 <teesh3rt>	i know its a .scm file, i just forgot its location
Feb 23 15:11:45 <daviwil>	after installation I believe it's /etc/configuration.scm
Feb 23 15:11:53 <daviwil>	copy that to your home folder and make changes to it
Feb 23 15:12:09 <daviwil>	maybe it's not there actually
Feb 23 15:12:11 <teesh3rt>	its config.scm
Feb 23 15:12:43 <benoitj>	morning folks
Feb 23 15:12:45 <daviwil>	yep, you'll want to keep your own copy of that going forward because it's how you will apply changes to your config at the systme level
Feb 23 15:12:46 <daviwil>	hey benoitj
Feb 23 15:12:47 <benoitj>	hey daviwil 
Feb 23 15:12:50 <daviwil>	alright, AFK for a bit
Feb 23 15:13:15 <benoitj>	booting the day. need my coffee
Feb 23 15:15:03 <teesh3rt>	ok i copied it and changed it, what now?
Feb 23 15:15:08 <teesh3rt>	(im vvvv new to guix sorry)
Feb 23 15:16:11 <trev>	i've been using my bash script that feeds all xdg desktop files into fzf instead of rofi 
Feb 23 15:16:20 <trev>	dangit i was stuck on scrollback
Feb 23 15:16:43 <teesh3rt>	trev: hello welcome to the present
Feb 23 15:17:16 <trev>	😳
Feb 23 15:17:34 <nanounanue>	I also need cofee
Feb 23 15:18:53 <nanounanue>	Anyone is putting emacs as a shepherd service in her/his guix home config? If so, mind to share the code and maybe discuss the advantages of having in it or just using `(server-start)` in the `init` files?
Feb 23 15:23:59 <jakef>	teesh3rt: sudo guix system reconfigure config.scm
Feb 23 15:24:37 <jakef>	then reboot to ensure all changes take effect
Feb 23 15:27:29 <teesh3rt>	i feel like im doing something i shouldnt even though that is what im supposed to do
Feb 23 15:27:45 <teesh3rt>	that i think just tells you how new i am to these package managers where you edit files to install stuff
Feb 23 15:28:20 <jakef>	if you mess it up, there'
Feb 23 15:28:37 <teesh3rt>	yeah ik
Feb 23 15:28:38 <jakef>	s a good chance that reconfigure will throw an error for you
Feb 23 15:28:40 <teesh3rt>	1. there are generations
Feb 23 15:28:45 <teesh3rt>	2. it will throw a syntax error
Feb 23 15:29:10 <jakef>	live on the wild side a little
Feb 23 15:29:54 <teesh3rt>	question: does nix work in a similar way? where you edit files to do stuff?
Feb 23 15:30:41 <daviwil>	Yes, they are based on the same ideas
Feb 23 15:31:32 <teesh3rt>	its indexing objects right now, which i guess means it works
Feb 23 15:31:37 <teesh3rt>	it didnt give me an error yet
Feb 23 15:31:43 <benoitj>	teesh3rt: guix is a fork of nix ;)
Feb 23 15:31:57 <teesh3rt>	oh yeah now that i look at the names it makes sense
Feb 23 15:32:04 <teesh3rt>	guix sounds like "gnu + nix"
Feb 23 15:32:09 <jakef>	nix gets the credit for coming up with the idea, but i think using guile for config is an objective improvement?
Feb 23 15:32:57 <teesh3rt>	im guessing that is because guile (may???) be able to execute code
Feb 23 15:33:05 <benoitj>	yes, there are more. no non-free too
Feb 23 15:33:21 <teesh3rt>	(related to reconfigure) oh it works now! its downloading stuff!
Feb 23 15:36:37 <teesh3rt>	ok its applying a ton of grafts now
Feb 23 15:36:42 <teesh3rt>	it usually does that at the end
Feb 23 15:36:46 <teesh3rt>	so im guessing i did it right?
Feb 23 15:37:08 <jakef>	only one way to find out
Feb 23 15:39:37 <teesh3rt>	ok its done im gonna reboot
Feb 23 15:41:51 <teesh3rt>	hello from exwm!
Feb 23 15:42:04 <teesh3rt>	it works!
Feb 23 15:42:17 <jakef>	tremendous
Feb 23 15:47:33 <trev>	*crashes*
Feb 23 15:49:19 <teesh3rt>	so far it didnt actually!
Feb 23 15:49:23 <teesh3rt>	its actually working very much fine
Feb 23 15:49:32 <teesh3rt>	im doing some stuff now to actually make this a viable wm
Feb 23 15:49:37 <teesh3rt>	(aka a function to open stuff0
Feb 23 15:49:48 <teesh3rt>	s/0/\)
Feb 23 16:15:05 <theesm>	jakef: guile is definitely an improvement over nixlang (and in some regards over c++ what nix uses for some of its cli tooling where guix uses guile instead; shepherd uses guile as well, systemd what nix uses doesn’t use nixlang). Guix feels a lot more consistent because of this imho 
Feb 23 16:20:00 <trev>	i always forget there's no systemd on guix
Feb 23 16:23:42 <piethesailor>	Hola a todos! Feliz viernes!
Feb 23 16:25:24 <daviwil>	Hey piethesailor 
Feb 23 16:25:43 <theesm>	luckily there isn’t; I don’t say this from an anti-systemd standpoint (don’t think it’s a bad init system) but from a using guile to define services makes more sense to me & shepherd is more minimal which I like standpoint though 
Feb 23 16:28:41 <piethesailor>	Hi daviwil.
Feb 23 16:29:07 <piethesailor>	Guys.. I might have bricked my laptop 0_o
Feb 23 16:29:16 <piethesailor>	Running an ubuntu installation
Feb 23 16:29:51 <trev>	all laptops with ubuntu are bricks i think
Feb 23 16:29:59 <piethesailor>	lol
Feb 23 16:31:42 <piethesailor>	I think ubuntu is alright. Tried to reinstall and encrypt harddrive this time around. went through installer successfully, rebooted, removed intsall media and hit enter like the prompt said. Ive been on a black screen and a blinking "_" underscore since 9:30pm central yesterday
Feb 23 16:32:08 <piethesailor>	Im afraid to turn in off/reboot. 
Feb 23 16:37:19 <piethesailor>	Distrobox sounds cool though
Feb 23 16:38:07 <teesh3rt>	finally i got a viable system
Feb 23 16:46:37 <daviwil>	lol, the Alpine install I was going to use for the stream is hosed
Feb 23 16:46:48 <daviwil>	apparently I installed a grub update which makes the system unbootable
Feb 23 16:46:50 <piethesailor>	No!
Feb 23 16:47:16 <daviwil>	first Call of Duty reset my level to 1 and now this!
Feb 23 16:47:16 <piethesailor>	you and me both with hosed OS's
Feb 23 16:47:32 <piethesailor>	Thats a feature of call of duty tho
Feb 23 16:47:38 <piethesailor>	is it not?
Feb 23 16:47:49 <daviwil>	not when it happens to everyone in the game
Feb 23 16:47:55 <daviwil>	I think one of their game services must be malfunctioning
Feb 23 16:48:10 <daviwil>	lets see if I can get distrobox working in Guix
Feb 23 16:48:19 <daviwil>	in...  10 minutes
Feb 23 16:48:28 <piethesailor>	Good luck soldier
Feb 23 16:48:53 <piethesailor>	o7
Feb 23 16:49:12 <daviwil>	Press F to pay respects
Feb 23 16:49:19 <piethesailor>	F
Feb 23 16:51:38 <benoitj>	havent played cod for a long time. I recently (like 2 weeks ago) started playing dayz with my daughters. quite calm most of the time, and really stressfull sometimes
Feb 23 16:51:41 <Fade>	Good Morning
Feb 23 16:52:19 <benoitj>	hey Fade 
Feb 23 16:52:22 <piethesailor>	Morning Fade
Feb 23 16:52:29 <Fade>	fellas
Feb 23 16:52:46 <Fade>	is the stream happening today?
Feb 23 16:53:04 <teesh3rt>	daviwil: wait a minute about the grub update, just `guix package --roll-back`
Feb 23 16:53:06 <daviwil>	it will happen one way or another...  Distrobox may not be working though thanks to an Alpine issue
Feb 23 16:53:15 <daviwil>	teesh3rt: This is an Alpine linux box I'm dealing with
Feb 23 16:53:58 <teesh3rt>	o no
Feb 23 16:54:21 <piethesailor>	We can just use the time to talk Guile/Guix
Feb 23 16:54:21 <piethesailor>	lol
Feb 23 16:54:28 <piethesailor>	maybe dabble in some CL
Feb 23 16:54:34 <daviwil>	I may just have to fix it live, not a big deal
Feb 23 16:54:35 <piethesailor>	you know, for Fade and I
Feb 23 16:54:47 <daviwil>	I found a promising mailing list post
Feb 23 16:54:52 <Fade>	morganw is also a CL hacker
Feb 23 16:55:00 <daviwil>	oops, I mean fix Distrobox on guix
Feb 23 16:55:18 <Fade>	although it's daviwil's show, and he doesn't love CL. we have to accept that he's still a frood. :)
Feb 23 16:55:18 <piethesailor>	the more the merrier Fade
Feb 23 16:55:27 <daviwil>	what's a frood
Feb 23 16:55:34 <piethesailor>	fr
Feb 23 16:55:51 <Fade>	https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Frood
Feb 23 16:56:08 <daviwil>	ahhh, of course
Feb 23 16:56:34 <piethesailor>	I don't descriminate lisps. I like them all. There are just a number of solid packages in CL that accomodate my needs, scheme isnt quite there 
Feb 23 16:56:54 <morganw>	Fade: I think I would only pass as a CL dabbler
Feb 23 16:56:58 <piethesailor>	I own all the Little Schemer books, they are really great
Feb 23 16:57:15 <teesh3rt>	is there a function to pick a random item from a list in elisp?
Feb 23 16:57:19 <alternateved>	Little Schemer books are nice
Feb 23 16:57:26 <piethesailor>	little scheme, the reasoned schemer, the little learner, etc..
Feb 23 16:57:49 <piethesailor>	(nth (random 0 10000) *list*)
Feb 23 16:57:53 <piethesailor>	maybe?
Feb 23 16:58:05 <piethesailor>	or rather
Feb 23 16:58:07 <alternateved>	daviwil: ah, the famous grub update
Feb 23 16:58:16 <daviwil>	yeah it got me
Feb 23 16:58:25 <piethesailor>	(nth (random o (length *list*) *list*))
Feb 23 16:58:29 <daviwil>	I had to turn on edge for Hyprland and I got bit
Feb 23 16:58:43 <alternateved>	Didn't they fix it lately?
Feb 23 16:58:53 <daviwil>	no idea, I may have pulled before the fix went out
Feb 23 16:59:21 <teesh3rt>	piethesailor: thank you!
Feb 23 16:59:45 <alternateved>	https://fosstodon.org/@alpinelinux/111959820210366133
Feb 23 16:59:48 <morganw>	I got the Little Schemer book and tried Guile, but came out preferring Common Lisp. (Although possibly because I liked the Common Lisp book that I read more and I've never felt like I knew what I was doing in Geiser)
Feb 23 17:00:07 <trev>	make it a grub stream, but not the bootloader, just you chowing down on some grub
Feb 23 17:00:30 <piethesailor>	Sorry its this teeth3rt (nth (random (length *list*)) *list*)
Feb 23 17:00:47 <morganw>	And doubly uncomfortable trying to manage Guix in Geiser.
Feb 23 17:01:04 <Fade>	teesh3rt: https://0x0.st/H5Jt.txt
Feb 23 17:01:38 <alternateved>	morganw: Which CL book?
Feb 23 17:01:41 <alternateved>	Practical CL?
Feb 23 17:02:02 <piethesailor>	The one think I love about cl over schemes is the repl experience. If there was a marriage of all that is sly and guile, + the package I need(lol) I'd be super happy
Feb 23 17:02:16 <Fade>	in elisp there's a builtin: seq-random-elt
Feb 23 17:02:29 <Fade>	defined in seq.el
Feb 23 17:02:53 <morganw>	alternateved: I bought the new version of "A Gentle Introduction
Feb 23 17:02:53 <morganw>	to Symbolic Computation" https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/book.pdf
Feb 23 17:03:15 <piethesailor>	Oh yeah teesh3rt. Fade suggestion is much cleaner
Feb 23 17:03:26 <piethesailor>	probably a faster implementation of the idea also
Feb 23 17:03:31 <Fade>	anyhow it's a trivial function.
Feb 23 17:03:54 <piethesailor>	sure
Feb 23 17:03:56 <daviwil>	stream chat booting up in #systemcrafters-live
Feb 23 17:04:04 <piethesailor>	heading over
Feb 23 17:05:55 <Fade>	scheme hangs me up on lisp-1 issues
Feb 23 17:06:05 <Fade>	my brain is fully steeped in lisp-2-ness
Feb 23 17:06:37 <Fade>	still, if it couldn't be CL I'd accept scheme as a second choice.
Feb 23 17:06:52 <Fade>	I like racket
Feb 23 17:09:18 <teesh3rt>	Fade: thanks! it works!
Feb 23 17:11:34 <daniel42>	is it  easy  to learn new things  from little books style?
Feb 23 17:19:36 <Fade>	victory!
Feb 23 17:22:32 <drishal>	yoo 
Feb 23 17:45:51 <Fade>	o/
Feb 23 17:50:56 <fyrfaras>	daniel42: toki~ I will answer you later since I'm reading the little schemer ATM. We are attending critical mass soon :3
Feb 23 18:39:28 <benoitj>	hey shom2 
Feb 23 18:39:36 <shom2>	I cannot get irc to give me my nick "shom" even when I'm logged in and authenticated. Unfortunately I spend most of my time fighting irc the rare times I have time to come hang out!
Feb 23 18:39:36 <benoitj>	are you the real shom?
Feb 23 18:39:45 <shom2>	I am 😭
Feb 23 18:40:13 <benoitj>	shom2: might want to ask libera folks about it
Feb 23 18:41:06 <benoitj>	nix flakes, you want to use that for your system and home configuration right?
Feb 23 18:41:17 <shom2>	Thanks @benoitj. I've been using web clients. I just need to get a permanent setup on desktop and mobile.
Feb 23 18:41:24 <shom2>	Yes I do!
Feb 23 18:41:33 <benoitj>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoB0pHZ0fpI
Feb 23 18:42:00 <benoitj>	that goes through the process, from using the generated files from the nix installer, to converting that config to a nix flake
Feb 23 18:42:21 <benoitj>	https://git.sr.ht/~benoit/dotfiles
Feb 23 18:42:48 <benoitj>	that is my config. just pay attention to the "milhouse" system configuration in the flake. the other systems are not yet migrated to my new modules
Feb 23 18:43:01 <shom2>	I want to just jump straight to flakes deep end! I enjoy docker-compose a lot and want to make everything declarative. Ansible has been good but configuring it isn't automated yet.
Feb 23 18:43:30 <trev>	shom2: did you try to GHOST it with /nickserv GHOST shom [password] ?
Feb 23 18:43:43 <shom2>	Awesome, thanks! I should be doing my guile homework but I might be tempted with this 😬
Feb 23 18:47:21 <shom2>	trev I did ghost and it said shom has been ghosted and then I identified and then did /nick
Feb 23 18:47:32 <shom2>	Hahaha now it says this
Feb 23 18:47:51 <benoitj>	shom2: in a nutshell, you use the installer to install nix, this generates /etc/nixos/configuration.nix and hardware-configuration.nix, you copy this in a folder in your home, git init, flake init, add a nixosconfiguration that loads the configuration.nix, add everything to git (flakes requires that), nixos-rebuild swich --flake .#
Feb 23 18:47:54 <shom2>	NickServ 11:46:13
Feb 23 18:47:54 <shom2>	[NOTICE] You are already logged in as shom.
Feb 23 18:47:55 <shom2>	⚠ The nickname 'shom2' is already in use!
Feb 23 18:48:22 <benoitj>	oh, there is "account" and nicknames
Feb 23 18:48:40 <benoitj>	you seems to have registered the account shom, but use the nickname shom2 :P
Feb 23 18:48:53 <shom2>	😂 I'm not trying to be Shom2, doing /nick shom says that shom2 is already in use 🤦🏽‍♂️
Feb 23 18:50:04 <benoitj>	"regain" command?
Feb 23 18:51:15 <benoitj>	otherwise, it could be /msg nickserv group when using "shom"
Feb 23 18:51:21 <shom>	Yay!!! Regain did it. Ghost + regain! Thanks benoitj and trev
Feb 23 18:51:24 <benoitj>	shom: looks like it worked
Feb 23 18:51:40 <trev>	nice!
Feb 23 18:51:51 <trev>	it's SHOM time!!!! - your new slogan
Feb 23 18:53:22 <benoitj>	now it's the real and only shom!
Feb 23 18:54:03 <shom>	Hahahaha Shom is my real name and so many of my friends type SHOM and say SHOM when greeting me!
Feb 23 18:55:01 <shom>	@benoitj thanks for the Nix startup info. I feel I'm going to fall into that rabbit hole. Why did I learn guile in the beginner course 😂
Feb 23 18:55:16 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 23 18:55:43 <benoitj>	there are couple of us here using nix. talos, myself, there is another one too that I forget
Feb 23 18:59:35 <shom>	You guys need some nix representation on the forum. I don't like monocultures!
Feb 23 18:59:37 <benoitj>	just pass buy when you get in trouble
Feb 23 19:00:12 <benoitj>	yes, I just need to follow-up with david. we were making a list of possible categories and tags, but never implemented it
Feb 23 19:00:32 <benoitj>	like os category, but #guix or #nix tags
Feb 23 19:00:47 <benoitj>	we were about to test something, but both got busy
Feb 23 19:03:11 <shom>	Yeah tags are really nice, I've been embracing tags more than hierarchical structures in more things and making tags hierarchical instead like
Feb 23 19:05:44 <benoitj>	yeah, tags are nice
Feb 23 19:09:19 <shom>	M-x shom time! (also known as lunch!)
Feb 23 19:09:30 <benoitj>	(time 'shom)
Feb 23 19:09:38 <shom>	😂
Feb 23 19:33:46 <Fade>	hail victorious hacker.
Feb 23 19:52:01 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 23 20:16:45 <BigEatie>	daviwil: did you write systemcrafters.cc css from scratch, or are you using some kind of framework?
Feb 23 20:17:13 <daviwil>	BigEatie: scratch! 
Feb 23 20:27:31 <BigEatie>	Nice, thinking about trying to make a website myself, I know nothing about it though and wasn't sure which route to go. Definitely thinking about using org-publish, but how did you get it themed up -- the number of classes the exporter outputs seems pretty minimal?
Feb 23 20:27:56 <BigEatie>	Maybe I should just go hugo, seems easier, but somehow your way also seems more rewarding, if for no other reason I learn something.
Feb 23 20:40:28 <shom>	BigEatie: You could check out PicoCSS, it uses html semantic syntax and is quite minimal. If you wanted an out of box solution that wasn't a whole framework, but scratch is also fun! 
Feb 23 20:40:28 <shom>	https://picocss.com/
Feb 23 20:41:51 <daviwil>	BigEatie: I export my own page layout by overriding what Org doe
Feb 23 20:41:54 <daviwil>	Err
Feb 23 20:42:03 <daviwil>	Overriding what ox-html does by default 
Feb 23 20:42:14 <daviwil>	So I'm just styling my own elements 
Feb 23 20:43:11 <BigEatie>	Ahh, gotcha, sounds involved
Feb 23 20:43:23 <BigEatie>	Thanks shom, it looks pretty cool, might give that a try
Feb 23 20:49:30 <daviwil>	BigEatie: its not that bad really, everything I do can be seen in this file: https://codeberg.org/SystemCrafters/systemcrafters-site/src/branch/master/publish.el
Feb 23 20:55:14 <trev>	daviwil: did you eat the grilled meats?

Feb 23 21:29:49 *	Topic for #systemcrafters is: System Crafters General Chat · "where the craven veterans of the net wars shuffle around muttering about ancient RISC hardware while the pretty young things hob knob with the hoi poloi." · https://systemcrafters.net · https://forum.systemcrafters.net
Feb 23 21:29:49 *	Topic for #systemcrafters set by benoitj!a1f51ac63d@user/benoitj (Sat Feb  3 17:13:05 2024)
Feb 23 21:50:52 <Fade>	grilled meats are just for eating
Feb 23 21:53:04 *	BigEatie wonders what other meats are for
Feb 23 21:55:11 <Fade>	I have about three pounds of meat dedicated to thinking
Feb 23 22:05:06 <BigEatie>	Lmao...and once again I'm reminded of the short story....They're made out of meat...
Feb 23 22:18:45 <Fade>	an excellent story
Feb 23 22:30:07 *	benoitj is rofl after finally getting what that 3 pounds of meat was
Feb 23 22:30:41 <Fade>	:D
Feb 23 22:32:59 <sahil_>	Hi, has anyone of you tried thunderbird? It's so cool. I just found out that I can have my IRC, and mail all in a simple and quick to setup interface. :) Except emacs ofcourse.
Feb 23 22:33:20 <Fade>	i use thunderbird for email
Feb 23 22:33:44 <Fade>	before firefox, mozilla was a merged client for web, mail, and news. i didn't know it supported irc.
Feb 23 22:34:00 <sahil_>	Fade: try the chat section as well. It's cool
Feb 23 22:34:43 <sahil_>	all Irc matrix xmpp and another one
Feb 23 22:34:58 <Fade>	huh
Feb 23 22:38:32 <benoitj>	thurderbird?
Feb 23 22:39:59 <benoitj>	Fade: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/instant-messaging-and-chat
Feb 23 22:40:18 <benoitj>	looks like they are still updating that sssoftware
Feb 23 22:40:28 <sahil_>	benoitj: Yes
Feb 23 22:40:50 <benoitj>	glad you're excited about it :)
Feb 23 22:41:19 <benoitj>	I probably was not gandalf the white when I last used thunderbird
Feb 23 22:41:40 <sahil_>	It's simple, quick to setup, and get working, no-strings-attached, that's why I am excited.
Feb 23 22:42:51 <benoitj>	great
Feb 23 22:43:24 <benoitj>	not my cup of coffee, but what ever works for you :)
Feb 23 22:44:35 <benoitj>	I just can't leave emacs. emacs is my home.
Feb 23 22:44:52 <Fade>	i'm quite in favour of weird features in software I otherwise know well. :)
Feb 23 22:45:13 <benoitj>	like doom in excel?
Feb 23 22:45:18 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 23 22:45:41 <Fade>	like a 6502 implementation in minecraft
Feb 23 22:45:48 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 23 22:46:13 <Fade>	all the non-editing software in emacs
Feb 23 22:46:33 <benoitj>	maleable systems
Feb 23 22:47:07 <benoitj>	they tend to enable this weird stuff
Feb 23 22:47:20 <Fade>	yep
Feb 23 22:47:51 <benoitj>	I never thought I would learn something about thunderbird today :P
Feb 23 22:47:55 <Fade>	like 98.7% of the stuff we do with unix
Feb 23 22:48:01 <benoitj>	https://malleable.systems/
Feb 23 22:48:02 <Fade>	way outside the original spec. ;)
Feb 23 22:48:07 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 23 22:48:17 <benoitj>	not really
Feb 23 22:48:18 <Fade>	is it a server? a workstation? a firewall?
Feb 23 22:48:50 <benoitj>	it's architected for the future uses in mind. open, only the right level of decisions made, the rest open to bend at your will
Feb 23 22:51:00 <sahil_>	Hi, I just disconnected :|. I had a question benoitj
Feb 23 22:51:12 <benoitj>	no worries
Feb 23 22:52:03 <benoitj>	what happened?
Feb 23 22:52:07 <sahil_>	I was looking for a powerfull editor and /or IDE for C++, and vim and emacs don't have enough horsepower yet to satisfy me. I was wondering 
Feb 23 22:52:52 <benoitj>	if emacs and vim dont have enough hoursepower...
Feb 23 22:53:01 <sahil_>	wouldn't it be the best text editor (it being one that we would create), which is as extensible as emacs (everything is a buffer), and as fast as vim.
Feb 23 22:53:05 <Fade>	I find that statement surprising in several ways.
Feb 23 22:53:31 <benoitj>	sahil_: to be honest, vim is fast because it does not do much
Feb 23 22:53:50 <sahil_>	benoitj: Yes and that's it's shortcomming
Feb 23 22:54:01 <Fade>	okay, I'm going to have a glass of wine. back later
Feb 23 22:54:04 <benoitj>	emacs, well, it runs an editor, an email reader, an irc client
Feb 23 22:54:10 <benoitj>	Fade: I probably need one early
Feb 23 22:54:26 <Fade>	it's been that kind of day. :)
Feb 23 22:54:31 <benoitj>	sahil_: what do you have in mind?
Feb 23 22:54:41 <sahil_>	A multi-threaded gpu accelerated version of emacs (maybe a rewrite in C++)
Feb 23 22:54:49 <Fade>	LOL
Feb 23 22:54:58 <Fade>	okay, I can't engage this conversation
Feb 23 22:55:08 *	Fade disappears in a puff of logic
Feb 23 22:55:16 <benoitj>	haha
Feb 23 22:55:19 <sahil_>	Fade: Fadeaway then :) (jokin)
Feb 23 22:55:32 <benoitj>	one could do that with cuda
Feb 23 22:55:51 <benoitj>	you could run your editor on a mining rig 
Feb 23 22:56:14 <sahil_>	benoitj: not editor
Feb 23 22:56:28 <sahil_>	More like a homogeneous state machine (fast ofcourse)
Feb 23 22:56:35 <morganw>	sahil_: I can imagine that the more IDE-like a product becomes the harder it would be to customize and extend, so to have the best of both worlds you might end up using two programs.  e.g. use Vim and then a deluxe IDE that can use Vim key bindings.
Feb 23 22:57:08 <sahil_>	morganw: That's what I am arguing against.
Feb 23 22:57:52 <sahil_>	Emacs can have multiple layouts. A minimal one, one with a tree and 10 different windows anywhere, on different monitors etc, all managed by emacs.
Feb 23 22:58:50 <sahil_>	So It's not about it being ide like or not. It's more about speed and (emacslikeness, the extensibility), where everything is a buffer, and different layouts exploit that fact differently.
Feb 23 22:59:31 <sahil_>	It hurts when I scroll with 2-3 inline images, and it starts to lag.
Feb 23 23:01:46 <morganw>	I think some people have bad results when "pixel scrolling" is enabled, as in they made the scrolling smooth but everything becomes very slow, so you might want to check which scrolling modes you are using.
Feb 23 23:02:29 <morganw>	But I don't think there are really any equivalents to Emacs in terms of the design and extensiblity, it is more like running an additional computer than running a program.
Feb 23 23:02:55 <sahil_>	morganw: But one can be made right?
Feb 23 23:02:55 <benoitj>	sahil_: just use lsp and emacs and it's all good. no need to rewrite
Feb 23 23:03:39 <sahil_>	maybe I am speaking from my inexperience.
Feb 23 23:03:58 <sahil_>	Making this argument 4-5 years in future would make more sense
Feb 23 23:04:19 <morganw>	sahil_: People have tried a few times and generally they don't make anything as functional.  I could try Lem, but most of the features which I would class as "extensiblity" are missing.
Feb 23 23:05:00 <morganw>	I think Emacs is 40+ years old so it is asking a lot to make a complete replacement.
Feb 23 23:05:31 <morganw>	*You could try
Feb 23 23:05:51 <sahil_>	morganw: but now foss community is also larger then ever. And it has to be done someday, I believe. 
Feb 23 23:07:14 <sahil_>	take the zed editor for example. In such a short amount of time, just create enough hype, and you got an ecosystem. It's possible for emacs as well.
Feb 23 23:09:32 <fyrfaras>	sahil_: Maybe you could take a look at this?
Feb 23 23:09:35 <fyrfaras>	https://gtoolkit.com/
Feb 23 23:10:23 <fyrfaras>	But I'm not sure if C++ programming would be sufficient in it.
Feb 23 23:11:29 <fyrfaras>	I'm more into interactive programming at the moment :3
Feb 23 23:11:49 <morganw>	sahil_: If you started with a distribution like Doom, it might be best to check whether you have the same performance issues on just plain Emacs.  I've never tried Doom, but I can imagine some of the opinionated settings may favour trying to mimic other programs at the expense of performance.
Feb 23 23:12:02 <fyrfaras>	I need to sleep now. Nini~ everybunny!
Feb 23 23:12:11 <morganw>	fyrfaras: Good night!
Feb 23 23:12:35 <sahil_>	Bye!

Feb 23 23:40:17 *	BigEatie +1s "I just can't leave emacs. emacs is my home."
Feb 23 23:44:36 <BigEatie>	In what ways do you guys find Emacs to be slow? I use it for basically everything, I've never seen it noticeably lagging compared to other editors.
Feb 23 23:45:02 <BigEatie>	MY HOME HAS BEEN INSULTED AND I MUST DEFEND ITS HONOR
Feb 23 23:57:06 <cow_2001>	it often halts completely while things are computing
Feb 23 23:58:18 <cow_2001>	ement.el and the mastodon't client are like that
Feb 24 00:03:47 <cow_2001>	it's just a piece of software.  reasonable criticism is fine
Feb 24 00:13:08 <BigEatie>	Oh, the multithreading issue, yea, that'a fair
Feb 24 00:15:52 <cow_2001>	if i were The Emperor of The Cosmos, i'd put getting better multithreading and subprocessing and all that kind of stuff into GNU Emacs on top priority
Feb 24 00:17:44 <BigEatie>	Plot twist: the cosmos runs on a single thread
Feb 24 00:17:51 <BigEatie>	That's the source of all that quantum weirdness
Feb 24 00:44:34 <benoitj>	BigEatie: dont worry, it sounded almost like a troll
Feb 24 00:45:20 <benoitj>	I mean, Fade ran away, and I kept playing
Feb 24 00:46:21 <benoitj>	but honestly, we would like better concurency / parallelism behavior in emacs. that does not mean I would change emacs to something else inferior
Feb 24 00:49:44 <benoitj>	just discovered my terminal spotify player has support for cover, if I enable them

Feb 24 00:57:00 <BigEatie>	Nice, and also lmao at the shirt
Feb 24 00:57:01 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 24 00:57:04 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 24 00:57:12 <benoitj>	I like mc lars
Feb 24 00:57:31 <benoitj>	this one is "do the bruce campbell"

Feb 24 01:45:39 <benoitj>	talos: oh yeah
Feb 24 01:47:00 <Motaik>	hey guys
Feb 24 01:47:07 <Motaik>	what's up
Feb 24 01:47:08 <benoitj>	BigEatie: lars attack is not bad too
Feb 24 01:47:11 <benoitj>	hi Motaik 
Feb 24 01:47:21 <Motaik>	hello @benoitj
Feb 24 01:47:52 <Motaik>	what yall been up to?
Feb 24 01:48:08 <benoitj>	tonight's been calm. playing some dayz
Feb 24 01:48:21 <benoitj>	about you?
Feb 24 01:48:25 <Motaik>	dayz days. long time no see
Feb 24 01:48:27 <talos>	Thinking of making a archivable and stuff site built on git
Feb 24 01:48:50 <Motaik>	holy cow. its time @talos
Feb 24 01:49:04 <Motaik>	i'm configuring exwm right now
Feb 24 01:49:09 <benoitj>	nice
Feb 24 01:49:13 <talos>	Cool!
Feb 24 01:49:21 <Motaik>	having some troubles with ytb videos on guix
Feb 24 01:49:51 <talos>	I use NixOS but used Guix in the past
Feb 24 01:50:00 <talos>	Maybe I could help, dunno
Feb 24 01:50:35 <benoitj>	which browser is the question
Feb 24 01:50:56 <benoitj>	any browser in guix may have problem
Feb 24 01:51:01 <benoitj>	like the default ones
Feb 24 01:51:28 <Motaik>	yeah, been trying with a few
Feb 24 01:51:34 <Motaik>	but all have some issues
Feb 24 01:51:45 <talos>	Since this channel isn't #guix, I'll say that when I used Guix, I cheated and used Flatpak to get Firefox lol
Feb 24 01:51:57 <Motaik>	hehehe
Feb 24 01:52:04 <Motaik>	im considering it
Feb 24 01:52:13 <benoitj>	on guix, I only used nonguix firefox, and chrome and qutebrowser from nix
Feb 24 01:52:41 <benoitj>	if I recall, the default browsers also add bunch of plugins that break yt and similar sites, need to turn them off
Feb 24 01:53:12 <talos>	Ungoogled Chromium seemed to work with Youtube okay-ish
Feb 24 01:53:29 <Motaik>	i tried icecat, and althought i'm able to play ytb, It is inconsistent 
Feb 24 01:53:36 <Motaik>	some videos work. some dont
Feb 24 01:53:54 <talos>	Probably some codecs are missing
Feb 24 01:54:10 <Motaik>	also, a lot of pages even like github ones dont get displayed correctly
Feb 24 01:54:25 <Motaik>	yeah. been trying to figure which ones if so
Feb 24 01:54:50 <Motaik>	i'm trying vimb right now. But ytb can't play nothing
Feb 24 01:55:15 <Motaik>	saw on the internet that maybe for vimb, it needs GStream lib
Feb 24 01:55:18 <talos>	Yeah, dunno what to do about Github, other than disable stuff like benoitj suggests
Feb 24 01:55:36 <Motaik>	but guix apparently doesnt have gstream
Feb 24 01:55:46 <talos>	Ooh I see
Feb 24 01:56:14 <Motaik>	probably i'll stick with it, and disbale some stuff
Feb 24 01:56:37 <Motaik>	or just go mayhem like @talos and use firefox hehe
Feb 24 01:56:53 <talos>	The only solution I can see other than disabling stuff is to use either Flatpak or enable the Nix system service like benoitj lol
Feb 24 01:57:07 <benoitj>	nonguix works too
Feb 24 01:57:16 <talos>	Oh yeah
Feb 24 01:57:18 <benoitj>	I used firefox from nonguix
Feb 24 01:58:05 <Motaik>	do you guys use firefox as well? I was wondering if exwm can handle multiple tabs like with vimb too
Feb 24 01:59:01 <talos>	I use Firefox practically 99% of the time haha
Feb 24 02:00:07 <Motaik>	fair enough hahah
Feb 24 02:00:25 <Motaik>	perhaps it is the way to go!
Feb 24 02:00:39 <Motaik>	one comment just off topic
Feb 24 02:00:42 <talos>	Mainly for the noscript and ublock origin
Feb 24 02:00:55 <Motaik>	tanking in irc chats is cool!
Feb 24 02:01:00 <Motaik>	talking*
Feb 24 02:01:11 <talos>	I agree!
Feb 24 02:01:34 <Motaik>	@talos thats cool!
Feb 24 02:01:49 <Motaik>	how you guys mark someone here?
Feb 24 02:02:40 <talos>	Mark? As in highlight?
Feb 24 02:02:44 <Motaik>	like, when repling to one person speciffically
Feb 24 02:03:17 <talos>	Oh, in my IRC client I just alt-tab when typing their name
Feb 24 02:03:20 <benoitj>	Motaik: I use qutebrowser from nix, it supports even netflix
Feb 24 02:03:38 <benoitj>	widevine drm
Feb 24 02:03:43 <talos>	Err, just ab
Feb 24 02:03:46 <talos>	*Tab
Feb 24 02:03:50 <Motaik>	sorry, my english is off sometimes
Feb 24 02:03:52 <talos>	No alt required haha
Feb 24 02:03:56 <talos>	It's fine!
Feb 24 02:04:32 <Motaik>	hmm . let me try talos 
Feb 24 02:04:42 <talos>	That worked
Feb 24 02:05:36 <Motaik>	 colol
Feb 24 02:05:38 <Motaik>	cool
Feb 24 02:06:02 <Motaik>	!
Feb 24 02:06:24 <talos>	BRB
Feb 24 02:07:37 <Motaik>	benoitj: i don't have nix configured yet. is it available in nonguix channel?
Feb 24 02:07:50 <benoitj>	nix-service-type, it's core guix :)
Feb 24 02:08:22 <benoitj>	https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Miscellaneous-Services.html
Feb 24 02:09:29 <benoitj>	it's a bit of a race, found a huge military crate, need to bring it 1 meter a second to my base
Feb 24 02:09:43 <benoitj>	and the night is about to come
Feb 24 02:10:09 <Motaik>	benoitj: i'll try it out!
Feb 24 02:10:20 <Motaik>	holly! you can do it!
Feb 24 02:10:21 <benoitj>	works well
Feb 24 02:10:36 <benoitj>	700m from my base
Feb 24 02:10:48 <benoitj>	at least no one sawme
Feb 24 02:11:06 <Motaik>	you got this!
Feb 24 02:11:11 <Motaik>	go my man
Feb 24 02:11:19 <benoitj>	hehe
Feb 24 02:11:54 <Motaik>	and he is the champ!
Feb 24 02:12:44 <benoitj>	i'm actually just a noob, started couple of weeks ago
Feb 24 02:13:06 <benoitj>	takes time to understand all the mecanism and last more than 1 hour before dying
Feb 24 02:14:35 <benoitj>	talos: did you see you can run guix in a flake now?
Feb 24 02:14:57 <benoitj>	talos: https://github.com/mmai/guix-flake
Feb 24 02:15:03 <Motaik>	yeah. I didn't got much further hehe. One i was playing these days is lethal company
Feb 24 02:15:13 <Motaik>	it is so much fun! hahah
Feb 24 02:15:42 <Motaik>	actually i didn't! i never tried nix 
Feb 24 02:16:08 <Motaik>	what is flakes anyway?
Feb 24 02:17:54 <benoitj>	it's similar to guix, actually guix is using a fork of nix build server, I think now it may have diverged, but it's still c code. guix has a really nice language, better developer features with the repl and lisp. nix has a weird language, but still functional (as in FP) and lazy loaded, it has way more packages, and support a real linux kernel, and all the software I need to work
Feb 24 02:18:12 <benoitj>	they are quite similar and different at the same time
Feb 24 02:18:26 <benoitj>	I like both, but I use nix because it gets out of the way
Feb 24 02:19:37 <Motaik>	hmm i see. I was using void on my other machine, and installed the nix package manager
Feb 24 02:19:42 <Motaik>	it is really great
Feb 24 02:19:54 <benoitj>	nix flakes are ever better :D
Feb 24 02:20:13 <Motaik>	nix flakes are like containarized envs?
Feb 24 02:20:15 <benoitj>	makes your system really reproducible, unlike guix, which needs weird hacks to achieve a bit of it
Feb 24 02:20:19 <benoitj>	no
Feb 24 02:20:47 <Motaik>	hmmm. How so?
Feb 24 02:21:29 <Motaik>	i tought guix reproductability was  one of its main features
Feb 24 02:22:02 <Motaik>	my man. I'm having some screen pproblems in this laptop, jesus
Feb 24 02:22:03 <benoitj>	with flakes, you dont have channels anymore, anything out of you git is bad, real bad, and a flake has inputs (nixpkgs, and a lot more), and outputs (a nixosConfiguration for example). it also has to concept of lock file, like npm, so all the versions of all the inputs, and the inputs of inputs are locked, so you can clone that old 2 years old config, and it will still work. for guix, it does not (I know I switch between both every 
Feb 24 02:22:03 <benoitj>	year)
Feb 24 02:23:04 <Motaik>	wow! that neat!
Feb 24 02:23:38 <benoitj>	guix does not have that, you need a channel file in ~/.config/guix/channels.scm and it creates a checkout at a specific version in ~/.cache/guix, so these two things are invisible in you git repo, you can store some of it, but it does not work well when you have more than just guix and non-guix channels (I have 4-5 guix channels in my channels.scm)
Feb 24 02:23:48 <Motaik>	it is one thing i'll like to try. that is, nix and its crazy features
Feb 24 02:25:23 <Motaik>	so, nix enables multiple git repos in one? 
Feb 24 02:25:26 <benoitj>	with nix for example, my fork of dwm is a flake on it's own, and my nixos configuration has my dwm flake as input. works all the time
Feb 24 02:25:29 <benoitj>	no
Feb 24 02:25:44 <benoitj>	it enables tracking your "channels" dependencies with their specific versions
Feb 24 02:25:48 <benoitj>	let me show you, simpler
Feb 24 02:25:52 <Motaik>	hmmm
Feb 24 02:25:54 <Motaik>	okay
Feb 24 02:26:03 <benoitj>	https://git.sr.ht/~benoit/dotfiles/tree/main/item/flake.nix
Feb 24 02:26:13 <benoitj>	https://git.sr.ht/~benoit/dotfiles/tree/main/item/flake.lock
Feb 24 02:26:36 <Motaik>	srry for the lack of knowledge in this matter 
Feb 24 02:26:38 <benoitj>	so, to setup any "new" nix config, I just clone my repo, and switch to it. it will work
Feb 24 02:27:19 <benoitj>	if you see "inputs" these are the equivalent of channels.scm, but it's there, in my config. and the lock file has the specific version of each channels
Feb 24 02:27:38 <benoitj>	so in 10 years, this will still work
Feb 24 02:27:56 <Motaik>	ahhhh
Feb 24 02:27:58 <Motaik>	now i see
Feb 24 02:28:15 <benoitj>	with guix, unless you know tricks, everytime guix update, it has the potential to break your config, so if it sits for a year, it will most likely fail
Feb 24 02:28:57 <benoitj>	for example, during my guix -> nix transition, I had a working guix system, used nix for 1 year, then used my guix config again, and it broke. a software was no longer building in latest nix
Feb 24 02:29:03 <benoitj>	*** err latest guix
Feb 24 02:29:21 <benoitj>	with nix flakes, you dont have that unless you update the flake
Feb 24 02:30:09 <Motaik>	but, even with the generations config for guix, it still updates the config, lets say if you stored that in a separated repo?
Feb 24 02:30:29 <benoitj>	the channels and their version is not stored in your git repo
Feb 24 02:30:40 <benoitj>	the version of nix is hidden in ~/.cache/guix
Feb 24 02:30:47 <benoitj>	it's the actual git clone of the repo
Feb 24 02:31:50 <benoitj>	you can store it using guix describe > channels.scm.lock, and -C channels.scm.lock when guix system switch and so on, but it does not fully work. I keep having issues where code in my own channel does not see the code from nonguix
Feb 24 02:32:09 <benoitj>	plus, you need couple of custom commands to get that to work
Feb 24 02:33:00 <Motaik>	so it demands multiple steps to reproduce something that nix does by default
Feb 24 02:33:10 <Motaik>	sounds like i need to try nix soon
Feb 24 02:33:24 <benoitj>	yes, and you cant reproduced  locking dependencies of your dependencies
Feb 24 02:33:38 <benoitj>	at least not without code
Feb 24 02:34:07 <benoitj>	I havent really looked at it, but it's something that nix users are always missing when going on guix :P
Feb 24 02:34:31 <benoitj>	once you understand and see the benefit, it's hard to go without that feature
Feb 24 02:35:14 <Motaik>	:(  . I say i would need more knowledge to fully understand what you said. But one thing is certain. The more simple things are, i preferer it
Feb 24 02:36:24 <Motaik>	for the moment, the abillity to roll back to previous generations is pretty neat for me
Feb 24 02:36:54 <Motaik>	but i'll try nix out soon! and flake some things up
Feb 24 02:37:03 <benoitj>	oh yeah, that is great
Feb 24 02:37:12 <benoitj>	^ rolling back
Feb 24 02:37:22 <Motaik>	it is!
Feb 24 02:37:44 <Motaik>	it is funny tho
Feb 24 02:38:09 <Motaik>	the more i dive in the linux world. more i discover how little i know
Feb 24 02:38:29 <Motaik>	i see myself trying new things all the time
Feb 24 02:38:34 <benoitj>	dont worry, it wont stop
Feb 24 02:38:38 <Motaik>	yeah ahahah
Feb 24 02:39:22 <benoitj>	been using linux for the past 27 years and I still learn
Feb 24 02:39:47 <Motaik>	wow! thats awesome!
Feb 24 02:39:55 <Motaik>	more time than i'm alive
Feb 24 02:40:10 <benoitj>	I think it's 27, started around 96-98
Feb 24 02:40:17 <benoitj>	wow
Feb 24 02:40:19 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 24 02:40:19 <Motaik>	i'm from 98
Feb 24 02:40:24 <benoitj>	makes me feel old
Feb 24 02:40:29 <Motaik>	nah
Feb 24 02:40:45 <Motaik>	you're just getting better
Feb 24 02:40:47 <benoitj>	i'm 28 for the past many years
Feb 24 02:41:11 <Motaik>	hahaha. What matters is what in your heart
Feb 24 02:41:54 <benoitj>	only way to roll :)
Feb 24 02:42:45 <Motaik>	trues to that
Feb 24 02:44:06 <Motaik>	just to say, thanks for the help
Feb 24 02:44:21 <benoitj>	pleasure
Feb 24 02:44:37 <Motaik>	its great seeing some fellow unix users that are willing to spread the word
Feb 24 02:44:59 <benoitj>	honestly, this community is great for that. everyone's friendly
Feb 24 02:45:40 <Motaik>	yeah! most of the times i had an issue, or just chatted with someone, they've always been so kind
Feb 24 02:46:12 <Motaik>	kindness is at fault sometimes. And I for one appreciate it
Feb 24 02:46:54 <benoitj>	happy bunch of people who like to learn, experiment and share
Feb 24 02:47:30 <Motaik>	it's the way!
Feb 24 02:48:24 <Motaik>	benoitj: i'll leave for now. But will try to connect here around this time in the next days
Feb 24 02:48:32 <Motaik>	it's an honor to meet you
Feb 24 02:48:35 <benoitj>	bye
Feb 24 02:48:41 <benoitj>	have fun with guix
Feb 24 02:48:47 <Motaik>	Will do!

Feb 24 12:19:00 <trev>	hello
Feb 24 12:19:04 <trev>	that doesn't sound very fun
Feb 24 12:25:42 <glenneth>	Hi mretka o/
Feb 24 12:25:55 <glenneth>	teesh3rt: alternateved o/
Feb 24 12:33:13 <trev>	i'm still giggling about the distrobox stream
Feb 24 12:33:32 <trev>	guix is so borked up i want to use it just to feel somethin
Feb 24 12:34:56 <trev>	i'll start streaming too and my name will be High on Guix and every stream will just be me screwing up the system so hard that i have to start over. the running gag will be that i never save my config so i never have reproducible builds
Feb 24 12:36:11 <mretka>	lol
Feb 24 12:36:27 <mretka>	Sounds like yesterday's stream was fun, I couldn't watch it yet
Feb 24 12:36:50 <mretka>	trev yeah, it's as fun as it sounds, not much, but anyway, should be done this morning
Feb 24 12:37:02 <mretka>	Then I'll have some open space in my place
Feb 24 12:37:22 <mretka>	It's the landlord's fridge that I'm returning to them
Feb 24 12:37:43 <mretka>	Because I got another one into the apartment last month, their fridge broke down and couldn't be fixed
Feb 24 12:48:27 <daviwil>	trev: sounds like a good idea to me
Feb 24 13:08:55 <ashraz>	Hello Crafters
Feb 24 13:23:28 <mretka>	Hello ashraz daviwil :)
Feb 24 13:26:15 <trev>	hey ashraz 
Feb 24 13:33:27 <alternateved>	Hi ashraz 
Feb 24 13:33:36 <alternateved>	You were missing yesterday. Missing hard
Feb 24 13:35:52 <ashraz>	Sorry :(
Feb 24 13:36:22 <alternateved>	leftpad went on a rampage
Feb 24 13:37:27 <ashraz>	Heh. I just skipped the start of the video. "Today we're going to look at Distrobox in Guix. It doesn't work... But we're gonna make it work!"
Feb 24 13:37:35 <ashraz>	That's a leftpad line if I ever heard one 
Feb 24 13:37:45 <ashraz>	*leftpad summoning
Feb 24 13:38:19 <alternateved>	:D
Feb 24 13:48:15 <daviwil>	Yes indeed 
Feb 24 13:48:31 <daviwil>	I taunted the Gods and I got what I deserved 
Feb 24 13:48:43 <ashraz>	Still skipping through the stream. 47minutes in: Tetris.
Feb 24 13:49:12 <daviwil>	I'm gonna be a professional Emacs tetris streamer 
Feb 24 13:49:16 <ashraz>	So.... switching tracks into gaming streams?
Feb 24 13:49:35 <ashraz>	Could combine Gaming + Emacs into Emacs CTF Hacking Streams :D
Feb 24 13:51:37 <ashraz>	lol @ M-x doctor. We need a special pattern for "stream" and "error|failure|crash|derail" where the doctor answers: "You should blame leftpad"
Feb 24 13:53:28 <alternateved>	Maybe Gaming With Guix
Feb 24 13:53:59 <alternateved>	Thought it also sounds hellish 
Feb 24 13:54:37 <ashraz>	alternateved: it sounds easier to mount a live system, run takeover.sh, then use said live system to install Debian testing or Fedora and then play games there 😅
Feb 24 13:54:57 <ashraz>	Or does Guix have Flatpak integration?
Feb 24 13:55:33 <alternateved>	Yeah, most likely Steam from Flatpak would work okay
Feb 24 13:55:50 <morganw>	See: https://boilingsteam.com/i-love-arch-but-gnu-guix-is-my-new-distro/
Feb 24 13:56:36 <morganw>	> I have my VR and Steam gaming just as before on Arch.
Feb 24 13:57:14 <ashraz>	Hm... I need to reinstall Linux on my Yoga X390 either way.
Feb 24 13:57:22 <ashraz>	I could actually switch to Guix...
Feb 24 13:58:32 <ashraz>	Background: Tumbleweed worked fine, but one of the Thinkapd Pen Pro buttons wasn't working; neither on the included, nor on the replacement pen. Turns out, Lenovo has a special f****ng app that you need in addition to the Wacom drivers.
Feb 24 13:58:53 <ashraz>	Only available on Windows atm. The second button simply doesn't work with libwacom+libinput.
Feb 24 14:01:20 <theesm>	Good morning folks 
Feb 24 14:01:56 <ashraz>	Hey theesm 
Feb 24 14:02:41 <daviwil>	Yeah, I install Steam via Flatpak on Guix, works fine
Feb 24 14:03:34 <alternateved>	Hi theesm 
Feb 24 14:05:03 <ashraz>	Hm, speaking about games... SystemCrafters Xonotic instagib match when?
Feb 24 14:05:43 <daviwil>	I hadn't heard of that one, and it's in Guix...
Feb 24 14:05:57 <daviwil>	that looks pretty fun, old Quake Arena / UT style
Feb 24 14:07:09 <ashraz>	Exactly
Feb 24 14:08:00 <daviwil>	definitely something worth considering
Feb 24 14:08:03 <ashraz>	It's a fork of Nexuiz, after that one became closed source (and later switched to CryEngine)
Feb 24 14:19:31 <mretka>	lol ashraz 
Feb 24 14:22:19 <mretka>	Lately I'm just playing with Jupyter Notebooks hehe
Feb 24 14:56:34 <daviwil>	xonotic is pretty cool, just launched it
Feb 24 15:15:04 <nm0i>	Sweet, I'm having memory leaks somewhere in emacs...
Feb 24 15:25:30 <talos>	Ugh fine, I'll run a Xonotic server on my own server people here can join :D
Feb 24 15:28:21 <talos>	Good day all
Feb 24 15:28:36 <nm0i>	Morning, talos.
Feb 24 15:44:13 <talos>	Heyo nm0i!
Feb 24 15:50:30 <talos>	OK, Xonotic server anyone can join here is up and running!
Feb 24 15:51:03 <talos>	Search for "Lagrange Point Xonotic server" in the server tab in Xonotic and there ya go~
Feb 24 15:55:59 <ashraz>	Huh
Feb 24 15:56:16 <ashraz>	Was gone for two hours (Secret of Monkey Island 2), will join in a minute
Feb 24 15:56:28 <talos>	Cool~
Feb 24 15:56:44 <talos>	Just lemme know when you're on and I'll join too
Feb 24 15:57:45 <ashraz>	Probably need to update first, my Xonotic folder is from 2017
Feb 24 15:58:01 <talos>	Oh wow, yeah
Feb 24 15:58:28 <daviwil>	I like the idea of organizing the occasional community game session, that would be fun
Feb 24 15:58:52 <talos>	Yeah, agreed
Feb 24 15:58:57 <ashraz>	talos: but IIRC, there was a rsync based updater in there, let me check...
Feb 24 15:59:17 <ashraz>	Ah yeah. misc/tools/rsync-updater/update-to-release.bat
Feb 24 15:59:26 <talos>	Noice~
Feb 24 15:59:41 <ashraz>	talos: did you set any special rules/mods? Or is that classic?
Feb 24 15:59:59 <talos>	No special rules or mods yet lol
Feb 24 16:00:14 <talos>	So yeah, just classic deathmatch for now
Feb 24 16:01:04 <talos>	I would have to look up how to do that from NixOS
Feb 24 16:01:08 <ashraz>	Alright - need to check my name, might be something vaguley ironic like "Weeeeee" (the sound you make when you fly around via hookshot)
Feb 24 16:01:10 <talos>	If you wanted it
Feb 24 16:01:20 <daviwil>	lol
Feb 24 16:01:22 <teesh3rt>	hello!
Feb 24 16:01:28 <talos>	Hiya!
Feb 24 16:01:51 <ashraz>	Should probably set my Xonotic nick to "rightpad"
Feb 24 16:02:08 <daviwil>	yes
Feb 24 16:02:10 <talos>	lol
Feb 24 16:03:17 <talos>	I was also hosting a Minetest server but for some reason it won't generate a world anymore =/
Feb 24 16:03:32 <talos>	SO still need to figure out how to fix that
Feb 24 16:04:46 <tdback>	morning crafters
Feb 24 16:04:51 <ashraz>	Oh !leftpad. I accidentally updated Xonotic while it was running in the background...
Feb 24 16:05:20 <talos>	Oops :X
Feb 24 16:05:21 <daviwil>	oops
Feb 24 16:05:36 <talos>	Morning tdback
Feb 24 16:05:53 <ashraz>	talos: Alright, severname was Lagrange Point something, right?
Feb 24 16:05:55 <talos>	Hope it works ok ashraz
Feb 24 16:06:05 <talos>	Yeah, Lagrange Point
Feb 24 16:06:18 <ashraz>	Uh, 200ms ping
Feb 24 16:06:43 <talos>	Uh oh lol
Feb 24 16:06:47 <ashraz>	time travel dm
Feb 24 16:07:18 <talos>	I have the server located in the US
Feb 24 16:07:24 <talos>	Maybe that's why lol
Feb 24 16:07:40 <talos>	Lemme join right quick
Feb 24 16:08:12 <daviwil>	200ms ping, just enough to get the drop on ashraz
Feb 24 16:08:23 <daviwil>	excuse me, rightpad
Feb 24 16:09:26 <tdback>	A free quake-esk game? Yes please

Feb 24 16:38:02 <nm0i>	A humbling reminder that modern shooters are too easy.
Feb 24 16:38:08 <ashraz>	That was fun
Feb 24 16:38:31 <nm0i>	Ye
Feb 24 16:40:28 <ashraz>	Were all four of us from #systemcrafters, or did we have a random at the end?
Feb 24 16:41:44 <benoitj>	morning folks
Feb 24 16:44:42 <ashraz>	Had a quick look at the server list. Nice to see that exe.pub still exists and is still running
Feb 24 16:44:44 <BigEatie>	Need to get a controller or something...don't think my trackball mouse would be any good for a fps
Feb 24 16:45:13 <ashraz>	BigEatie: What's the issue with a regular mouse?
Feb 24 16:45:46 <benoitj>	ashraz: which game? 
Feb 24 16:46:04 <BigEatie>	Not sure there's an issue with em, just haven't used one in likely 15 years with any regularity
Feb 24 16:46:06 <ashraz>	benoitj: Xonotic. talos has set up a server ("Lagrange Point")
Feb 24 16:46:18 <BigEatie>	And if I'm getting something specifically for gaming, I think I'd get a controller.
Feb 24 16:46:36 <ashraz>	Yeah, but against mouse players you'd have a disadvantage
Feb 24 16:46:52 <ashraz>	Arena shooters don't have aim assist
Feb 24 16:47:03 <BigEatie>	I'm terrible at FPS to begin with...I'd be slightly more last place lol
Feb 24 16:47:11 <ashraz>	Fair enough :D
Feb 24 16:47:17 <benoitj>	OK, will install that
Feb 24 16:48:26 <ashraz>	Have fun. I need to go, a friend of mine moves to New Zealand, so we're having a farewell party.
Feb 24 16:48:54 <nm0i>	Well, I played with talos and ashraz earlier with trackball, didn't feel any issues related to it.
Feb 24 16:49:19 <nm0i>	So maybe try first.
Feb 24 16:54:20 <teesh3rt>	ok i just checked out the xonotic site
Feb 24 16:54:25 <teesh3rt>	looks like a pretty cool game
Feb 24 16:54:27 <teesh3rt>	might try later
Feb 24 16:56:26 <morganw>	Looking at the downloads, you have to download binaries for all 3 platforms? https://xonotic.org/download/
Feb 24 16:57:48 <morganw>	I am downloading to see, but my connection is not fast so it will take 10 minutes.
Feb 24 17:13:43 <morganw>	Is does cover Windows, macOS, and Linux.  It is a bit confusing to know which executable to start.
Feb 24 17:16:05 <BigEatie>	nm0i: interestring, remember not liking it in the past,but it's been probably a decade since I've played, so maybe I'll give it another go
Feb 24 17:18:43 <nm0i>	I just used nix package...
Feb 24 17:18:49 <nm0i>	:)
Feb 24 17:20:30 <morganw>	On Windows there are 3 executables per architecture. https://paste.sr.ht/~mew/d4f8b4569208150cbc81553d90588c3d9b155a41
Feb 24 17:21:13 <morganw>	I guess just try xonotic.exe and presume the simplest name is the correct one.
Feb 24 17:22:13 <teesh3rt>	im installing the game rn, it looks very interesting

Feb 24 17:32:23 <morganw>	I gave it a try and it does seem pretty good, although I never played Quake 3.
Feb 24 17:34:06 <talos>	I'm more used to unreal tournament but I did enjoy quake death match back in the day lol
Feb 24 17:34:24 <teesh3rt>	ok i tried it now, my first time playing anything like it, pretty fun just fragging people
Feb 24 17:34:34 <naokotani>	benoitj: I ended up getting ob-plantuml working. I was trying to use it to export the whole buffer and then realized that its more like org babel tangle
Feb 24 17:44:07 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 24 17:44:24 <benoitj>	it generates the image in your org as an output
Feb 24 17:49:43 <naokotani>	yeah, very cool. 
Feb 24 17:50:15 <naokotani>	99.9% of bugs are actually caused by me being a goofball
Feb 24 17:51:38 <benoitj>	that is called learning :)
Feb 24 17:55:30 <sahil_>	Hi, I heard that we are running short on graphics programmers?
Feb 24 17:55:49 <sahil_>	Everyone around me is webdev this way or the other (I am in college).
Feb 24 17:56:28 <naokotani>	I think a lot of people do web dev, but there is also a lot of web dev that needs doing
Feb 24 17:57:48 <sahil_>	naokotani: Most of them are frameworkers :)
Feb 24 18:02:35 <benoitj>	not sure I understand his questions and points
Feb 24 18:16:12 <naokotani>	sahil1_: I am in college myself, but most job listing I see in web development seem to expect people to be familiar with one or more frontend frameworks
Feb 24 18:17:35 <sahil1_>	Not to forget leetcode 
Feb 24 18:17:54 <naokotani>	One musn't forget leetcode
Feb 24 18:19:45 <naokotani>	benoitj: if you do my UML assignment for me, I'll be your best friend
Feb 24 18:21:38 <benoitj>	haha, i've done my assignments
Feb 24 18:25:46 <sahil_>	and I wait for the deadlines.
Feb 24 18:25:53 <naokotani>	yes, but have you done /my/ assignments
Feb 24 18:36:30 <benoitj>	my hourly rate is probably too high
Feb 24 18:36:54 <benoitj>	hourly rate on my personal time :)
Feb 24 18:37:33 <sahil_>	Hi, so giving some context on the computer graphics programming again. I want to have a Job in C++, to become good at it, and then become capable enough to a) make my own game, b) make something like a modern emacs ;) c) contribute lifelong to some projects like gimp libreoffice etc.
Feb 24 18:38:11 <benoitj>	good to have objectives
Feb 24 18:38:22 <sahil_>	Once in a libreoffice desing meeting, a Senior Dev said that it's hard to find experienced C++ graphics programmers, and reddit had a similar sentiment.
Feb 24 18:39:03 <sahil_>	I have 2.5 years of my college left, and so plan to become an expert at that. What do you know about it?
Feb 24 18:39:44 <benoitj>	you may want to also expand into rust, which seems to be a good fit / complementary skill
Feb 24 18:41:07 <sahil_>	benoitj: Yes, but I will do that once I know some basics and have built some projects, or else I will waste time just learning language basics over and over. (I can survive C++ for the time being)
Feb 24 18:41:17 <benoitj>	zcool
Feb 24 18:43:41 <naokotani>	I was mostly joking. Acually I am sort of having fun with it
Feb 24 18:44:14 <naokotani>	https://ctrl.vi/i/Vh0ZPahec
Feb 24 18:44:37 <naokotani>	This took me like. idk 2 minutes. better than dealing with draw.io or whatever I was trying to use before
Feb 24 18:44:56 <naokotani>	obviously its very simple, but like I feel like it was pretty easy for having no experience with it
Feb 24 18:50:17 <benoitj>	naokotani: I know :) 
Feb 24 18:50:24 <benoitj>	i was also joking
Feb 24 18:51:42 <naokotani>	has anyone ever noticed/had an issue where insetinga  new line in org src block causes tabs to get added and/or random indentation to occur?
Feb 24 18:58:59 <Fade>	Good Morning
Feb 24 18:59:03 <benoitj>	weird indent yes. I use org edit special usually for larger block
Feb 24 18:59:07 <benoitj>	hey Fade 
Feb 24 19:00:00 <naokotani>	oh i didn't know about edit special. that's really cool thanks
Feb 24 19:00:09 <Fade>	heya benoit
Feb 24 19:01:51 <benoitj>	yeah, it narrow the block and load the right major mode
Feb 24 19:02:02 <benoitj>	Fade: how's everything today?
Feb 24 19:07:01 <Fade>	it has been a busy morning of mostly household chores. 
Feb 24 19:07:08 <Fade>	grocery shopping, cleaning &etc.
Feb 24 19:08:17 <Fade>	now I'm sitting at the machine, and I have about twenty tasks with equal urgency values and I'm seized by indecision. 
Feb 24 19:08:20 <Fade>	:)
Feb 24 19:12:43 <naokotani>	roll d20
Feb 24 19:12:48 <naokotani>	assign each task to a number
Feb 24 19:12:50 <naokotani>	or d12
Feb 24 19:13:09 <naokotani>	or whatever, you said 20, but if it was hyperbole adjust the die
Feb 24 19:13:10 <Fade>	well, now I'm going to be implementing a dice plugin in my irc bot.
Feb 24 19:13:36 <naokotani>	I can see why that would be maximum urgency
Feb 24 19:13:53 <nm0i>	I can roll my dice myself.
Feb 24 19:13:57 *	nm0i rolls 20.
Feb 24 19:13:59 <nm0i>	See?..
Feb 24 19:14:29 <Fade>	I think the value comes when we're all playing pathfinder together in the darkest reaches of the night

Feb 25 02:25:59 <BigEatie>	Anyone play xonotic on EXWM?
Feb 25 03:59:08 <tdback>	Xonotic is quite fun, thanks for the earlier mention talos and ashraz
Feb 25 04:03:05 <benoitj>	morning folks
Feb 25 04:03:16 <benoitj>	looks like xonotic is fun :)
Feb 25 04:40:55 <tdback>	benoitj: indeed it is :)
Feb 25 04:41:17 <tdback>	BigEatie: I play it on bspwm, just throw it into fullscreen and have fun :)
Feb 25 05:16:45 <cow_2001>	turns out citizens of the USA do not own games https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAD5iMe0Xj4
Feb 25 05:44:39 <talos>	Was playing Persona 3 Reload lol
Feb 25 05:45:06 <benoitj>	playing dayz with my daughter
Feb 25 05:45:21 <talos>	Also looking forward to Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
Feb 25 05:45:30 <talos>	Ooh cool
Feb 25 05:46:04 <talos>	Glad I was able to get a Xonotic server running :D
Feb 25 05:53:45 <naokotan1>	Probably won't play much until Shadows of the Erdtree comes out
Feb 25 05:54:29 <daviwil>	naokotan1: I still need to play the base Elden Ring all the way through
Feb 25 05:55:36 <naokotan1>	daviwil: I wish I could say that. I beat the base game about 10 times with different stat combos and then started doing things like daggers only, single weapon, no magic runs
Feb 25 05:55:48 <daviwil>	that's pretty awesome
Feb 25 05:56:04 <naokotan1>	I even did a fat rolling run lol
Feb 25 05:56:26 <daviwil>	that's what I like about the Souls games, the mechanics are so rich that you can play the game 100 different ways and it's still fun
Feb 25 05:56:30 <naokotan1>	Beat the entire game overloaded with a strength no magic build
Feb 25 05:57:11 <naokotan1>	yeah, there is so muchr replayability in that game. Appanretly they are adding 8 new weapon classes, which is a huge increase
Feb 25 05:57:47 <naokotan1>	I played through dark souls 3 twice. I tried ds1, but it just felt too dated even witht he remake
Feb 25 05:58:13 <naokotan1>	Have you played Sekiro at all?
Feb 25 05:58:31 <daviwil>	Dark Souls 1 is so awesome, it's worth playing despite that
Feb 25 05:58:42 <daviwil>	I tried playing Sekiro a few times but never made it that far
Feb 25 05:58:51 <daviwil>	Mainly because I didn't have time to invest in it
Feb 25 05:59:15 <naokotan1>	Yeah thats me right now. I feel like my wife doesn't want me playing games unitl I have a coding job lol
Feb 25 05:59:35 <daviwil>	well, it makes sense!
Feb 25 05:59:52 <daviwil>	but gaming is a good way to take a break from grinding job stuff
Feb 25 06:00:28 <naokotan1>	Yeah. I have an extremely one track mind. I get too invested in one thing and if thats gaming im not being productive
Feb 25 06:01:49 <naokotan1>	nonetheless. I will be putting work on the back burner for a couple weeks when the elden ring dlc comes out
Feb 25 06:02:22 <trev>	and disobey your wife's orders?
Feb 25 06:02:39 <trev>	no gaming for me. had to blast away windows partition to escape it
Feb 25 06:03:58 <daviwil>	I respect that
Feb 25 06:04:35 <daviwil>	I've tried giving up gaming in the past, but what I realized is that I just need to come up with projects that are more interesting than gaming and things become easier to balance
Feb 25 06:06:50 <naokotan1>	I get a lot of gaming peer pressure and its the only way I can really connect with friends back home
Feb 25 06:07:31 <naokotan1>	of coures, that doesn't explain all my diablo 2 resurrected single player hours last fall ol
Feb 25 06:09:05 <cow_2001>	if you're trying to beat up a gaming habit, try cocaine!
Feb 25 06:09:20 <daviwil>	I don't think that's going to help
Feb 25 06:10:32 <naokotan1>	yeah, pretty sure if I did cocaine it would result in my playing videos games all night
Feb 25 06:11:02 <cow_2001>	maybe even give you better attention?
Feb 25 06:11:15 <cow_2001>	is ritalin cocaine-like?
Feb 25 06:11:21 <naokotan1>	sort of
Feb 25 06:11:36 <trev>	naokotan1: i actually have a lot of gaming peer pressure too. hard to give up when you have friends that want to game all the time
Feb 25 06:11:39 <cow_2001>	i really need to go to sleep.  guarding the cat all night is hard
Feb 25 06:11:41 <naokotan1>	I have't had amphetamine
Feb 25 06:11:42 <cow_2001>	injured
Feb 25 06:11:58 <cow_2001>	good night
Feb 25 06:12:24 <trev>	gnite cow_2001 
Feb 25 06:12:33 <talos>	Nite cow_2001
Feb 25 06:13:08 <naokotan1>	I think part of the issue with gaming is that there is profit motive to make it addictive over satisfying
Feb 25 06:13:16 <naokotan1>	similar to social media
Feb 25 06:13:20 <trev>	i've done a one year full no gaming before and it felt good. once i realized how much of a time sink it is, i can't shake the guilt
Feb 25 06:14:39 <naokotan1>	I played a lot of games the last few years. I have been doing night shift for 3.5 years and it was a way to keep me occupied over a long nights 
Feb 25 06:14:42 <trev>	also keep in mind i used to put in like 12 hour shifts of counter strike that would just be during work hours
Feb 25 06:15:20 <naokotan1>	yeah, so my job im not REALLY expected to do much other than be awake all night
Feb 25 06:16:03 <naokotan1>	I go through long periods where I will do a lot of coding, but then the willpower to self start dries up
Feb 25 06:16:06 <trev>	perfect time to learn something useful
Feb 25 06:16:35 <trev>	yep i know that feeling
Feb 25 06:17:14 <naokotan1>	Although recently I found anohter hobby maybe you guys should try, warhammer
Feb 25 06:17:27 <naokotan1>	painting the guys, building the battlefields
Feb 25 06:19:13 <daviwil>	no thanks
Feb 25 06:19:18 <daviwil>	I already use Emacs
Feb 25 06:20:03 <naokotan1>	Warhammer. The other other emacs
Feb 25 06:20:35 <trev>	100% no way LOL
Feb 25 06:21:30 <trev>	i'm more on the side of becoming a forest recluse and building a log cabin instead of that mega-nerd stuff
Feb 25 06:21:56 <naokotan1>	lol
Feb 25 06:21:58 <BigEatie`>	trev: If I had the skills, that'd be my thing too
Feb 25 06:22:01 <trev>	have a friend who paints those guys though :']
Feb 25 06:22:04 <naokotan1>	I don't see it being more nerd than gaming really
Feb 25 06:22:22 <trev>	the artistic part is nice
Feb 25 06:22:23 <naokotan1>	I already built a house in the woods, so I guess im over it
Feb 25 06:22:48 <BigEatie`>	Is there a community of emacs users who build houses in the woods?
Feb 25 06:23:03 <naokotan1>	There is an overlap
Feb 25 06:23:22 <trev>	it's always like that, huh? i think i read something about that, where people who worked trades want to do a tech job and then people who work in tech want to do labor jobs eventually 
Feb 25 06:23:22 <naokotan1>	the people that want to build their editor for scratch probabl also want to do it with their house
Feb 25 06:24:07 <naokotan1>	trev: that's called humans consistently wanting what they don't have
Feb 25 06:24:56 <naokotan1>	aka the three poisons
Feb 25 06:25:03 <naokotan1>	delusion, desire, aversion
Feb 25 06:25:25 <daviwil>	the Buddha's always right
Feb 25 06:25:37 <naokotan1>	idk about always, but he had some real bangers for sure
Feb 25 06:26:33 <naokotan1>	you could make the point that it's a big part of what drives innovation though
Feb 25 06:27:42 <naokotan1>	Why does javadoc want me to comment the main function? It feels like its a bit self evident
Feb 25 06:28:07 <daviwil>	god demands obedience
Feb 25 06:28:26 <naokotan1>	to be fair, its only a warning
Feb 25 06:28:47 <naokotan1>	but im too OCD to leave the warning, so I guess I am going to need to comment hte main function
Feb 25 06:29:13 <naokotan1>	"This is the main function. It's where the magic starts"
Feb 25 06:30:18 <naokotan1>	"This is my main function. There are many like it, but this one is mine."
Feb 25 06:49:09 <naokotan1>	anyone happen to be a javadoc expert?
Feb 25 06:49:57 <trev>	intellij is 
Feb 25 06:50:24 <benoitj>	what do you mean. I work with java for the past 26 years
Feb 25 06:51:14 <benoitj>	naokotani: you dont repeat what the function tells
Feb 25 06:51:36 <naokotan1>	benoitj: you do when that's what the assignment tells you to do
Feb 25 06:51:42 <benoitj>	javadoc is typically only for public exposed libraries. the rest, if it needs javadoc, it's because the code is bad
Feb 25 06:52:35 <naokotan1>	We are supposed to produce a javadoc file, but for some reason when I run javadoc -d doc Main.java it only produces documentation for the Main class
Feb 25 06:52:39 <benoitj>	but you question is "any javadoc expert"
Feb 25 06:52:53 <benoitj>	oh, we never do that. we use maven or gradle to build our javadoc
Feb 25 06:53:30 <benoitj>	javadoc should accept a "classpath" just give it your source folder
Feb 25 06:54:49 <benoitj>	--source-path :)
Feb 25 06:55:58 <benoitj>	man javadoc
Feb 25 06:56:46 <naokotan1>	lol thanks
Feb 25 07:08:51 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 25 07:14:18 <glenneth>	Morning Folx o/
Feb 25 07:16:57 <naokotan1>	Mroning
Feb 25 07:28:27 <naokotan1>	Appanrelty I can get intellij free
Feb 25 07:28:32 <naokotan1>	maybe it can figure out how to do it for me
Feb 25 07:30:02 <glenneth>	Hey naokotan1 :) Intellij?
Feb 25 07:33:40 <glenneth>	It's an IDE?
Feb 25 07:35:04 <trev>	yep for java
Feb 25 07:35:29 <trev>	probably the only way to write java these days since it can do everything for you
Feb 25 07:38:38 <glenneth>	OK.  Hi trev o/
Feb 25 07:38:52 <trev>	hi glenneth. finally a day off for you?
Feb 25 07:39:11 <glenneth>	Yes sir :)
Feb 25 07:43:10 <naokotan1>	I am really not super interested in java, I just have to do it for school so if it can do things for me I am all for it
Feb 25 07:43:30 <naokotan1>	I am sure Java is wonderful, but just doesn't interest me personally
Feb 25 07:47:19 <trev>	it sure is a nice money-maker
Feb 25 07:47:35 <trev>	the businessman's programming language
Feb 25 07:47:50 <trev>	i was java's prisoner for 6.5 years
Feb 25 07:51:02 <naokotan1>	yeah I mean. if someone is crazy enough to give me a job writing java I will do it
Feb 25 07:55:40 <naokotan1>	I will say, I spend a lot of time doing web stuff, and I don't see it being used a crazy amount for that
Feb 25 07:56:02 <naokotan1>	seems like its more, as you say, the business software side of things
Feb 25 08:02:09 <trev>	java webapps are huge
Feb 25 08:02:42 <trev>	i caught the tail end of using JSP stuff 
Feb 25 08:03:08 <trev>	i guess nowadays you can make good money doing some javascrit fullstack
Feb 25 08:04:34 <naokotan1>	yeah
Feb 25 08:04:52 <naokotan1>	I mean, its not that I don't see jobs posted for java, but its just one in the pack it feels like
Feb 25 08:05:01 <naokotan1>	idk, I havne't done a scientific survey or anything
Feb 25 08:06:18 <BigEatie`>	Dating myself here, but I haven't done any Java since the web applet days... All of our HS CS stuff was Java back then.
Feb 25 08:07:35 <BigEatie`>	I think we were using netbeans back then, can't remember
Feb 25 08:08:12 <BigEatie`>	I do remember using it to get around a lot of things that were blocked on the computer though
Feb 25 08:08:50 <BigEatie`>	regedit was disabled, but Java programs were not disabled from editing the registry, lol
Feb 25 08:10:32 <glenneth>	Hey BigEatie` o/
Feb 25 08:10:53 <BigEatie`>	Howdy!
Feb 25 08:11:15 <trev>	BigEatie`: nice! netbeans
Feb 25 08:18:10 <naokotan1>	oohhh baby. it took 30 minutes but if finally downloaded
Feb 25 08:18:14 <naokotan1>	its intellij time 
Feb 25 08:38:47 <naokotan1>	This is going ot actually drive me insane
Feb 25 08:38:58 <naokotan1>	it just refuses to add the classes to the javadoc
Feb 25 08:39:20 <naokotan1>	spending an entire night messing with this was so not on my todo list lol
Feb 25 08:49:50 <glenneth>	 gotta run.  House chores and I have to try and catch up on my homework before the final guile session this afternoon :)  See you all later o7
Feb 25 08:50:52 <trev>	naokotan1: you should just find a popular java project and copy it at this point
Feb 25 08:54:15 <naokotan1>	We are supposed to do this specific one
Feb 25 08:54:50 <naokotan1>	I literally
Feb 25 08:55:20 <naokotan1>	created a new project in intellij, copied overa ll the classes, had it generate the javadoc comments, it runs and works fine
Feb 25 08:55:25 <naokotan1>	I run generate javadoc
Feb 25 08:55:31 <naokotan1>	and its jsut the main class
Feb 25 08:56:10 <trev>	so it's good?
Feb 25 08:56:55 <naokotan1>	no. its documenting only the main class and none of hte other classes and methods. it makes no damn sense. 
Feb 25 09:00:00 <naokotan1>	omg
Feb 25 09:00:20 <naokotan1>	I finally see an error "there is no public class in this file"
Feb 25 09:00:35 <naokotan1>	they code they gave us is undocumentable lol
Feb 25 09:00:40 <naokotan1>	becaues its all private classes
Feb 25 09:01:19 <trev>	lol
Feb 25 09:03:00 <naokotan1>	the assignment is to write javadoc for classes that can't be javadoced. 
Feb 25 09:03:03 <naokotan1>	10/10
Feb 25 09:03:50 <naokotan1>	about as good as my assignemnt that fullfills the course objectives by telling me to find a course that fulfills the course objectives
Feb 25 09:07:51 <naokotan1>	what if then the other course I find simply gives me an assignment that tells me to find a course that fulfills hte course objectives?
Feb 25 09:08:48 <naokotan1>	At what point do I reach Maximum call stack size exceeded?
Feb 25 10:05:45 <daviwil>	phew, just finished the content for the last week of the Guile course
Feb 25 10:07:48 <BigEatie`>	Congrats!
Feb 25 10:08:18 <daviwil>	thanks!  It was a lot of work to produce the whole thing, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out
Feb 25 10:08:24 <daviwil>	lots of areas of improvement though
Feb 25 10:09:33 <BigEatie`>	Yea man, I don't know how you do it at the rate you do, I tried my hand at doing videos and it and it is a ton of work
Feb 25 10:09:58 <BigEatie`>	Looking forward to the next session! Going to sign up.
Feb 25 10:14:17 <mretka>	Congrats daviwil 🎉🎉🎉💪
Feb 25 10:15:53 <trev>	awesome, daviwil! now we can finally afford that yacht you promised to buy us
Feb 25 10:29:28 <daviwil>	trev: lol, I'm never gonna have yacht money teaching about Guile 
Feb 25 10:30:03 <daviwil>	That'll come after I create another scheme: a pyramid scheme 
Feb 25 10:36:25 <trev>	hahaaa!!
Feb 25 10:39:41 <sahil_>	And I moved from DWM to kde.
Feb 25 10:40:11 <sahil_>	Too much extensibility and options were distracting, and I was scripting the whole day there.
Feb 25 10:41:13 <sahil_>	Now I use thunderbird, instead of weechat and neomutt.
Feb 25 10:41:36 <trev>	next stop: MacOS 
Feb 25 10:42:53 <sahil_>	No. Kde is enough. Pacman and aur X Kde == work all day, and don't be a config wizard. 
Feb 25 10:43:55 <sahil_>	And the argument of creating an installer script for the system also falls short, as how often would you change computers? maybe once in 8 months or an year probably.
Feb 25 10:44:10 <trev>	"config wizard" is offensive to "system crafters"
Feb 25 10:44:35 <trev>	haven't changed computers in 7 years actually
Feb 25 10:47:17 <daviwil>	trev: I wouldn't call it offensive, system crafting doesnt necessarily require hand edited configs 
Feb 25 10:48:00 <daviwil>	My deal isn't so much about changing computers but making a reproducible setup across multiple computers since I use 2 or 3 different computers regularly and I want the same setup on all of them
Feb 25 10:49:16 <trev>	i think sahil_ just doesn't want to get stuck in the "ricing" cycle. it can be a seemingly endless journey, like distrohopping for some people
Feb 25 10:51:38 <sahil_>	trev: exactly. I was working on some patches for libreoffice, but my hands always opened that config file in the first tag, and continued to tinker with fzf X tmux X neovim scripts, so that one shortcut would open fzf, and then the selected entry in tmux. 
Feb 25 10:52:12 <sahil_>	I want to get some work done. Configuring all day makes me feel guilty of not working on what is important.
Feb 25 10:55:17 <trev>	haha that script sounds more interesting than libreoffice
Feb 25 10:58:05 <sahil1_>	Not if I tell you that you might be able to customise libreoffice with css after the patch
Feb 25 11:00:46 <trev>	then i'll just be ricing libreoffice! you're trying to make me rice while you're being productive!
Feb 25 11:05:32 <mretka>	lol
Feb 25 11:05:42 *	mretka is ricing Jupyter Notebooks recently
Feb 25 11:13:55 <vii_majesty>	lol
Feb 25 11:22:35 <thanosapollo>	https://0x0.st/H5Ft.png finally figured out how to use iimage lol

Feb 28 02:10:12 <naokotan1>	precisely
Feb 28 02:10:45 <naokotan1>	currently its "my wife debugging" and she doesn't appreciate it

Feb 29 01:45:53 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/uMwYM ]::[ Binary data ]
Feb 29 02:04:37 <moshh>	do people recommend running erc at startup, or manually calling the function?
Feb 29 02:04:46 <cow_2001>	need to meditate.  anyone wanna join?
Feb 29 02:05:16 <purplg>	moshh: i have a seperate configuration dedicated to ERC and a different them so i can tell them apart. It also launches/connects to Matrix
Feb 29 02:05:49 <moshh>	oh okay, do you connect to many channels? I just have 4
Feb 29 02:05:51 <Marvin2>	oh okay, do you write about for your own mind
Feb 29 02:06:19 <purplg>	moshh: not in IRC, no. P much just here
Feb 29 02:07:01 <moshh>	thanks purplg
Feb 29 02:39:33 <benoitj>	moshh: I just run the function on the emacs instance I use to chat
Feb 29 02:50:50 <moshh>	i suppose its not needed to be run constantly
Feb 29 02:52:13 <benoitj>	mine done
Feb 29 02:52:15 <benoitj>	does
Feb 29 02:52:42 <benoitj>	8 days, 11 hours uptime
Feb 29 02:52:46 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 29 02:53:55 <moshh>	oh I turn my computer(s) off haha
Feb 29 02:54:22 <moshh>	I use the sr.ht bouncer though. I'm not really sure why, I guess I was already paying them for the git
Feb 29 02:54:44 <benoitj>	I use it to connect with my phone
Feb 29 02:55:12 <moshh>	?
Feb 29 02:56:07 <tdback>	I've been too lazy to set up the sr.ht bouncer :P
Feb 29 02:56:18 <tdback>	or any bouncer for that matter
Feb 29 02:57:51 <moshh>	one of my big complaints from IRC many (many) years ago when I was in high school and my friends used it, was that I couldn't see chat history. 
Feb 29 02:58:01 <moshh>	so if I'm going to use it, a bouncer is required
Feb 29 02:58:05 <tdback>	that's what I like about it :)
Feb 29 02:58:07 <Marvin2>	that's what you're going after
Feb 29 02:58:31 <moshh>	to each their own haha
Feb 29 02:58:48 <benoitj>	moshh: connecting with irc on the phone is weird, it keep connecting disconnecting. sometimes also fails to connect
Feb 29 02:58:57 <moshh>	I don't see the point unless I can see context; because I'm not going to have it on my screen 24/7
Feb 29 02:58:59 <Marvin2>	I don't trust scheme is I don't use it though.
Feb 29 02:59:03 <benoitj>	this is from my phone
Feb 29 02:59:10 <benoitj>	and here from my desktop
Feb 29 02:59:50 <benoitj>	lots of power outage tonight. lots of wind
Feb 29 02:59:53 <moshh>	benoitj do you have an android? I'm using goguma and it seems to work without issue. Android has power management which might cause the app to disconnect
Feb 29 03:00:00 <benoitj>	yes, goguma
Feb 29 03:00:13 <benoitj>	but I connect it to chat.sr.ht
Feb 29 03:00:29 <moshh>	same. I don't have any issues. I even get pings when needed
Feb 29 03:00:41 <benoitj>	I was talking, one reason to use a bouncer :)
Feb 29 03:00:42 <moshh>	wild how I had trouble with erc, but not goguma, and its vice-versa for you
Feb 29 03:00:53 <benoitj>	I have no issues for both :P
Feb 29 03:01:02 <moshh>	they're great. I can't imagine using IRC without it...
Feb 29 03:01:08 <benoitj>	i'm saying, connecting directly to libera.chat from phone is messy
Feb 29 03:01:20 <benoitj>	with soju and goguma, it's neet
Feb 29 03:01:21 <benoitj>	neat
Feb 29 03:01:29 <moshh>	agree 100%
Feb 29 04:39:41 <glenneth->	Morning Folx :)

Feb 29 06:05:58 <naokotani>	Moncton I could sort of take or leave
Feb 29 06:06:13 <naokotani>	Fredericton is nice
Feb 29 06:06:21 <glenneth>	Hey naokotani trev o/
Feb 29 06:06:45 <benoitj>	I went mostly in the north of NB
Feb 29 06:07:23 <naokotani>	I've never been there. we went ot st john's and fundy national park
Feb 29 06:07:32 <benoitj>	ok
Feb 29 06:07:42 <benoitj>	my cousins used to live in grand falls
Feb 29 06:07:45 <naokotani>	I can recommend fundy national park
Feb 29 06:08:30 <naokotani>	I think the main thing I like about Nova Scotia that people just feel overall less materialistic than Ontario
Feb 29 06:08:33 <naokotani>	more community minded
Feb 29 06:08:50 <benoitj>	nice
Feb 29 06:09:24 <naokotani>	like they have these huge square dances where they do these sort of gaelic dances
Feb 29 06:09:28 <Marvin2>	like they have killed many millions of people
Feb 29 06:09:36 <naokotani>	lol
Feb 29 06:09:46 <benoitj>	that is hell of a dance
Feb 29 06:09:47 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 29 06:09:58 <naokotani>	there is no killing
Feb 29 06:09:59 <glenneth>	WTF Marvin2 ?? 
Feb 29 06:10:05 <naokotani>	they jsut sort of. they play fiddle and bagpipes
Feb 29 06:10:10 <benoitj>	he's drunk again
Feb 29 06:10:13 <naokotani>	and they sort of idk dance around
Feb 29 06:10:31 <naokotani>	anyway, you just don't find that kind of community even on that scale in rural ontario
Feb 29 06:10:50 <glenneth>	That's a caliegh (kaylee)
Feb 29 06:10:55 <benoitj>	sounds nice
Feb 29 06:11:05 <naokotani>	yeah they spell it.... um
Feb 29 06:11:07 <naokotani>	celidh i think
Feb 29 06:11:21 <glenneth>	It is a gaelic thing
Feb 29 06:11:47 <naokotani>	yeah, i was saying earlier ther eare still a decent numbe rof poele that speak gaelic here
Feb 29 06:12:04 <naokotani>	my son's friend ened up going into gaelic immersion school
Feb 29 06:12:18 <glenneth>	cool
Feb 29 06:13:02 <naokotani>	yeah its neat. my grandfather was actually born in scotland, but where he lived no one spoke gaelic for idk
Feb 29 06:13:05 <naokotani>	a very long time
Feb 29 06:13:13 <naokotani>	glasgow
Feb 29 06:13:32 <benoitj>	ok
Feb 29 06:13:35 <glenneth>	OK
Feb 29 06:13:54 <naokotani>	but these people moved from the really rural parts of scotland where they still spoke it in the 19th century and when they got here it was isolated that they kept speaking it
Feb 29 06:14:02 <naokotani>	and then at some point they put a stop to it
Feb 29 06:14:10 <benoitj>	family comes from north of france, but my ancestor died around 1690 :P
Feb 29 06:14:32 <naokotani>	I know a guy who said if he spoke gaelic as a kid in schol they woul dput his hands on a hot stove top
Feb 29 06:14:40 <naokotani>	but he didn't speak english
Feb 29 06:14:58 <naokotani>	he does now obviously
Feb 29 06:16:04 <naokotani>	its like the acadians
Feb 29 06:16:20 <naokotani>	they tried to clamp down on them too, but there was enough of them that it survived
Feb 29 06:18:27 <naokotani>	Actually we have a lot of miqmaq speakers too
Feb 29 06:18:30 <Marvin2>	Actually we have in mind, but you need to care for commits, just git clone the repository, and then was like well, everyone is really neat.
Feb 29 06:18:32 <naokotani>	on teh island
Feb 29 06:18:47 <naokotani>	so we have french, english, gaelic and miqmaq all on a small island. sort of interesting
Feb 29 06:23:13 <naokotani>	I wonder how to handle a unit test for functions that insert into a database
Feb 29 06:23:16 <Marvin2>	I wonder what the compiler bootstrap story looks like.
Feb 29 06:23:35 <naokotani>	I guess I can just remove them before any kind of production scenario
Feb 29 06:23:50 <benoitj>	naokotani: nice mix
Feb 29 06:24:14 <glenneth>	miqmaq?
Feb 29 06:24:36 <naokotani>	It's an indigenous langauge of the people that are native to parts of eastern canada
Feb 29 06:24:44 <naokotani>	mostly nova scotia and new brunswick
Feb 29 06:25:05 <naokotani>	and probably parts of quebec, though don't quot me on that
Feb 29 06:25:18 <glenneth>	Ahhh.  OK, thanks.  TIL :)
Feb 29 06:25:20 <benoitj>	most likely, but the tribes are different
Feb 29 06:25:42 <naokotani>	yeah, different tribes, but im not sure of the boundaries of the broad cultural group
Feb 29 06:26:11 <benoitj>	we do have micmacs in gaspesie looks like
Feb 29 06:26:29 <benoitj>	so, pretty much north of NB
Feb 29 06:26:55 <naokotani>	yeah, I thought probably, further north yo would get into cree and inuit, but i thought region might be miqmaq
Feb 29 06:27:57 <naokotani>	I guess I could make one test that inserts into the database returns the idea, reads from teh data base and tehn deletes all in one go
Feb 29 06:28:04 <naokotani>	returns the ID
Feb 29 06:28:10 <benoitj>	here it's mostly mohawks and abenaquis
Feb 29 06:28:28 <naokotani>	abenaquis? I havne't heard of that group
Feb 29 06:28:48 <benoitj>	they are next to three rivers
Feb 29 06:29:38 <benoitj>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenaki
Feb 29 06:29:40 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/irJqZ ]::[ Abenaki - Wikipedia ]
Feb 29 06:29:45 <benoitj>	not sure how accurate this is
Feb 29 06:30:15 <naokotani>	oh ok its a subgroup of algonquin
Feb 29 06:31:21 <naokotani>	I would love to visit American in like...
Feb 29 06:31:25 <naokotani>	idk maybe around 1300
Feb 29 06:31:35 <naokotani>	1200
Feb 29 06:31:42 <naokotani>	during mayan times
Feb 29 06:31:47 <naokotani>	but also come up and see canada
Feb 29 06:31:56 <naokotani>	and the us
Feb 29 06:35:36 <benoitj>	my family name has Normans roots
Feb 29 06:53:15 <naokotani>	oh neat
Feb 29 07:02:09 <glenneth__>	Test o/
Feb 29 07:03:40 <glenneth>	benoitj: Which irc client do you use in emacs? 
Feb 29 07:10:46 <glenneth->	That was interesting lol
Feb 29 07:10:48 <Marvin2>	That was interesting but mostly a waste of time
Feb 29 07:11:12 <glenneth->	yup :D
Feb 29 07:22:23 <thanosapollon>	I finally set a old thinkpad as a home server with tailscale, serving RSS-bridge and jellyfin 
Feb 29 07:22:25 <Marvin2>	I finally set a old thinkpad as a kid in schol they woul dput his hands on a small ensemble.
Feb 29 07:23:12 <thanosapollon>	Wtf happened to Marvin? 
Feb 29 07:35:37 <glenneth>	Hey thanosapollon o/  Who knows.  Think he's having a meltdown :D
Feb 29 07:36:17 <glenneth>	RSS-bridge for your feeds?
Feb 29 07:36:39 <thanosapollon>	Hey glenneth! What are you scheming for today? :) 
Feb 29 07:37:10 <thanosapollon>	Yeah for my uni site and others like NYT and medscape that do not provide proper RSS 
Feb 29 07:37:18 <thanosapollon>	If any 
Feb 29 07:37:21 <glenneth>	I'm scheming for my finals :)
Feb 29 07:37:34 <thanosapollon>	Finals on what?
Feb 29 07:38:28 <glenneth>	our last exercises for David's course
Feb 29 07:38:57 <glenneth>	Intro to guile scheme
Feb 29 07:39:52 <thanosapollon>	Whats the exercise task?
Feb 29 07:40:00 <thanosapollon>	David's course sounds fun 
Feb 29 07:42:02 <glenneth>	It was fun
Feb 29 07:43:15 <glenneth>	I don't want to give too much away here in case someone wants to take the class
Feb 29 07:43:44 <thanosapollon>	I see, no spoilers xD 
Feb 29 07:43:53 <daviwil>	it's alright to talk about what we did!  wouldn't take away the experience of actually doing it oneself
Feb 29 07:43:55 <Marvin2>	it's alright to talk about it, but otherwise seems fine.
Feb 29 07:44:02 <daviwil>	shut up Marvin
Feb 29 07:44:08 <glenneth>	Don't want to be *THAT* guy lol
Feb 29 07:44:37 <glenneth>	hey daviwil o/
Feb 29 07:44:40 <daviwil>	I'm gearing up to announce the next iteration today, the course page will give a lot of details anyway
Feb 29 07:44:44 <daviwil>	hey glenneth!
Feb 29 07:45:28 <naokotani>	are you doing a show friday?
Feb 29 07:45:33 <daviwil>	Yep
Feb 29 07:45:39 <naokotani>	nice. any ideas?
Feb 29 07:45:53 <daviwil>	possibly about crafting a minimal writing environment in Emacs
Feb 29 07:45:58 <glenneth>	Cool.  And thanks again for the save yesterday daviwil 
Feb 29 07:46:19 <naokotani>	oh thats right up my alley. I use a combo of org and latex in emacs for all my writing
Feb 29 07:46:30 <daviwil>	glenneth: No worries!  In cases like this, I consider it a problem with the material if someone misses a detail like that
Feb 29 07:46:32 <glenneth>	muchly appreciated
Feb 29 07:47:26 <glenneth>	Should have paid more attention :)
Feb 29 07:47:29 <naokotani>	for org thats the main art of my confid that is still to a large extent your emacs from scartch setup
Feb 29 07:48:14 <naokotani>	so i would be interested to hear how your opinion on it has developed over the yeras
Feb 29 07:49:18 <daviwil>	I'm actually going to be trying a few new packages I haven't used before (mostly written by Prot) to build a config for it
Feb 29 07:50:30 <glenneth>	Nice.  Definitely be catching this weeks stream
Feb 29 07:50:35 <naokotani>	oh wow that sounds dope as hell
Feb 29 07:51:05 <glenneth>	insider knowledge lol
Feb 29 07:53:14 <naokotani>	yeah this is like insider trading
Feb 29 07:53:17 <naokotani>	is this even legal?
Feb 29 07:53:43 <daviwil>	no, I'll be sueing all of you next week!
Feb 29 07:53:50 <daviwil>	suing?
Feb 29 07:54:54 <moshh>	oh dear
Feb 29 07:58:22 <BigEatie>	1st rule of scheme club is we don't talk about scheme club?
Feb 29 07:58:35 <glenneth>	HAHA.  I know nothing
Feb 29 07:58:55 <glenneth>	BigEatie: exactly
Feb 29 08:00:15 <glenneth>	brb - Coffee
Feb 29 08:04:12 <naokotani>	I actually talk about scehem club irl quite a bit
Feb 29 08:04:22 <naokotani>	please don't eject me
Feb 29 08:04:55 <moshh>	is it good? I can't afford it at the moment, but thinking of doing it in the future. I've picked up a bit of programming in general but I think a professional course would be really useful
Feb 29 08:07:07 <moshh>	also has anyone else found Rainer's org mode tutorials insanely helpful? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMlp9HUJI3s&list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE&index=23 I've been taking notes like I do with systemcrafters videos and have learnt a lot
Feb 29 08:07:10 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/VBtvU ]::[ OrgMode E05S03: Attachments - YouTube ]
Feb 29 08:12:27 <thanosapollon>	I've stopped taking notes complrtly but thats a nice video series 
Feb 29 08:15:46 <glenneth>	moshh: I've found the gule scheme course to be very good
Feb 29 08:18:25 <glenneth>	s/gule/guile
Feb 29 08:21:09 <thanosapollon>	Will there be a common lisp course daviwil ?
Feb 29 08:21:33 <BigEatie>	Yea, why isn't David teaching the superior lisp!?
Feb 29 08:21:45 <daviwil>	thanosapollon: It's possible, if there's enough demand.  I'd have to spend a bit of time refreshing my CL skills :)
Feb 29 08:21:52 <daviwil>	I'm happy to teach anything people want to learn
Feb 29 08:22:05 <BigEatie>	Lol, I was just trying to start a fight
Feb 29 08:22:29 <daviwil>	I have reached s-enlightenment, all Lisps are created equal :)
Feb 29 08:22:32 <moshh>	learning is good :)
Feb 29 08:26:37 <thanosapollon>	All lisps are awesome, I just want to hack on Nyxt tho 😂 
Feb 29 08:41:58 <glenneth>	thanosapollon: I'm hacking on Nyxt too :)
Feb 29 08:57:51 <trev>	if there is a CL course, be weary of Fade going undercover as a novice and trying to own the teacher
Feb 29 08:58:22 <alternateved>	Morning

Feb 29 09:21:11 <daviwil>	I'm going to sue you for copyright infringement
Feb 29 09:21:20 <daviwil>	I said that yesterday
Feb 29 09:26:28 <glenneth>	is nothing sacred? lol
Feb 29 09:27:01 <daviwil>	apparently not!
Feb 29 09:27:08 <glenneth>	:D
Feb 29 09:27:16 <daviwil>	btw, I sent you a message on the forum :)
Feb 29 09:28:33 <glenneth>	I shall take a look.  Is it my "must try harder" report card? 
Feb 29 09:28:50 <daviwil>	nope!
Feb 29 09:29:09 <daviwil>	I saw you using 'fold' in the code I looked at yesterday, you are trying harder than most :)
Feb 29 09:33:55 <glenneth>	reading the docs and it seemed to make sense when accumulatihg results
Feb 29 09:34:16 <daviwil>	yep, fold is excellent for that.  It's basically a swiss army knife for map/filter operations
Feb 29 09:37:57 <glenneth>	Appeared to be made to measure for that particular task.  And it didn't take too long to figure out its operation
Feb 29 09:38:13 <daviwil>	like I said, you're a natural!
Feb 29 09:39:11 <glenneth>	Read the manual :D
Feb 29 09:40:11 <glenneth>	I appreciate that though daviwil Thank you.  Means a lot
Feb 29 09:40:53 <glenneth>	I actually thought I would be a disaster
Feb 29 09:45:08 <daviwil>	instead of that you became a Scheme hacker
Feb 29 09:50:15 <trev>	and hyprland user
Feb 29 09:53:57 <glenneth>	I definitely feel like a hack :)
Feb 29 09:54:38 <glenneth>	All credit to you daviwil

Feb 29 09:58:39 <daviwil>	alternateved: maybe so :)
Feb 29 09:58:59 <alternateved>	Marvin2 is uncovering your secret schemes

Feb 29 10:04:11 <alternateved>	Haha :D
Feb 29 10:10:45 <glenneth>	re-writing GNU Stow in scheme :D  It's a start
Feb 29 10:12:16 <trev>	that would be actually good
Feb 29 10:12:18 <Marvin2>	that would be able to get people excited about coding and something we could collaborate on to brush up on the bouncer connection. Did you buy that?
Feb 29 10:12:25 <trev>	kill perl with fire
Feb 29 10:12:40 <glenneth>	can't call it stow though.  What about Scheme Stash?
Feb 29 10:12:52 <alternateved>	Great idea
Feb 29 10:13:10 <alternateved>	Please use Chicken for static binaries :D
Feb 29 10:13:33 <trev>	i think the stow devs were actually planning to get rid of the perl code
Feb 29 10:14:21 <alternateved>	Do you have a source?
Feb 29 10:18:56 <trev>	i think it was in that issue we have with steam alternateved 
Feb 29 10:19:05 <trev>	maybe i was just randomly clicking through their issues though
Feb 29 10:19:07 <Marvin2>	maybe i was just trying to debug erc
Feb 29 10:19:10 <alternateved>	Ah, I see
Feb 29 10:19:17 <trev>	i can find it in a bit, if it's not that issue on GH
Feb 29 10:19:17 <alternateved>	Were you trying to debug erc?
Feb 29 10:19:31 <alternateved>	Do you remember date by chance?
Feb 29 10:19:54 <alternateved>	I think rough date of that statement would be enough for me :D
Feb 29 10:26:18 <glenneth>	I have this already  https://0x0.st/HRwc.txt just changed stow to stash.  That's what We are going with :D

Feb 29 11:09:00 <glenneth>	aspiers is the maintainer of stow?
Feb 29 11:09:25 <alternateved>	Seems so
Feb 29 11:13:01 <glenneth>	So he has "a lot of experience with pytnon", thinks it should be re-written in python, but wants someone else to do it?  That sound about right?
Feb 29 11:13:03 <Marvin2>	So he has "a lot of people are lazy and selfish here
Feb 29 11:13:50 <glenneth>	Easy now Marvin2 , that's enough!

Feb 29 15:40:36 <nm0i>	I sometimes use epistonianmaid and mixstral, but those are heavy.

Feb 29 15:43:18 <nm0i>	sonya was a good generic purpose model as well... But really llms develop so quickly you should re-check "what is good" every two weeks or so.
Feb 29 15:45:17 <fyrfaras>	OIC, I have only scratched the surface of this whole topic. Maybe those fossy models will decrease my doubt or even disdain of LLMs :D
Feb 29 15:45:39 <nm0i>	You can just stick with the things ollama gives you.
Feb 29 15:45:55 <nm0i>	They curate a list of models.
Feb 29 15:52:58 <fyrfaras>	Are those models performance heavy?

Feb 29 19:09:48 <thanosapollon>	Lol, just read it on elfeed. Its funny seeing anyone mention yeetube 😂 glad that some find it useful like I do
Feb 29 19:09:58 <thanosapollon>	Did you try it tho?
Feb 29 19:19:22 <Keman99>	YeeTube sounds certainly interesting, I currently use a bash script for YouTube search and play in mpv ^^
Feb 29 19:21:51 <daviwil>	thanosapollon: nah I haven't tried it, I do all my YouTube watching on the phone 
Feb 29 19:22:05 <Fade>	ditto
Feb 29 19:23:11 <Fade>	overall, how do you guys value RSS support in an information source?
Feb 29 19:23:19 <Fade>	high, low, indifferent?
Feb 29 19:24:06 <thanosapollon>	I mostly use it to play & save music, lectures, podcasts etc. I first made it to download videos tho
Feb 29 19:24:14 <thanosapollon>	HIGH
Feb 29 19:24:32 <Fade>	i've been thinking about adding RSS support into Marvin's URL indexer
Feb 29 19:24:43 <thanosapollon>	I self host rss bridge and scrape everything I need
Feb 29 19:24:46 <Fade>	votes?
Feb 29 19:25:25 <Keman99>	RSS is always good :-)
Feb 29 19:25:33 <thanosapollon>	+1
Feb 29 19:26:17 <Fade>	All I remember about RSS is that it's some XML based format
Feb 29 19:26:24 <Fade>	so I've got some reading to do.
Feb 29 19:27:08 <thanosapollon>	You can also do it with json nowadays 
Feb 29 19:28:14 <Fade>	frankly, XML is probably simpler on the generation side
Feb 29 19:28:18 <Fade>	but I'll see what's what.

Feb 29 20:25:02 <morganw>	> <moshh> do people recommend running erc at startup, or manually calling the function?
Feb 29 20:25:02 <morganw>	One thing to bear in mind is that the directory you are in when calling an ERC connection function will become the default directory for ERC buffers, and that can accidentally put your ERC buffers in scope for commands like project-kill-buffers.
Feb 29 20:48:59 <trev>	BigEatie: is it flycheck?
Feb 29 20:52:49 <thanosapollo>	morganw I usually have a dedicated emacs for erc telega etc.  Why would you call erc on startup? 
Feb 29 20:52:52 <Marvin2>	morganw I usually have a direct need, I tend to like strong dynamic typing is very satisfying but it's a weird timing thing, on first emacs load, I have my tshirt and spring jacket. siping since Scotch while the fire is ready
Feb 29 21:00:14 <BigEatie>	trev: Don't think so, I didn't have it enabled. I think it's related to edebug, was running it earlier, but thought it should have gone away
Feb 29 21:01:00 <morganw>	thanosapollo: I guess because you either don't have a bouncer (and might want to run ERC in the Emacs daemon) or because you forget to connect it manually.

Mar 01 04:22:04 <Marvin2>	need to have the perception that it's around that time
Mar 01 04:22:31 <benoitj>	for ci/cd, let me send you a link
Mar 01 04:22:40 <benoitj>	you want your project build to use nix?
Mar 01 04:22:50 <benoitj>	I think my sr.ht build for my blog is using nix
Mar 01 04:22:55 <shom>	Need to start perceiving Marvin's triggers hahaha 
Mar 01 04:24:36 <benoitj>	my blog does have a shell.nix, but that is not my ci
Mar 01 04:24:38 <Marvin2>	my blog ci/cd
Mar 01 04:24:42 <shom>	Yeah, I also use sr.ht for my emacs - ox-hugo - Hugo - sr.ht pages deploy. I was using an alpine image but had to swap over to Ubuntu (heavy!) because I needed to hold back on emacs version. 
Mar 01 04:25:06 <benoitj>	it's using alpine right now, but I im pretty sure I had one
Mar 01 04:25:46 <shom>	Yeah, I want to pin versions so it doesn't unexpectedly break.

Mar 01 04:31:15 <talos>	I have a risc v board but I haven't gotten much use outta it 
Mar 01 04:31:32 <benoitj>	and build.sr.ht supports nix flakes
Mar 01 04:31:34 <benoitj>	it's in the doc

Mar 01 04:38:13 <benoitj>	show, now I want to update my hugo build with nix...
Mar 01 04:38:20 <benoitj>	it's using alpine right now

Mar 01 04:59:00 <shom>	Sorry I dropped out for a bit. Thanks for the link benoitj 
Mar 01 04:59:51 <shom>	Yeah, I want to go the flake route with build.sr.ht. Should be fun to play around!
Mar 01 05:01:07 <benoitj>	yeah :)
Mar 01 05:01:39 <shom>	talos: do you have an application in mind for your RISC-V board? Now that old x86 NUCs are so cheap and SBCs are so expensive, it's a really weird time for positioning low power devices. 
Mar 01 05:03:19 <benoitj>	shom: I think it works :P
Mar 01 05:04:01 <shom>	I have a whole fleet of NUCs that I bought at an auction with grand goals clustering but haven't gotten around to it. The power draw isn't too bad but my desktop CPU already has so many cores/threads 🤷🏽‍♂️ I'm sure I'll eventually find time to play around.

Mar 01 05:32:46 <glenneth>	Hi benoitj :)
Mar 01 05:33:14 <naokotani>	and it's pretty nice for migrations. it has a little CLI and run diesel migration redo -all and it will drop and recreate all of your tables in one go
Mar 01 05:34:30 <benoitj>	no... dont drop
Mar 01 05:34:35 <benoitj>	that is dangerous
Mar 01 05:34:45 <naokotani>	how so?
Mar 01 05:35:24 <benoitj>	you run this locally often enough, then you get used to it, you're ssh to your prod server, and you run this command until you found out you're not on you local
Mar 01 05:35:29 <benoitj>	worst nightmare
Mar 01 05:35:35 <naokotani>	yeah
Mar 01 05:35:37 <naokotani>	tbh
Mar 01 05:35:44 <naokotani>	that was going to be my next comment
Mar 01 05:35:50 <naokotani>	its great unitl yo udo it by accident
Mar 01 05:36:46 <naokotani>	I have actually been thinking about ways to elimate that
Mar 01 05:37:34 <benoitj>	if you need this for testing, then it's better to have that as part of your test suite setup which would never run with a real db
Mar 01 05:37:43 <benoitj>	at least this is one approach
Mar 01 05:38:17 <benoitj>	or you deploy postgres in a container with compose, and locally you compose down to delete the whole db
Mar 01 05:38:20 <naokotani>	well. the thing is it's run with migration files and if the drop tables don't exist int he production migration files then it won't do it
Mar 01 05:38:24 <benoitj>	and you dont use compose on the server
Mar 01 05:38:56 <benoitj>	you just woke up some trauma :D

Mar 01 06:19:07 <glenneth>	Should have tried sooner though.  Enjoying it so much
Mar 01 06:19:09 <Marvin2>	Should have said "borrowed" heh
Mar 01 06:20:13 <naokotani>	glenneth: This is me. I found out in my mid 30s that my favorite thing in the world is coding
Mar 01 06:20:27 <naokotani>	which is funny because I had always liked computer stuff, but I had never tried it
Mar 01 06:21:25 <naokotani>	I blame my mother for not threatening to disown me for doing an arts degree
Mar 01 06:21:44 <cow_2001>	can you draw?!
Mar 01 06:21:58 <trev>	glenneth: you had to put down the abacus first
Mar 01 06:21:59 <glenneth>	You can add 20 years to that statement naokotani :D
Mar 01 06:22:22 <glenneth>	That's true trev lol
Mar 01 06:22:22 <naokotani>	glenneth: ok now I feel a lot better
Mar 01 06:22:51 <cow_2001>	trev: have you seen the japanese using abacuses?  they become calculators
Mar 01 06:23:07 <naokotani>	aren't the originally for China?
Mar 01 06:23:11 <cow_2001>	trev: they don't even need it
Mar 01 06:23:15 <naokotani>	from*
Mar 01 06:23:26 <glenneth>	haha.  Glad I couid make you feel better.  Already a good day :)
Mar 01 06:24:00 <trev>	cow_2001: no but i can imagine. they always master everything
Mar 01 06:24:04 <cow_2001>	naokotani: the chinese ones have extra beads for hexa based measures or somesuch
Mar 01 06:24:27 <naokotani>	apparnelty they were found earlier in west asia it seems
Mar 01 06:24:41 <cow_2001>	trev: it's just a matter of spending your evenings at an after school course without socialisation.  no biggie!
Mar 01 06:24:44 <Marvin2>	trev: it's just fair to get off the romans tbh
Mar 01 06:24:49 <trev>	lol
Mar 01 06:25:51 <glenneth>	didn't they use base12 or was that the Babylonians?
Mar 01 06:26:13 <naokotani>	base 60 appanretly
Mar 01 06:26:21 <glenneth>	brb - coffee
Mar 01 06:26:27 <naokotani>	the sumerians, and by extesion likely the babylonians
Mar 01 06:26:52 <BigEatie>	David made it look easy, but this whole creating a website thing in pure org is a lot harder than I thought it would be.
Mar 01 06:27:17 <cow_2001>	just use dthompson's haunt ~_~
Mar 01 06:27:20 <naokotani>	I was too lazy and just made a noder server for my org website
Mar 01 06:28:18 <naokotani>	that reminds me
Mar 01 06:28:23 <cow_2001>	i think there's a new version of haunt
Mar 01 06:28:36 <BigEatie>	Don't know scheme lol
Mar 01 06:28:42 <naokotani>	that reminds me. I had inteded to make something to turn the org html into proper html5
Mar 01 06:29:01 <BigEatie>	This is a good exercise in doing some pragmatic elisp, but I'm not sure this will be a usable site. Might try something like ox-hugo

Mar 01 06:30:15 <naokotani>	check out how I did it. i am pretty happy with it
Mar 01 06:30:37 <naokotani>	I just export the body and then use javascript for the rest
Mar 01 06:30:52 <naokotani>	turns out javascript is pretty good website stuff
Mar 01 06:30:58 <glenneth>	Hey BigEatie o/
Mar 01 06:31:01 <naokotani>	good for*
Mar 01 06:31:30 <naokotani>	I would like to add something to add images though
Mar 01 06:32:13 <glenneth>	I can highly recommend daviwil Scheme course BigEatie :)
Mar 01 06:33:32 <daviwil>	BigEatie: it is pretty tricky to be honest, the SC site is the result of a lot of experimentation and refinement and it's still kinda janky :) 
Mar 01 06:33:52 <daviwil>	But I'm pretty happy with it, I've reproduced the model across a few sites now
Mar 01 06:34:51 <glenneth>	daviwil: is the Candyman.  Speak his name and he appears :D
Mar 01 06:35:37 <daviwil>	Hey, when I see my name while I'm eating Corn Flakes, I can use a good distraction :) 
Mar 01 06:35:39 <Marvin2>	Hey, when I was defeated when they got here it was like a playoff game.
Mar 01 06:36:06 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 01 06:36:13 <naokotani>	wait, no froasted flakes? what are you a monk?
Mar 01 06:36:17 *	daviwil smacks Marvin2 with a printed copy of the Lisp HyperSpec
Mar 01 06:36:43 <glenneth>	That's gotta hurt!
Mar 01 06:36:59 *	naokotani smacks daviwil with a box of count chocula

Mar 01 06:37:23 <daviwil>	Sugar for breakfast? No thanks! 
Mar 01 06:38:35 <naokotani>	gives you that little boost you need to get productive on answering emails straight away after breakfast
Mar 01 06:39:26 <BigEatie>	Not sure if there's a more idiomatic way to get around the cross-project linking issue, this is probably a pretty cavemanish way to do it, but it seems to work: https://0x0.st/HRDp.txt

Mar 01 06:45:45 <trev>	the next one is still beginner right?

Mar 01 07:34:51 <shom>	Yay, glad I could help daviwil! 
Mar 01 07:34:53 <daviwil>	It'll be free for the community
Mar 01 07:35:49 <shom>	daviwil: a full sourcehut stack for System Crafters or the bouncer? 
Mar 01 07:36:06 <daviwil>	nah, just the bouncer
Mar 01 07:36:35 <daviwil>	though I am seeing the value of having some kind of Git forge, especially for course work
Mar 01 07:36:37 <Marvin2>	though I don't use it though.
Mar 01 07:36:44 <daviwil>	tell us more, Marvin
Mar 01 07:39:01 <shom>	daviwil: when forgejo has federation working, I think that would be cool to host for System Crafters for things like crafted emacs, etc. 
Mar 01 07:39:03 <Marvin2>	daviwil: when forgejo has federation working, I think that's me, but my desktop CPU already has so many wonderful southern folks over the world
Mar 01 07:39:20 <shom>	Not saying it's necessary, just fun
Mar 01 07:39:26 <daviwil>	yeah, it could be fun
Mar 01 07:39:50 <shom>	Hahaha southern folks in CPUs
Mar 01 07:40:20 <glenneth>	Is that CPU drawl? lol

Mar 01 07:41:59 <shom>	Y'all spinning threads about them CPUs down there? 
Mar 01 07:42:08 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 01 07:43:26 <daviwil>	I can just hear that in my head
Mar 01 07:48:10 <trev>	are you from the south shom?
Mar 01 07:49:59 <shom>	No, I live in central Illinois USA, we're almost the south around here. I also spent a good bit of time working with clients in Kentucky. How about you? 
Mar 01 07:50:43 <trev>	i'm from CT
Mar 01 07:51:36 <daviwil>	I grew up in Mississippi so I think I can safely claim to be the most southern
Mar 01 07:51:50 <trev>	jackson?
Mar 01 07:52:09 <daviwil>	nah, Jackson is too civilized to be where I grew up
Mar 01 07:52:18 <trev>	biloxi blues
Mar 01 07:52:52 <daviwil>	small town in northeast MS near Columbus
Mar 01 07:53:23 <trev>	i just watched a video on the poorest parts of MS
Mar 01 07:53:50 <daviwil>	plenty of those
Mar 01 07:54:10 <daviwil>	plenty of poor places in MS, I mean
Mar 01 07:54:12 <Marvin2>	plenty of poor places in MS, I mean get it working benoitj 👏🏽
Mar 01 07:54:22 <BigEatie>	Houston Tx!
Mar 01 07:54:43 <daviwil>	Texas is pretty cool
Mar 01 07:55:10 <daviwil>	I've only been to DFW area though
Mar 01 07:55:36 <BigEatie>	Yea, I miss it -- I think we're further south than Jackson (though not sure if Tx is part of "the south")
Mar 01 07:56:09 <daviwil>	Texas is the California of the south
Mar 01 07:56:25 <daviwil>	meaning, it has its own culture
Mar 01 07:56:35 <daviwil>	California is west coast, but only California is California
Mar 01 07:56:45 <BigEatie>	Fair enough

Mar 01 07:59:58 <BigEatie>	Thanks
Mar 01 08:00:32 <BigEatie>	Yea, I think I'm at that age where the question-mark is more appropriate than the exclamation haha
Mar 01 08:01:15 <daviwil>	I just turned 41 so you've still got some time left to feel young ;)

Mar 01 08:03:36 <BigEatie>	Oh I definitely still feel young daviwil, my soul is still 15. But my teenager will let me know I'm old whenever she can lol
Mar 01 08:11:38 <daviwil>	shom: I pulled something in my back yesterday while sitting in a chair and it still hurts 
Mar 01 08:11:53 <daviwil>	I also dislocated my shoulder while sleeping earlier this week 
Mar 01 08:11:55 <daviwil>	Fun times! 
Mar 01 08:13:43 <shom>	Woah dislocated in sleep!!! I have new fears now. No wonder I'm procrastinating on sleeping. 
Mar 01 08:14:09 <daviwil>	My shoulder gets dislocated like once or twice a year so I can't lame that one on being 41
Mar 01 08:14:12 <Marvin2>	My shoulder while sleeping earlier this week

Mar 01 08:46:00 <glenneth>	hey alternateved 
Mar 01 08:47:44 <naokotani>	After working at IRL jobs for 20 years 25 yeras on a computer sounds great to me
Mar 01 08:48:09 <naokotani>	though im sure after 6 months ill be ready to smash my computer into a billion pieces
Mar 01 08:49:20 <trev>	hobbyist computing is awesome. i
Mar 01 08:49:48 <trev>	i would sit here for 25 years if i didn't have to "work"
Mar 01 08:50:39 <glenneth>	Guys.  Sell me on evil mode.
Mar 01 08:51:20 <naokotani>	Perhpas working is the heart of the issue then
Mar 01 08:51:27 <trev>	you already use it glenneth 
Mar 01 08:51:49 <naokotani>	The only thing worse than working is not working
Mar 01 08:52:04 <naokotani>	if I didn't have to work id lose touch with reality
Mar 01 08:53:18 <glenneth>	No.  I tried the crafted emacs evil config but it borked my mu4e config
Mar 01 08:54:04 <trev>	oh wow i thought you resolved that
Mar 01 08:54:25 <naokotani>	I had a long work vacation and my wife and son went away for a while to Ontario and I was like what to do today... I know! same as yesterday. I will play diablo 2 for 12 hours
Mar 01 08:54:30 <glenneth>	I did manually apply a fix, when i restarted emacs it was still broken
Mar 01 08:55:37 <naokotani>	If I had an ounce of self respect id use mu4e again. I just use the browser app
Mar 01 08:56:06 <glenneth>	I didn't really understand the code at the time, but now I know a little bit more, thought I would try again
Mar 01 08:56:13 <naokotani>	the problem with the browser app is it does everything I need and works quite well
Mar 01 08:56:17 <Marvin2>	the problem with the integrated shells, but did anyone come? Did they told us to handle a unit test for functions that insert into a pastebin?
Mar 01 08:56:29 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 01 08:56:52 <naokotani>	oh no! not unit tests for functions that insert into a pastebin!
Mar 01 08:56:56 <naokotani>	those are the hardest to test
Mar 01 08:56:57 <glenneth>	Marvin2: on the mushrooms again
Mar 01 08:57:46 <naokotani>	The reason I like Marvin2 is he is like fun house mirror reflection of my own stupidity
Mar 01 08:59:42 <naokotani>	wait
Mar 01 08:59:43 <trev>	glenneth: i just spent a few weeks using emacs bindings. they are fine once i adjusted a few things to act more like vim (ex. jumping words). i think if i stuck with it i would have no problem
Mar 01 09:00:18 <naokotani>	with those apple vision glasses would I be able to have my emacs on them so I don't need to use a crappy laptop screen
Mar 01 09:01:51 <trev>	naokotani: you feeling ill?
Mar 01 09:01:58 <glenneth>	I used doom emacs for a long time so really had no choice, really paid no attention TBH.  Using vanilla bindings rn 
Mar 01 09:03:11 <trev>	glenneth: i could imagine that regular emacs bindings are better for writing, where vim may be better for editing code
Mar 01 09:03:22 <alternateved>	Vanilla bindings are okay if you are using ergonomic keyboard
Mar 01 09:03:33 <glenneth>	trev: stop him now!!! He's getting apple fever
Mar 01 09:04:34 <glenneth>	thanks folx
Mar 01 09:04:58 <trev>	oh yeah if you have multiple layers on your keyboard you could probably make a nice layout
Mar 01 09:06:09 <alternateved>	Homerow mods made a huge difference for me
Mar 01 09:07:44 <naokotani>	trev: just brain storming
Mar 01 09:08:58 <naokotani>	I think the main reason vim keybinds are good is how widely available vim mods are for many things
Mar 01 09:09:01 <trev>	probably costs more than a laptop with a decent screen
Mar 01 09:09:08 <naokotani>	pretty much every code editor, browsers, you name it
Mar 01 09:09:36 <naokotani>	not to mention vim is standard on most systems so you have a viable way to edit text everywhere
Mar 01 09:10:45 <naokotani>	its practically a text editing specification really
Mar 01 09:18:43 <glenneth>	isn't the vision pro like 3500 USD?
Mar 01 09:20:52 <naokotani>	for now yeah, im sure it will come downt to like 2000 USD in no time
Mar 01 09:33:26 <trev>	could get an insane computer for that much
Mar 01 09:33:29 <Marvin2>	could get an Akai MPK Mini lately, didn't get to the collection.
Mar 01 09:37:32 <naokotani>	speaking of which, I need an insane computer
Mar 01 09:37:44 <naokotani>	mine is such a hodge podge of random parts
Mar 01 09:38:05 <naokotani>	it keeps randomly freezing and idk if its the hardware or windows
Mar 01 09:39:59 <trev>	could be from all the anime you keep downloading
Mar 01 09:42:19 <naokotani>	I have no idea. I look through the event logs and there are no errors I can find causing it
Mar 01 09:42:59 <naokotani>	but there seems to be a correlation with some changes to microsoft gameinput, which is some kind of intentional virus youc an't remove
Mar 01 10:02:20 <alternateved>	Try pronouncing M-x out loud.
Mar 01 10:02:49 <vii_majesty>	emacs?

Mar 01 11:38:26 <alternateved>	My wrists hurt when using non-split keyboards
Mar 01 11:40:12 <alternateved>	I honestly don't see a point in using non-split/staggered/unibody keyboards for my use case

Mar 01 11:40:58 <alternateved>	Marvin2: we all do
Mar 01 11:41:33 <alternateved>	trev: I prefer split keyboards with thumb clusters
Mar 01 11:41:48 <alternateved>	You could experiment with combos 
Mar 01 11:41:57 <trev>	i think that will be my next journey 
Mar 01 11:42:14 <theesm>	Good morning folks 
Mar 01 11:42:17 <alternateved>	I also don't like having keys like enter, backspace, escape etc. on outer columns
Mar 01 11:42:29 <alternateved>	this is one of the reasons why my wrists hurt

Mar 01 11:43:10 <trev>	hi theesm 
Mar 01 11:43:47 <trev>	i dont usually have wrist pain. i do the thumb thing to reach win/alt and that causes me pain
Mar 01 11:44:57 <trev>	on my new board i moved them towards the center so i don't have to reach so far
Mar 01 11:45:31 <alternateved>	I have mods on homerow, so no reaching for me :D
Mar 01 11:45:49 <alternateved>	trev: I have, unfortunately. That's why I use split boards with tenting
Mar 01 11:48:10 <trev>	does that mean you use tap/hold for those home keys?
Mar 01 11:48:12 <Marvin2>	does that mean you use in intellij and vscode

Mar 01 12:20:20 <alternateved>	Month, maybe? Maybe more to truly get comfortable with that
Mar 01 12:20:22 <Marvin2>	Month, maybe? Maybe more to truly get comfortable with them on much
Mar 01 12:20:46 <alternateved>	The problem with homerow mods is that you have to relearn how to type unfortunetely
Mar 01 12:20:48 <Marvin2>	The problem with the things ollama gives you.
Mar 01 12:21:02 <alternateved>	Marvin2 please, let me finish
Mar 01 12:21:45 <alternateved>	So you have to type with swift taps otherwise your input might be interpreted as hold functionality
Mar 01 12:22:13 <alternateved>	also, there is a time period where you tweak your tapping term and other configurations etc. 
Mar 01 12:22:56 <alternateved>	For ZMK there is a config which proposes timerless homerow configuration: https://github.com/urob/zmk-config?tab=readme-ov-file#timeless-homerow-mods
Mar 01 12:22:59 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/CxwFS ]::[ GitHub - urob/zmk-config: Personal ZMK firmware configuration for various boards (34-keys, Corneish Zen, Planck) ]
Mar 01 12:23:22 <alternateved>	But I noticed that it doesn't work well with Emacs as modifiers are often chained
Mar 01 12:23:47 <trev>	i am using qmk
Mar 01 12:24:10 <alternateved>	For QMK there is this configuration: https://sunaku.github.io/home-row-mods.html
Mar 01 12:24:12 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/kTJDM ]::[ Taming home row mods with bilateral combinations - The Terminal Programmer ]
Mar 01 12:24:18 <trev>	that's pretty interesting. i don't type well in general, so i think i would have a hard time with it
Mar 01 12:24:25 <alternateved>	it pretty much should do the same thing
Mar 01 12:24:27 <trev>	thanks i'
Mar 01 12:24:33 <trev>	i will take a look
Mar 01 12:24:39 <alternateved>	I also don't type well
Mar 01 12:25:41 <alternateved>	I'm a slow typer, I've learned to touch type pretty late in my life
Mar 01 12:57:57 <trev>	reading that blog, some people are really interested in typing! giant flow chart on there lol
Mar 01 13:00:33 <alternateved>	Haha, you bet

Mar 01 14:22:38 <benoitj>	morning
Mar 01 14:22:45 <daviwil>	hey benoitj
Mar 01 14:22:58 <benoitj>	 hi daviwil 
Mar 01 14:26:28 <benoitj>	need coffee
Mar 01 14:26:30 <nm0i>	Morning
Mar 01 14:27:05 <benoitj>	hi nm0i 
Mar 01 14:32:28 <benoitj>	26 seconds to my coffee
Mar 01 14:35:39 <trev>	i need more thank coffee right now
Mar 01 14:35:42 <Marvin2>	i need to call out my job like that with rust too
Mar 01 14:38:21 <benoitj>	trev: two coffee? i'm having a double shot espresso :P
Mar 01 14:40:49 <daviwil>	Discourse API is annoying
Mar 01 14:41:12 <daviwil>	apparently you can't send an invite to someone to join a forum group if they're already a member of the forum
Mar 01 14:41:27 <benoitj>	oh
Mar 01 14:41:34 <daviwil>	so I've gotta catch this case, look up the group, look up the user, add the user to the group, then send them an invite directly to the topic where I want them to land
Mar 01 14:41:52 <daviwil>	too many extra steps just because their API doesn't let me say "invite them anyway"
Mar 01 14:42:27 <daviwil>	someone registered for the course and the invite webhook didn't work for some reason, and this turned out to be the reason!
Mar 01 14:42:41 <benoitj>	ah
Mar 01 14:42:47 <benoitj>	sounds like fun :)
Mar 01 14:43:00 <daviwil>	yeah, not exactly how I wanted to spend my afternoon, but I want this to work :)
Mar 01 14:43:03 <benoitj>	some APIs dont make much sense
Mar 01 14:43:30 <benoitj>	this is missing a facade API, to abstract some common use cases like this
Mar 01 14:44:18 <daviwil>	Looks like I'll have to implement my own invite logic and send an e-mail my own way
Mar 01 14:44:19 <benoitj>	but it does make sense to build a REST API this way
Mar 01 14:44:53 <benoitj>	resource driven, there is no such thing as actions "invite or add to group"
Mar 01 14:45:02 <daviwil>	yeah
Mar 01 15:07:31 <talos>	Good day Crafters

Mar 01 19:04:31 <benoitj>	I could not attend anyway, but I did not even realize there was one
Mar 01 19:04:45 <benoitj>	minimal writing environment. finished 1 minute ago
Mar 01 19:05:51 <beanpuck>	i caught the last 30 seconds where he mentioned this server :D
Mar 01 19:06:26 <benoitj>	I probably could xonotic tonight
Mar 01 19:08:21 <naokotani>	trev: I finally got a job interview
Mar 01 19:08:49 <trev>	naokotani: awesome!
Mar 01 19:09:17 <naokotani>	Yeah fingers crossed
Mar 01 19:09:24 <naokotani>	"lamp" stack stuff
Mar 01 19:10:29 <naokotani>	I guess I was able to make the case that my lnps stack is close enough
Mar 01 19:10:31 <Marvin2>	I guess I was switching buffers but they started a dedicated emacs for erc telega etc. Why would you call erc on startup?
Mar 01 19:12:53 <benoitj>	naokotani: congrats
Mar 01 19:14:02 <Fade>	naokotani: good luck!
Mar 01 19:17:22 <shom>	Welcome beanpuck 
Mar 01 19:17:31 <beanpuck>	o/
Mar 01 19:17:40 <trev>	LAMP stack is oldskool
Mar 01 19:18:07 <shom>	Congrats naokotani what's the position responsible for? 
Mar 01 19:18:07 <Fade>	oldskool is bestskool.
Mar 01 19:18:09 <dazage>	LAMP is the bee's knees
Mar 01 19:18:21 <beanpuck>	tried and true
Mar 01 19:18:43 <benoitj>	beanpuck: welcome
Mar 01 19:18:47 <shom>	LAMP is how I got properly comfortable with Linux, I think. 
Mar 01 19:18:49 <Marvin2>	LAMP is the default)
Mar 01 19:19:22 <shom>	hahaha I don't like that Marvin2 is starting to make sense. 
Mar 01 19:19:43 <Fade>	it's good for you.
Mar 01 19:19:49 <Fade>	(just go with it)
Mar 01 19:19:51 <dazage>	Linux Nginx NOSQL NodeJS -> LNNN
Mar 01 19:20:04 <Fade>	nosql :((
Mar 01 19:20:07 <dazage>	replace Linux with Nutanix and you got yourself a 4N stack
Mar 01 19:20:20 <Fade>	also, node
Mar 01 19:20:23 <shom>	Fade: not a complaint, uncanny valley here we come! 
Mar 01 19:20:51 <Fade>	(throw 'abstraction-boundary-violation-error)
Mar 01 19:20:56 <benoitj>	Fade: about your clojure vector comments. not really. what they built is all collections implement the Collection java interface, and they have a Seq constructor which is a "protocol" that implements first, rest, and cons, the core type of features of lisp lists
Mar 01 19:21:19 <benoitj>	so instead of storing everything in cons cells, everything expose something that looks like cons cells
Mar 01 19:21:20 <Fade>	ah, k. I knew there was nuance that I wasn't converying. thanks!
Mar 01 19:21:49 <benoitj>	you can effectively play with everything, including maps, as "cons cells" using the seq protocol.
Mar 01 19:21:52 <Fade>	s/eryi/eyi
Mar 01 19:22:39 <benoitj>	also all functional collection manipulation high order functions play with seqs, so map, reduce, filter, etc. are implemented once for all data structures, even ones not yet implemented or invented
Mar 01 19:22:40 <Fade>	does clojure have car and cdr and the extensions to them?
Mar 01 19:22:57 <benoitj>	first and rest is the equivalent
Mar 01 19:23:18 <Fade>	(cadar 'my-deep-seq)
Mar 01 19:23:24 <benoitj>	(first '(1 2 3))
Mar 01 19:23:26 <benoitj>	this is 1
Mar 01 19:23:39 <benoitj>	cadar, not sure what it does
Mar 01 19:23:40 <Fade>	sure. cl has these synonyms, too.
Mar 01 19:23:44 <naokotani>	yeah ive been dong linix nginx postres and react/svelte/rust/node/htmx in the last few months
Mar 01 19:23:46 <Marvin2>	yeah ive been dong linix nginx postres and react/svelte/rust/node/htmx in the series Raft, has a decent numbe rof poele that speak gaelic here
Mar 01 19:24:19 <trev>	dong linix??
Mar 01 19:24:28 <naokotani>	Linux
Mar 01 19:24:30 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 01 19:24:38 <benoitj>	Fade: in clojure, these are the car / cdr
Mar 01 19:24:43 <Fade>	the car/cdr features in CL can be extended by addint 'a and 'd between the c and the r in the functions.
Mar 01 19:24:52 <Fade>	they're all discreet, but they're specified in the standard.
Mar 01 19:24:56 <naokotani>	I know nginx can serve php, but I havne't really delved into that too deeply (or at all)
Mar 01 19:25:01 <Fade>	this might not even make sense in clojure.
Mar 01 19:25:24 <benoitj>	yeah, since they rely on an abstraction of seq, they dont need extension
Mar 01 19:25:36 <benoitj>	no polymorphic trick needed
Mar 01 19:25:42 <trev>	david said clojure isn't real during the stream
Mar 01 19:25:42 <Fade>	sounds like operations on large lists might be N+1
Mar 01 19:25:52 <naokotani>	Currently reading about it as paw patrol blasts in my face because appanretly every day is now a snow day
Mar 01 19:26:02 <saboto>	cloujure can't use tail-call optmization, because the JVM doesn't support it
Mar 01 19:26:15 <Fade>	I vew clojure as a 'real' lisp that is in fact a subset of common lisp.
Mar 01 19:26:22 <benoitj>	Fade: the O notation performance are in the same order as their non-persistent implementations
Mar 01 19:26:29 <Fade>	its implementation is unorthodox due to the runtime it was built on.
Mar 01 19:26:42 <Fade>	benoitj: *nod*
Mar 01 19:26:53 <benoitj>	yeah, but also, because they rely on the seq abstraction, it makes a lot of stuff so nice
Mar 01 19:27:56 <benoitj>	to more I discuss with you, I think clojure has fixed immutability, some of the concurency and data structure challenges, while introduced some complexity by depending on a hosted runtime
Mar 01 19:28:29 <benoitj>	** challenges of CL
Mar 01 19:29:22 <Fade>	rich really went to town on the immutable datastructures
Mar 01 19:29:23 <benoitj>	for example, if you want to convert a string to an integer, you have to call the java function (Integer/parseInt "123")
Mar 01 19:29:29 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 01 19:29:31 <Fade>	software transactional memory was inspired.
Mar 01 19:29:37 <benoitj>	ok
Mar 01 19:29:47 <Fade>	by which I mean a brilliant idea.
Mar 01 19:30:12 <benoitj>	another big advantage, it can be made invisible in a corporate environment. this can be launched from a java app :P
Mar 01 19:30:32 <benoitj>	my next "java" rules engine might actually be written in clojure

Mar 02 04:31:14 <benoitj>	they sent you another invite?
Mar 02 04:33:24 <naokotani>	yes. I waited and then I got a call and he gave some long winded explanation about something came up important to his business
Mar 02 04:34:03 <benoitj>	that could happen
Mar 02 04:34:06 <Marvin2>	that could be done.
Mar 02 04:34:09 <benoitj>	they called you
Mar 02 04:34:44 <naokotani>	Yeah, shit happens.
Mar 02 04:36:00 <trev>	naokotani: no worries, just keep applying
Mar 02 04:36:52 <naokotani>	yeah I am going to apply to another one tonoght. that is based in my local city. jr developer for mongo/node/react stuff
Mar 02 04:37:38 <glenneth>	I'm doing OK thanks benoitj :)

Mar 02 04:41:31 <glenneth>	all good naokotani Sorry to hear about your interview
Mar 02 04:42:08 <naokotani>	I am sure I will find something eventually. The issue with jobs is mostly hte anxiety related to feeding my family
Mar 02 04:42:10 <Marvin2>	I am clearly doing something wrong but I assume that requires a c compiler? idk
Mar 02 04:44:20 <glenneth>	I'm sure you will too.  
Mar 02 04:54:46 <naokotani>	So what scheme projects do you have in mind?
Mar 02 04:54:49 <Marvin2>	So what scheme projects do you like man in the end. Oh, how I long for it"
Mar 02 05:27:38 <naokotani>	I can't believe the added nothing to d2r seasons 6
Mar 02 05:27:41 <naokotani>	two seasons in a row
Mar 02 05:27:57 <naokotani>	I guess people are supposed to play the flaming pile of junk diablo 4
Mar 02 05:32:58 <glenneth>	Sorry naokotani Was on a call.  Me? Scheme projects?
Mar 02 05:33:06 <glenneth>	d2r?
Mar 02 05:34:28 <naokotani>	Aren't you taking the scheme course?
Mar 02 05:34:45 <naokotani>	d2r is diablo 2: resurrected. its a remake of a popular game from around 2000
Mar 02 05:35:35 <glenneth>	Yeah.  Was the final week last week.  Still working on the final exercises.
Mar 02 05:36:49 <naokotani>	Thought you might have some ideas for stuff you wanted to build with it
Mar 02 05:37:09 <glenneth>	I have it in mind to write a scheme version of GNU Stow
Mar 02 05:39:05 <glenneth>	Call it Scheme Stash :)
Mar 02 05:39:38 <naokotani>	man
Mar 02 05:39:47 <naokotani>	funny, IW as trying to remember what stow was called the other day
Mar 02 05:40:02 <naokotani>	I use it for my dotfiles and I haven't updated them in ages

Mar 02 05:58:55 <BigEatie>	Most of the themes I see don't seem to support ERC

Mar 02 06:01:20 <Marvin2>	hey BigEatie o/
Mar 02 06:04:14 <BigEatie>	Yea, doom is one of the nice packages that covers ERC.
Mar 02 06:07:33 <naokotani>	You know I am a fiend when I decide its time to take a break from work and that's messing with prot packags
Mar 02 06:09:27 <glenneth>	lol

Mar 02 06:17:12 <naokotani>	I liked one of the themes I saw daviwil scroll past on stream today
Mar 02 06:22:24 <glenneth>	the ef themes?
Mar 02 06:23:19 <naokotani>	yeah
Mar 02 06:23:26 <naokotani>	I've been using modus for a year or so
Mar 02 06:23:37 <naokotani>	been feeling like chaning it but nothing caught my eye
Mar 02 06:23:56 <naokotani>	the problem with modus themes is they are very easy to read
Mar 02 06:23:58 <Marvin2>	the problem is reuse, you find a javascript developer who is trevin? :D
Mar 02 06:24:23 <naokotani>	its lke
Mar 02 06:24:33 <glenneth>	I used the dark spacemacs theme for a while.  Quite iliked it 
Mar 02 06:24:42 <naokotani>	ok. I need a theme that looks nice AND goes well with my ghost in the shell backgrounds
Mar 02 06:26:09 <naokotani>	oh yeaht aht looks pretty cool
Mar 02 06:32:22 <trev>	hahah marvin greets now!!
Mar 02 07:13:47 <trev>	glenneth: how's it going? doing some scheme or stuck doing real work?
Mar 02 07:18:40 <naokotani>	He is going to make a scheme version of gnu stow
Mar 02 07:24:13 <trev>	all in one weekend?
Mar 02 07:26:33 <naokotani>	pretty sure that's his plan yeah
Mar 02 07:27:30 <naokotani>	I think next weekend he is going to rewrite the GCC compiler in Scheme so he needs to get Stow out of the way this weekend
Mar 02 07:28:46 <trev>	dang i wish i had goals
Mar 02 07:28:48 <BigEatie>	Who are we talking about?
Mar 02 07:29:11 <trev>	you, BigEatie 
Mar 02 07:30:04 <daviwil>	Big goal! 
Mar 02 07:30:08 <naokotani>	BigEatie: Don't listen to him, we are talking about glenneth 
Mar 02 07:31:51 <naokotani>	This job requires familiarity with Mac
Mar 02 07:32:02 <naokotani>	what does that entail? click on teh picture of this thing you want to do?
Mar 02 07:32:28 <glenneth>	Hi trev *REAL* work unfortunately
Mar 02 07:33:09 <naokotani>	Speaking of real work, I was talking to my wife the other day how we really need to find a crab/lobster boat this summer
Mar 02 07:33:23 <naokotani>	they rake in some seroius dough
Mar 02 07:33:58 <naokotani>	Maybe if I do crab and lobster fishing I can fund my software develoopment habit
Mar 02 07:34:12 <glenneth>	Sureiy they are easy to find.  Large floaty things that live on water
Mar 02 07:34:15 <Marvin2>	Sureiy they are very easy to read widely and make it hard to

Mar 02 08:54:36 <naokotani>	oh I figured out why they are using a static &str here. so obvious
Mar 02 08:55:07 <naokotani>	its because its going straight into the database so theres no reason it needs to be mutable
Mar 02 09:35:26 <trev>	naokotani: who is doing that? it's usually because they will handle the copying underneath the api level 
Mar 02 09:35:28 <Marvin2>	naokotani: who is trevin? :D

Mar 02 09:37:47 <trev>	naokotani: don't forget that 'static is not always the entire life of the program. the compiler can find a way to verify that the lifetime is "long enough"

Mar 02 11:51:43 *	mretka is watching yesterday's stream
Mar 02 11:52:17 <glenneth>	cool.  Just reading it now.  Interesting
Mar 02 11:52:49 <mretka>	Lately I'm munching on the idea of having an Emacs instance as a disposable scratchpad on my computer, it's proving to be quite useful at work
Mar 02 11:53:54 <mretka>	I like having a scratchpad (a digital notepad) around to toss whatever is in my head at work at the moment or copy/paste code
Mar 02 11:54:21 <mretka>	That idea came from here: https://tot.rocks/, and here: https://daringfireball.net/2020/02/tot
Mar 02 11:54:24 <Marvin2>	[ https://tot.rocks/, ]::[ Couldn't fetch this page. ]
Mar 02 11:54:26 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/DVMuC ]::[ Daring Fireball: Tot ]
Mar 02 11:56:49 <mretka>	The trick is to keep that scratchpad window on top of all the others and make some space for it in the screen's real estate.I think that would work better with tiling window managers
Mar 02 11:56:52 <Marvin2>	The trick is to learn ansible.
Mar 02 12:04:42 <glenneth>	Apologies mretka I had to take a call.  You use an emacsclient as your scratchpad?
Mar 02 12:04:57 <glenneth>	Need coffee, brb
Mar 02 12:08:03 <trev>	nm0i: hahah did you ask AI about this chat?
Mar 02 12:08:25 <nm0i>	I use summarize prompt in ellama
Mar 02 12:09:26 <trev>	it didn't mention me?
Mar 02 12:09:30 <trev>	that hurts 
Mar 02 12:09:49 <nm0i>	It still insists you don't exists, but there is someone called trevin.
Mar 02 12:19:40 <naokotani>	trev: its the suggested code for this ORM
Mar 02 12:20:18 <naokotani>	its not actually static. It's its &'a &str where a is the struct
Mar 02 12:20:51 <naokotani>	so I build the struct, enter it one for one into the database and then the struct goes out of scope
Mar 02 12:22:03 <naokotani>	then I have a seperate struct that is used when the data comes out, but it uses Strings and inlcudes the table primary key
Mar 02 12:22:07 <Marvin2>	then I have no idea Rust Rover was a hard-realtime application. I doubt clojure could have used an additional three weeks ago. Deadline is Next Tuesday. We could collaborate on to brush up on Emacs version.
Mar 02 12:23:49 <naokotani>	I'm not entirely sure why, but my guess is it can be allocated to the stack this way
Mar 02 12:25:32 <trev>	naokotani: yeah it's coming from io so it can't be a reference 
Mar 02 12:27:14 <naokotani>	On the way out?
Mar 02 12:27:44 <naokotani>	Now. the question is.... if I have to serialize json to get these values, can I use a reference
Mar 02 12:28:03 <naokotani>	I guess I'd have to look at all the serde stuff
Mar 02 12:28:47 <naokotani>	I guess it makes sense that it can be a reference to the json. 
Mar 02 12:29:32 <naokotani>	or the query string perhaps, anyway some form of http plain text
Mar 02 12:29:36 <trev>	naokotani: short answer is "no"
Mar 02 12:29:43 <trev>	needs to be owned when deserviali
Mar 02 12:29:48 <trev>	deserializing
Mar 02 12:30:08 <trev>	still not used to my new keyboard 😞
Mar 02 12:31:20 <naokotani>	yeah because I guess if it were a reference to the http plain text it would rely on the life time of the json itself
Mar 02 12:32:03 <mretka>	glenneth: No, I actually bring up another Emacs instance rather than emacsclient
Mar 02 12:32:18 <mretka>	It makes it easier to separate frames and switch to them IMO
Mar 02 12:33:11 <naokotani>	hmmm. I think this is probably more work than its worth to copy a handful of strings
Mar 02 12:33:20 <naokotani>	to avoid copy*
Mar 02 12:43:16 <naokotani>	Now that I think about it, another short answer is could be if it doesn't know how long it needs to be at compile time, it needs to be a String
Mar 02 12:44:00 <naokotani>	because the stack memory neesd to be allocated at compile time
Mar 02 13:09:43 <trev>	naokotani: String is heap allocated so yeah

Mar 02 18:21:22 <trev>	is this part of the CL vs clojure debate?
Mar 02 18:21:25 <Marvin2>	is this part of building a toy like this.
Mar 02 18:21:43 <benoitj>	trev: is there a debate? we're sharing cool features of each languages
Mar 02 18:23:40 <daviwil>	Is that using a transducer or something that only iterates on demand? 
Mar 02 18:23:46 <trev>	it's always a debate when CL's dignity is on the line
Mar 02 18:25:40 <benoitj>	daviwil: not transducers here, just lazy sequences, the "cons cells" in clojure is an abstraction called seq, and many of the sequence functions like map, filter, and so on use lazy seq, which returns the recipe to realize the data, without evaluating it. map does it by chunk, if you try to take one value, i'll compute 32 values to make things efficient
Mar 02 18:25:43 <Marvin2>	daviwil: not transducers here, just lazy sequences, the "cons cells" in clojure
Mar 02 18:25:58 <benoitj>	haha
Mar 02 18:26:09 <daviwil>	Gotcha, I forgot about the seq mechanics 
Mar 02 18:26:20 <daviwil>	It's been a long time since I Clojured

Mar 02 18:26:56 <benoitj>	:D
Mar 02 18:27:52 <benoitj>	like in the example below, if by mistake I print that value in the repl, it'll print forever
Mar 02 18:28:38 <benoitj>	transducers are ways to combine processing streams that can act on collections, seqs, but also on discrete values
Mar 02 18:28:40 <Marvin2>	transducers are ways to elimate that
Mar 02 18:28:57 <benoitj>	not sure where this is coming :P

Mar 02 18:39:41 <Marvin2>	daviwil: it's rough for a 'plain passphrase'
Mar 02 18:40:19 <daviwil>	I agree 
Mar 02 18:44:33 <benoitj>	we tried to get technical writers to write our guidelines, did not work well :P
Mar 02 18:44:49 <benoitj>	ended up taking more time, and we still had to do it

Mar 02 19:21:49 <Fade>	man, you blink and a lot happens around here. :)
Mar 02 19:22:21 <Fade>	so when you take the car of a seq in clojure, it yields a lambda that produces the next value?
Mar 02 19:22:26 <Fade>	they're generators?
Mar 02 19:25:27 <Fade>	although I guess there's probably machinery in the JVM to iteratively produce the values on some delayed schedule. they're probably not literally lambdas...
Mar 02 19:25:52 <Fade>	is this idiom used for, say, network servers?

Mar 03 10:51:29 <sebastiant>	... migrating from projectile and perspective to project.el im finding it hard to track currently active project. Any advice?
Mar 03 10:52:10 <sebastiant>	Sort of expected there to be built in mode-line support
Mar 03 10:56:28 <glenneth->	Thanks trev Opened it up, just on my way out grocery shopping.  I'll check it when I get back 
Mar 03 10:57:57 <daviwil>	sebastiant: You could add something like this to your configuration: https://0x0.st/H7Z8.txt
Mar 03 10:58:02 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/fIgBK ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 03 10:58:24 <daviwil>	that's very basic, probably needs some polish
Mar 03 11:03:23 <sebastiant>	Thanks! Another thing that surprised me was the logic in project-switch-project. I would have expected it to open last visited buffer of selected project. Maybe im mixing my expectations up a bit since removing perspective, but do you use that default behaviour or are there popular alternatives?
Mar 03 11:03:41 <glenneth>	I also need to close down znc 
Mar 03 11:06:16 <daviwil>	sebastiant: You can add any project behavior switching you like by taking a look at project-switch-commands, you can set it to the symbol for a function that decides what to do when you switch projects.  You'd probably need some logic to keep track of hte last open buffer of the given project, not sure of the best way to get that.  I normally just set `project-switch-project` to `magit-status` or something like thta
Mar 03 11:10:35 <sebastiant>	Cheers!
Mar 03 12:40:10 <trev>	quiet sunday
Mar 03 12:47:40 <daviwil>	everybody left us, trev
Mar 03 12:48:40 <trev>	i finally get a few minutes to sit down and i can't think of what to do
Mar 03 12:48:43 <Marvin2>	i finally set a old thinkpad as a project manager
Mar 03 12:49:00 <daviwil>	you'll never be alone when marvin is here to say something dumb
Mar 03 12:49:08 <trev>	hahah
Mar 03 12:49:27 <trev>	i can hear the disdain in your voice
Mar 03 12:53:24 <trev>	daviwil: did you get the PC parts yet?
Mar 03 12:55:55 <daviwil>	nah, I"m waiting to set up a business in Greece so I can expense it all correctly
Mar 03 13:05:28 <tonyab>	I finally got around to following emacs from scratch series (old one, been lazy lol) and seems general.el is now "deprecated", and maybe on its way out of peoples dotfiles.  There isn't a systemcrafters video on that is there?  Was it mainly used to make leader keys etc. for hydra usage?
Mar 03 13:10:40 <daviwil>	tonyab: Hadn't heard about general.el being deprecated, but I guess it's due to the new keymap functionality in Emacs?
Mar 03 13:10:50 <daviwil>	I don't have a video on that yet, but it's a good idea for sure
Mar 03 13:13:17 <tonyab>	Nice. Well the maintainer is calling it "deprecated" tongue in cheek as in maybe bloated but stable I guess.  I just noticed it seems like scouring peoples configs it also seems like maybe people found a faster way to achieve what they used to with general.el.  I guess the new keymap functionality in emacs is maybe the ticket for people?  Or I
Mar 03 13:13:18 <tonyab>	just can't find general.el in people's configs randomly.
Mar 03 13:13:18 <trev>	bind-keys macro seems pretty powerful to me. i saw general.el as something that is more useful for evil-mode. didn't fully read the manuals though
Mar 03 13:13:20 <Marvin2>	just can't find the originally Sherri in a tree, and then make a power tool free for nerds to run whatever in place
Mar 03 13:13:21 <Marvin2>	Nice. Well the maintainer of stow?
Mar 03 13:15:01 <tonyab>	Hmm I meant the maintainer of general.el, can't tell if you are referring to me seems we all sent messages at the exact same time
Mar 03 13:15:10 <tonyab>	He's splitting general.el into like 10 packages
Mar 03 13:15:45 <daviwil>	tonyab: Marvin2 is a bot, ignore him :)
Mar 03 13:15:56 <tonyab>	Ah ok lol
Mar 03 13:17:25 <trev>	haha
Mar 03 13:18:07 <tonyab>	Well maybe I'll try out emacs builtin key bindings then
Mar 03 13:51:43 <glenneth>	wassup Folx. Starbucks break 😁
Mar 03 13:52:08 <trev>	glenneth: couldn't you send your personal assistant out for all those chores?
Mar 03 13:57:48 <glenneth>	apparently. I'm a terrible boss and he doesn't get paid enough to run these errands
Mar 03 13:59:41 <glenneth>	🤣
Mar 03 14:28:04 <nm0i>	Adventures of Trevin continue
Mar 03 14:28:06 <nm0i>	Morning all.
Mar 03 14:53:25 <Fade>	Good Morning
Mar 03 14:59:08 <benoitj>	hey fade
Mar 03 15:02:22 <mretka>	Hey nm0i Fade benoitj glenneth
Mar 03 15:02:51 *	mretka is diving deeper into the machine learning rabbit hole, now she started reading papers about ML algorithms
Mar 03 15:03:27 <Fade>	heya benoitj, mretka 
Mar 03 15:03:48 <mretka>	And I'm also learning how to weave multiple Jupyter notebooks together into a cohesive project, and send code and data between them
Mar 03 15:03:50 <Marvin2>	And I'm also learning how to type a password in authinfo or your libera code too, and it was a prot joke
Mar 03 15:04:11 <mretka>	rofl, dead
Mar 03 15:04:25 <Fade>	:)
Mar 03 15:04:53 <mretka>	Yeah, this is a thing Prot would def do
Mar 03 15:05:04 <mretka>	I mean, reading papers on ML algos
Mar 03 15:05:08 <Fade>	have you integrated jupyter with emacs?
Mar 03 15:05:33 <mretka>	Not yet, I'm feeling the urge to do that, but I wanna keep things as simple as possible for now
Mar 03 15:05:51 <Fade>	well, you're using jupyter, so that mission failed.
Mar 03 15:05:52 <Fade>	lol
Mar 03 15:06:04 <mretka>	My idea is to get the feel for how Jupyter is meant to be used, then try to put Emacs in the mix
Mar 03 15:06:07 <mretka>	lol, yeah
Mar 03 15:06:27 <mretka>	I'm exploring datasets in the Python shell inside Emacs though, so there's that
Mar 03 15:06:30 <Fade>	my understanding is that jupyter is a little like orgmode
Mar 03 15:06:35 <Fade>	with code blocks and prose
Mar 03 15:06:48 <mretka>	Although I need to get into jupyter to visualize the data with pandas and matplotlib and the like
Mar 03 15:06:59 <mretka>	Fade: yeah, it's pretty much the same thing, but with a GUI integration
Mar 03 15:07:17 <Fade>	emacs is a gui app!
Mar 03 15:07:20 <mretka>	There are cool ideas in there about organizing the literate programming stuff
Mar 03 15:07:30 <mretka>	Ah, yeah, you're correct
Mar 03 15:07:38 <mretka>	We can visualize data in org-babel with gnuplot
Mar 03 15:07:43 <Fade>	org itself is a gui integration. :D
Mar 03 15:08:24 <Fade>	sorry. just feeling a bit salty about python. I had to do some maintenance work on a very old python system from my distant past over the last month.
Mar 03 15:08:26 <Marvin2>	sorry. just feeling a bit longer
Mar 03 15:08:39 <Fade>	!status
Mar 03 15:08:41 <Marvin2>	status:: I know 36,323 phrases.
Mar 03 15:08:56 <mretka>	I understand the feeling completely Fade, I'm working between Ruby and Python now
Mar 03 15:09:04 <mretka>	And I also found this https://github.com/applied-science/emacs-vega-view
Mar 03 15:09:06 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/hMDsy ]::[ GitHub - applied-science/emacs-vega-view: A mode to facilitate interactive data visualization using Vega from within emacs ]
Mar 03 15:09:11 <Fade>	I'd take python over ruby, barely.
Mar 03 15:09:25 <Fade>	that looks interesting
Mar 03 15:09:31 <Fade>	what kind of data are you working with?
Mar 03 15:09:44 <mretka>	I used Vega Lite in Elixir a bit, but I'm sticking with the Python tools for now to get familiar with the ecosystem
Mar 03 15:09:57 <mretka>	Oh, just toy datasets for the moment
Mar 03 15:10:17 <mretka>	I'm practicing the end-to-end ML model workflow with the Titanic dataset from Kaggle
Mar 03 15:10:41 <mretka>	https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic
Mar 03 15:10:43 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/qbKBH ]::[ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster | Kaggle ]
Mar 03 15:12:36 <mretka>	This feels a lot like an end-to-end software deployment workflow
Mar 03 15:13:13 <Fade>	one thing that python has going for it, it has integration libraries for everything.
Mar 03 15:13:14 <mretka>	The extra steps when working with ML models are processing the training dataset, selecting which variables you want to pass to the model and "compiling" the model
Mar 03 15:13:38 <Fade>	it's so slow, I can't really picture using it for ML training.
Mar 03 15:15:01 <mretka>	Elixir is attempting to break into the ML training realm with the Livebook and Nx libraries by leveraging concurrent processing: https://livebook.dev/ https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx
Mar 03 15:15:04 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/CCUkK ]::[ Home - Livebook.dev ]
Mar 03 15:15:07 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/pMcSd ]::[ GitHub - elixir-nx/nx: Multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) and numerical definitions for Elixir ]
Mar 03 15:15:43 <Fade>	the erlang BEAM runtime is smarter than python, but I'd imagine you'd have to do something similar with python
Mar 03 15:16:43 <mretka>	What do you mean exactly?
Mar 03 15:17:18 <Fade>	I imagine erlang is sending job packets to little closures running in a compiled language
Mar 03 15:17:24 <Fade>	s/erlang/elixir
Mar 03 15:17:44 <Fade>	the actual training code for python is probably likewise running in a C lib.
Mar 03 15:18:30 <Fade>	this kind of work plan is easier in BEAM than it is in python, because the support for it is built in to the runtime.
Mar 03 15:31:25 <mretka>	Yeah, the training needs to run in the code inside the machine, it's easier to split the execution in the BEAM than directly in C libs
Mar 03 15:39:23 *	Fade nods
Mar 03 16:14:25 <sektor>	Howdy.
Mar 03 16:14:31 <nm0i>	Morning, sektor 
Mar 03 16:14:31 <sektor>	how are things?
Mar 03 16:21:02 <Fade>	ooh. there's a new sbcl
Mar 03 16:21:04 *	Fade builds it
Mar 03 16:21:14 <Fade>	heya, sektor, nm0i 
Mar 03 16:21:49 <naokotani>	woot
Mar 03 16:21:57 *	naokotani blows a party noise maker
Mar 03 16:24:45 <sektor>	Interesting; that reminds me I need to do package updates today.

Mar 04 05:03:57 <Fade>	exactly.

Mar 04 05:40:24 <benoitj>	possibly turning it off and on, and fsck the disk
Mar 04 05:41:02 <trev>	i'd like a job where i'm paid 3 days of work for saying that
Mar 04 05:43:26 <benoitj>	I mean, 6 hours is possibly a bit more than that. maybe replace a drive and restore a backup

Mar 04 06:13:25 <shom>	My eye doctor has a fancy laser machine that doesn't require dilation. Then she shows me the scans and I ask a lot of questions and she loves nerding out about it!
Mar 04 06:13:44 <benoitj>	shom: with the air stuff?
Mar 04 06:13:56 <benoitj>	I do get retinal scans too
Mar 04 06:14:07 <cow_2001>	woah
Mar 04 06:15:06 <shom>	Yeah, there's the puff of air machine and then there's the scanning machine, I has the line up target in your vision and then BAM! BRIGHT GREEN LASER
Mar 04 06:17:51 <shom>	I did zero computer crafting today but found an awesome deal an used wood crafting tool. Got a Grizzly jointer (makes one surface of wood perfectly flat) with a helical cutter head for $500 USD. The cutter alone costs $350 new! 
Mar 04 06:18:42 <cow_2001>	that's crafting
Mar 04 06:18:54 <cow_2001>	use earplugs
Mar 04 06:19:01 <glenneth>	shom: thicknesser/planer?
Mar 04 06:19:11 <cow_2001>	or ear... muffs thing
Mar 04 06:19:30 <benoitj>	shom: nice
Mar 04 06:19:58 <shom>	Ahh glenneth my UK friend I assume. A thicknesser is called a planer in the US and a UK planer is a jointer 
Mar 04 06:20:35 <benoitj>	why not a thickness planner?
Mar 04 06:20:51 <shom>	cow_2001: absolutely I wear the over the ears hearing protection, I need to be better about wearing a mask thkugh
Mar 04 06:21:04 <glenneth>	lol.  OK.  Good deal.  
Mar 04 06:21:07 <benoitj>	I mean, both are doing different things, one set thinkness right, the other makes the sides 90 degrees
Mar 04 06:21:12 <shom>	*though
Mar 04 06:21:34 <benoitj>	they are usually two different tools right?
Mar 04 06:21:37 <cow_2001>	shom: you deal with bad particles and fumes?
Mar 04 06:21:56 <glenneth>	yeah.  Faces and edges of boards
Mar 04 06:22:22 <shom>	benoitj: they are two different tools but you can get them in a combo machine 
Mar 04 06:22:48 <benoitj>	ok
Mar 04 06:22:59 <benoitj>	then it's a thinkness planner / jointer combo :D
Mar 04 06:23:27 <shom>	cow_2001: there's a lot of small particulate saw dust that's not good to breathe in the long run. So masks/respirators are a good idea
Mar 04 06:24:09 <shom>	benoitj: my thiNkness could use some planing 😂 
Mar 04 06:24:15 <benoitj>	:)
Mar 04 06:24:47 <benoitj>	I do have an old manual planer made of wood. it's like about 2 feet long
Mar 04 06:24:59 <glenneth>	shom: you need a cyclone in your dust extraction system :)
Mar 04 06:25:01 <benoitj>	hmm, maybe a bit more than a foot
Mar 04 06:25:54 <shom>	benoitj: those long handplanes are beasts! 
Mar 04 06:26:05 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 04 06:26:09 <benoitj>	with the wood handle too
Mar 04 06:26:14 <benoitj>	looks really cool
Mar 04 06:27:34 <shom>	glenneth: I have a Delta dust extractor that has a filter that dumps into a bag the "two story" kind. I do have a dust deputy cyclone for my shop vac that I use for sanding. What kind of stuff do you build? I've just been getting started really. 
Mar 04 06:27:37 <Marvin2>	glenneth: I have a lot of the channel but I thought about it
Mar 04 06:28:11 <shom>	Ha Marvin2 is right, I think more than I do. 
Mar 04 06:29:49 <glenneth>	shom: I don't.  My grandfather was a carpenter/cabinet maker.  I spent a lot of time in his workshop
Mar 04 06:32:01 <shom>	Oh that's really cool, I bet he had some good stories to tell. No one in my family was handy (just book and news readers) so I'm a little envious of your experience. I'm coming into the world of doing things with your hands later in life. Better late than never! 
Mar 04 06:33:12 <shom>	Goodnight everyone, thanks for wood crafting indulgence. 
Mar 04 06:34:00 <benoitj>	shom: nite
Mar 04 06:34:11 <benoitj>	shom: crafting is crafting
Mar 04 06:34:37 <glenneth>	nite shom 
Mar 04 06:35:10 <shom>	benoitj: glenneth ☺ hope you have a happy Monday! 
Mar 04 06:35:13 <Marvin2>	benoitj: glenneth ☺ hope you have a really good view of everst
Mar 04 06:35:59 <glenneth>	lol
Mar 04 07:11:20 <trev>	glenneth: what's the plan today, boss?
Mar 04 07:11:22 <Marvin2>	glenneth: what's the position responsible for?
Mar 04 07:20:44 <glenneth>	trev: finishing up a proposal for a job in Kuwait.  You?
Mar 04 07:37:52 <trev>	glenneth: oh, you know, just looking for a custom keycap
Mar 04 07:41:51 <glenneth>	haha.  Artisan?  A whole set or singular?
Mar 04 07:43:14 <trev>	i guess whole set since i can't find a 2u size that will fit on an ortholinear
Mar 04 07:44:31 <trev>	which keycap profile do you use glenneth ?
Mar 04 08:07:19 <fyrfaras>	Good meowning everybunny :3 !
Mar 04 08:08:14 <daviwil>	good morning all
Mar 04 08:08:17 <daviwil>	hey fyrfaras
Mar 04 08:08:33 <trev>	good morning
Mar 04 08:09:24 <glenneth>	trev: Mine are the topre keycaps for the hhkb.  Closer to OEM than Cherry I think
Mar 04 08:09:34 <glenneth>	hey fyrfaras o/
Mar 04 08:11:15 <glenneth>	trying to find an xda pofile for it though
Mar 04 08:11:35 <trev>	i am using xda now
Mar 04 08:13:26 <glenneth>	I have xda on my keychron Q10
Mar 04 08:14:50 <fyrfaras`>	Heya~ trev, glenneth and daviwil ^w^
Mar 04 08:15:25 <glenneth>	hey daviwil o/
Mar 04 08:15:42 <daviwil>	hey glenneth
Mar 04 08:18:08 <daviwil>	time to start doing taxes this week 🤮
Mar 04 08:19:09 <trev>	dun dun dunnn
Mar 04 08:19:51 <glenneth>	that's what accountants are for daviwil :)
Mar 04 08:20:45 <daviwil>	yeah, we have accountants for some parts, but there's still one part that I do myself because it costs more than I want to pay for the effort
Mar 04 08:21:40 <glenneth>	makes sense
Mar 04 08:22:23 <trev>	turbotax speedrun
Mar 04 08:22:27 <fyrfaras`>	Doing taxes myself is the last thing that keeps me from being a fully functional adult x3c
Mar 04 08:23:12 <daviwil>	taxes are annoying as hell
Mar 04 08:23:26 <daviwil>	that's like my biggest procrastination task of the year
Mar 04 08:23:37 <trev>	i'm a fully dysfunctional adult
Mar 04 08:24:28 <fyrfaras`>	Relatable ^^ My father is so super kind to handle taxes for me. I repay him with whiskey mostly xD
Mar 04 08:24:30 <trev>	my accountant went to prison for fraud
Mar 04 08:24:32 <glenneth>	Not a problem I have lol.  Digital nomad.  Don't pay taxes
Mar 04 08:25:28 <trev>	in the US if you make over $117K you're taxed globally
Mar 04 08:25:43 <daviwil>	glenneth: yep, just keep running from the taxman and they won't know where to send the penalty bills ;)
Mar 04 08:26:16 <glenneth>	really?  That sucks trev 
Mar 04 08:26:41 <trev>	yeah i think it's one of two countries that globally taxes its citizens 
Mar 04 08:26:46 <glenneth>	daviwil: I am truly non-domicile :D
Mar 04 08:27:03 <trev>	glenneth is heavily armed in a desert bunker
Mar 04 08:27:35 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 04 08:28:03 <daviwil>	I'm still waiting for glenneth's redacted personal blog
Mar 04 08:28:05 <Marvin2>	I'm still waiting for it...
Mar 04 08:28:08 <daviwil>	shut up marvin
Mar 04 08:28:11 <trev>	haha
Mar 04 08:28:31 <trev>	he doesn't miss a beat
Mar 04 08:28:36 <glenneth>	lol
Mar 04 08:28:43 <daviwil>	always interjecting at the most inappropriate time
Mar 04 08:28:49 <glenneth>	perfect timing
Mar 04 08:32:27 <trev>	taxes do yield some high anxiety. i always try to convince myself that they would never throw me in prison....right??
Mar 04 08:33:01 <daviwil>	you'd have to be making enough money for them to care
Mar 04 08:33:04 <Marvin2>	you'd have to spend my afternoon, but I think I'm good enough to run it CPU bound.
Mar 04 08:33:05 <daviwil>	not to say you don't
Mar 04 08:33:22 <daviwil>	I just think that they wouldn't bother prosecuting someone with a sub-million income
Mar 04 08:33:22 <trev>	that's what i hope
Mar 04 08:33:35 <daviwil>	they'll just fine you to hell
Mar 04 08:34:09 <trev>	from my understanding they just bother you for 7 years and then take serious action
Mar 04 08:34:22 <daviwil>	that's more reasonable
Mar 04 08:34:43 <glenneth>	In the UK it's the opposite.  They always seem to go for the smaller targets
Mar 04 08:34:51 <trev>	but like i said, my accountant was a fraud so i don't want them to come snoopin on me!
Mar 04 08:35:03 <glenneth>	Setting an example they call it 
Mar 04 08:35:11 <trev>	lol
Mar 04 08:35:46 <trev>	every time the taxman comes to someone's door, a knife crime occurs in the UK
Mar 04 08:35:49 <daviwil>	should have been obvious when he advertised himself as "Johnny Numbahs" in the phone book
Mar 04 08:36:04 <glenneth>	Seriously though.  I think I last paid a tax bill almost 20 yrs ago
Mar 04 08:36:16 <daviwil>	lucky man
Mar 04 08:37:06 <glenneth>	They have to find me first :)
Mar 04 08:37:12 <trev>	daviwil: when you open that street meat stand in greece, you'll have to pay the local mafia and taxes!
Mar 04 08:38:27 <daviwil>	looks like I should just create a new mafia instead
Mar 04 08:38:33 <daviwil>	more profit, less risk
Mar 04 08:39:49 <mickeynp>	glenneth: if you're british and a digital nomad i hope you have read HMRC's RDR1.
Mar 04 08:40:31 <mickeynp>	and ofc the RD3 as well as a supplemental
Mar 04 08:40:39 <daviwil>	hey mickeynp!
Mar 04 08:40:57 <mickeynp>	if you have 'significant ties' in the UK, working in the UK for a week or two could be enough to make you resident in the UK for tax purposes.
Mar 04 08:41:22 <mickeynp>	you're not domiciled, ever, in the uk, generally speaking, if your father is British and almost never if you were born British.
Mar 04 08:41:28 <mickeynp>	not "non-domiciled"*
Mar 04 08:41:37 <mickeynp>	hey David.
Mar 04 08:44:09 <glenneth>	my blog so far https://0x0.st/H7Ag.png :D
Mar 04 08:44:12 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/znaVp ]::[ Binary data ]
Mar 04 08:45:14 <glenneth>	mickeynp: As far as HMRC are concerned I am deceased :)
Mar 04 08:45:43 <mickeynp>	okay...
Mar 04 08:46:47 <glenneth>	I have zero ties to the UK.  No family, no property and I doubt I will ever go back except for visits
Mar 04 08:47:14 <mickeynp>	"the taxman can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."
Mar 04 08:47:58 <glenneth>	Nice quote.  But challenge accepted :D
Mar 04 08:48:10 <trev>	MI6 would never go after their top spy - glenneth 
Mar 04 08:48:44 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 04 08:55:05 <mickeynp>	writing a tree-sitter grammar is actually somewhat pleasant.
Mar 04 08:55:07 <Marvin2>	writing a lisp in Lua
Mar 04 08:55:18 <mickeynp>	even when I have to dip into C to write some custom scanner stuff.
Mar 04 08:56:30 <glenneth>	what grammaar are you writing?
Mar 04 08:57:39 <mickeynp>	a better jinja2 grammar
Mar 04 08:57:47 <mickeynp>	well, i'll try to split it out to handle Mako et al also
Mar 04 08:58:22 <alternateved>	Morning everyone
Mar 04 08:59:03 <glenneth>	hey alternateved o/
Mar 04 08:59:29 <glenneth>	mickeynp: cool :)
Mar 04 09:00:39 <trev>	mickeynp: are the grammars written in scheme?
Mar 04 09:01:19 <mickeynp>	Javascript and C
Mar 04 09:01:43 <mickeynp>	the query language is vaguely S-expression-y
Mar 04 09:01:57 <trev>	oh ok that is what i am thinking of
Mar 04 09:03:14 <mickeynp>	Javascript is a fine choice for the grammar though
Mar 04 09:03:28 <mickeynp>	instead of bikeshedding they just ran with that as it runs everywhere easily.
Mar 04 09:03:30 <Marvin2>	instead of insult
Mar 04 09:03:57 <mickeynp>	you still need a C compiler and more if you want rust bindings and whatnot.
Mar 04 09:20:46 <trev>	i was a treesitter hater until i realized that you can do some handy vim motions with it
Mar 04 09:20:49 <Marvin2>	i was at TSB.
Mar 04 09:25:26 <trev>	Marvin2: where is that?
Mar 04 09:25:44 <mickeynp>	a second-rate off-shoot of Lloyds bank
Mar 04 09:27:21 <trev>	marv must be getting ready to do his taxes too
Mar 04 09:27:26 <mickeynp>	why'd you hate TS?
Mar 04 09:27:33 <mickeynp>	installing it is a little bit painful in 29 I do admit
Mar 04 09:28:43 <trev>	i didn't think it was worthy of all the hype, only for some syntax highlighting. this was before i understood that i could do structural editing. i still don't really use it for more than 2-3 things though
Mar 04 09:28:46 <Marvin2>	i didn't mean it negatively...i should have paid more attention :)
Mar 04 09:29:17 <mickeynp>	yeah the highlighting is 'nice', but not a game changer.
Mar 04 09:29:34 <mickeynp>	the benefit is being able to write your own highlighter routines. I do that for things that bear special attention.
Mar 04 09:30:17 <mickeynp>	i built a piece of software for a client, and I used postgresql row-level security + roles, but I needed to assume 'admin' permissions (which I did with a context manager in Python) and I made Emacs highlight it using a TS query.
Mar 04 09:30:35 <mickeynp>	but the real power's in the CST for movement and editing, as you say.
Mar 04 09:45:29 <daviwil>	I still haven't started using TS in Emacs yet
Mar 04 09:45:30 <daviwil>	hey alternateved
Mar 04 10:04:39 <trev>	hi alternateved 
Mar 04 10:04:50 <alternateved>	hi
Mar 04 10:08:30 <mickeynp>	daviwil: how come?
Mar 04 10:10:57 <trev>	not needed for scheme and daviwil uses notepad++ for other languages
Mar 04 10:12:16 <daviwil>	mickeynp: just haven't made time for it yet, hacking on Emacs config actually comes last in the priority order surprisingly :)
Mar 04 11:00:45 <trev>	daviwil: tell the first priority
Mar 04 11:07:44 <daviwil>	working on projects
Mar 04 11:21:23 <trev>	i wish it was call of duty :[
Mar 04 12:01:49 <daviwil>	trev: I can only allocate an hour a day to that ;) 
Mar 04 13:50:02 <theesm>	Good morning crafters^^ 
Mar 04 13:59:30 <trev>	hey theesm 
Mar 04 14:01:55 <daviwil>	hey theesm
Mar 04 14:21:23 <theesm>	What's everybody up to today?
Mar 04 14:37:53 <naokotani>	working on my blog
Mar 04 14:38:27 <naokotani>	benoitj got mad at me because rss was broken and I didn't bother to properly set status codes
Mar 04 14:39:10 <naokotani>	status code issue is fixed, now i have to figure what the hell and rss is
Mar 04 14:39:11 <nm0i>	Can I get mad at you for not having an nntp mirror?..
Mar 04 14:39:34 <naokotani>	Can you? hell its your duty as a l337 crafter
Mar 04 14:41:57 <nm0i>	Why don't you serve rss over gopher?.. Pff, corporate shill, I bet you're against freedom in one way or another.
Mar 04 14:42:08 <nm0i>	Morning btw.
Mar 04 14:44:54 <naokotani>	true im a corporate shill. I am using digital ocean 
Mar 04 14:46:48 <naokotani>	Also, Have these gentleman ever seen a revoltution?
Mar 04 14:47:30 <nm0i>	Which gentleman?..
Mar 04 14:48:39 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 04 14:48:47 <naokotani>	its a phrase commonly used to troll anarchsts
Mar 04 14:48:52 <naokotani>	anarchists*
Mar 04 14:50:55 <nm0i>	Nah I'm just being sarcastic. If you want to troll me, use cookies.
Mar 04 14:51:14 <benoitj>	naokotani: ...
Mar 04 14:52:02 <naokotani>	? 
Mar 04 14:54:52 <trev>	not knowing what rss is should get you put in timeout
Mar 04 14:57:57 <naokotani>	I will submit to a timeout if that is the ruling
Mar 04 14:58:28 <daviwil>	"Wanna feel old?  Remember RSS?"
Mar 04 14:59:27 <trev>	the cool kids use atom now i guess (not the dead editor)
Mar 04 15:02:32 <naokotani>	Appanretly my site uses atom
Mar 04 15:02:35 <naokotani>	and I didn't tell it to
Mar 04 15:02:45 <naokotani>	I mean I guess I did inadvertently
Mar 04 15:05:46 <naokotani>	benoitj: how did you find this broken rss stuff?
Mar 04 15:06:27 <benoitj>	I just loaded your site in my reader
Mar 04 15:06:29 <Marvin2>	I just gave up after a night of cat watching
Mar 04 15:07:03 <naokotani>	what's your reader?
Mar 04 15:07:22 <daviwil>	Marvin2: don't give up, that can't isn't going to watch itself
Mar 04 15:07:25 <daviwil>	cat*
Mar 04 15:11:15 <benoitj>	naokotani: miniflux
Mar 04 15:11:38 <benoitj>	I also use elfeed, but miniflux does rss discovery
Mar 04 15:12:42 <benoitj>	it's not the first broken rss i've seen, so I just sent this over to a rss validator, but in your case it told me that weird "404!" body issue was not valid
Mar 04 15:12:51 <benoitj>	so I curled it to confirm
Mar 04 15:14:08 <naokotani>	yeah the 404! was very not valid. it had no head, no content type no status code. it was literally just plain text "404!"
Mar 04 15:16:25 <naokotani>	"Installing Miniflux is straightforward if you have some basic system administration knowledge." ngl I was really hoping for something along the lines of "apt install miniflux"
Mar 04 15:16:27 <Marvin2>	"Installing Miniflux is straightforward if you have lots of wind
Mar 04 15:16:48 <naokotani>	Actually, Marvin, I am not particually gassy today.
Mar 04 15:20:17 <naokotani>	Database configuration? can we not just use SQLite like a civilizaed app?
Mar 04 15:25:23 <naokotani>	so basically.... I would just make a route likes my-site.com/rss that would responde with this xml file that has each blog post as an item?
Mar 04 15:27:49 <benoitj>	naokotani: just use newsboat then, and point it to your atom feed
Mar 04 15:28:00 <benoitj>	or just put your atom feed into a RSS validator
Mar 04 15:29:04 <benoitj>	elfeed works equaly well
Mar 04 15:29:23 <benoitj>	I use miniflux because I like to access my feeds on multiple computers and I dont want to re-read stuff
Mar 04 15:31:09 <naokotani>	oohhhh
Mar 04 15:31:14 <naokotani>	I think i have it
Mar 04 15:31:42 <naokotani>	so the rss discovery thing is going to common rss feed urls and because its getting a code 200 it assumes it should exist
Mar 04 15:31:56 <benoitj>	you can test it by loading my feed: https://blog.benoitj.ca/posts/index.xml
Mar 04 15:31:57 <naokotani>	but then when it tries to load it, its invalid
Mar 04 15:31:59 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/WiKdB ]::[ Posts on My mostly tech blog ]
Mar 04 15:32:18 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 04 15:32:21 <benoitj>	it's not there
Mar 04 15:32:42 <benoitj>	your website tells my ready to find the rss feed in 4 different places, but these files are not there
Mar 04 15:32:50 <benoitj>	ready = reader
Mar 04 15:32:54 <naokotani>	so its going ot like chris-hughes.dev/feed, getting a 200 and then trying to load the xml file, getting osm eplain text which is 404! and complaining
Mar 04 15:33:02 <benoitj>	yep
Mar 04 15:33:47 <benoitj>	it's not typical to public 4 places like this. one is enough, but the xml has to be there :)
Mar 04 15:34:59 <naokotani>	my website was jsut returing 200 for any url that started with my domain name
Mar 04 15:36:06 <naokotani>	ok I think I have identified the problem. making the feed seems simple enough, I just need to figure out how to sort of the publish date
Mar 04 15:36:07 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 04 15:36:09 <Marvin2>	ok I think its kind of dangerous there
Mar 04 15:36:22 <benoitj>	nice
Mar 04 15:36:38 <benoitj>	mine is taken from hugo's "post date"
Mar 04 15:37:57 <naokotani>	I don't have the date anywhere. only thing that's close is the modified time in the filesystem, but every time I edit a post its going to change even if I just add a period, I don't htink people wnt ot be notified that I cahnged a period lol
Mar 04 15:38:00 <Marvin2>	I don't use sublime text anymore but it's a hack :)
Mar 04 15:38:46 <benoitj>	yeah, modified is not right as the date must be "immutable" and never change, otherwise the readers will detect new posts all the time
Mar 04 15:38:57 <benoitj>	predictable is the right word
Mar 04 15:39:30 <benoitj>	maybe that is something to fix first, have a post date? ;)
Mar 04 15:40:00 <naokotani>	True. I mean I can just put the title and POSTED: x y z athte top fo each
Mar 04 15:40:15 <benoitj>	if this was a "head" tag, maybe meta, then you would be able to pull it even from node
Mar 04 15:40:17 <naokotani>	I don't actually have an h1 on my posts
Mar 04 15:40:34 <naokotani>	yeah I just use um....
Mar 04 15:41:05 <naokotani>	cheerio
Mar 04 15:41:08 <naokotani>	its a web scraper
Mar 04 15:41:16 <naokotani>	thats how I make the thumbnails
Mar 04 15:41:19 <benoitj>	ok

Mar 04 18:58:47 <ashraz>	Hello, Crafters
Mar 04 19:09:27 <ashraz>	Huh. Slow day?
Mar 04 19:17:09 <benoitj>	yeah :)
Mar 04 19:17:24 <benoitj>	a bit of action this morning, but now it's been calm
Mar 04 19:19:33 <trev>	after the day defeats me i have nothing to say
Mar 04 19:24:22 <benoitj>	days of defeat?
Mar 04 19:35:17 <Fade>	sometimes victory seems a mere echo 
Mar 04 19:35:28 <Fade>	other days, it is a flawless symphony
Mar 04 19:35:34 <Fade>	but mostly, I'm deaf.
Mar 04 19:42:40 <trev>	hehe
Mar 04 20:09:04 <naokotani>	well, im the proud owner of a shiny new 404 page
Mar 04 20:14:18 <naokotani>	i wonder
Mar 04 20:14:36 <naokotani>	error underlines
Mar 04 20:14:42 <naokotani>	how do you change them
Mar 04 20:17:13 <sahil_>	I want to bind leader x in emacs to execute-current-file-function, which runs something like !g++ -o.... && ./exe, and shows the output in the minibuffer area. Then just pressing q closes the popped up minibuffer, and I can continue programming.
Mar 04 20:18:21 <sahil_>	I tried https://termbin.com/t4iq9 with the help of chatGPT, but this creates a new buffer each time, and I have to take the cursor to that buffer to close it

Mar 04 20:30:18 <naokotani>	what about complilation mode

Mar 05 07:40:00 <daviwil>	I'd also like to make a video on minimal CSS because it's quite possible to make your own style sheet without a lot of headache 
Mar 05 07:41:26 <apoorv569>	Could it be the re-directs?
Mar 05 07:42:15 <BigEatie>	apoorv569: I don't really like the idea of having massive headers -- would prefer the script take care of that kind of stuff. Pretty hackish what I'm doing right now: https://0x0.st/H71l.txt

Mar 05 07:43:04 <BigEatie>	sidebar.html contains the custom class info
Mar 05 07:43:24 <apoorv569>	Yes, that is the reason I am using david's publish.el I don't want to do stuff like that manually every time.
Mar 05 07:47:07 <BigEatie>	daviwil: Looking forward to it
Mar 05 08:02:25 <glenneth>	Hi o/.  Had to reboot.  Nvidia updates :)
Mar 05 08:05:43 <vii_majesty>	ah
Mar 05 08:17:10 <shom>	daviwil: i would love to see your take on minimal css which is still nice to look at. I'd imagine it would be like the system crafters site (which is both minimal and nice to look at). I've been playing with css grid and flex and it's quite nice with media queries. 
Mar 05 08:21:13 <shom>	apoorv569: terminal css is interesting, thanks. I also like water.css and pico.css since they're semantic css/HTML so it's nice to get the "paint" without committing to any specific "framework" 
Mar 05 08:25:09 <daviwil>	shom: Yeah, that's basically all you need
Mar 05 08:32:08 <glenneth>	hey shom o/.  I was just taking a look at y;ur site :)
Mar 05 08:32:17 <glenneth>	your*
Mar 05 08:36:37 <shom>	Hi glenneth! It's built with org to ox-hugo to hugo. But the film section is basically just grid and flexbox type deal. 
Mar 05 08:37:44 <glenneth>	Great photo's
Mar 05 08:38:42 <glenneth>	Saw it on the ox-hugo examples page.  Is that *THE* shom ?  lol
Mar 05 08:54:49 <trev>	might as well just make a gopher site
Mar 05 08:54:52 <Marvin2>	might as well just make a game. Open source projects and get better :)
Mar 05 08:55:09 <trev>	yeah, what marvin said
Mar 05 09:00:37 <alternateved>	Morning everyone
Mar 05 09:04:30 <shom>	glenneth: hahaha thanks... It's A me! Shom(io)!!
Mar 05 09:05:29 <glenneth>	I'm having ah issue with my hugo config.  I have set the base_url but when running hugo to export, all the links point back to localhost:1313 in the index.html file?  Any clue anyone? :)
Mar 05 09:06:06 <shom>	trev: I was generating a gemini site as well but never got the ci/cd setup. So unsurprisingly it never kept up. I should get it going. 
Mar 05 09:06:44 <shom>	glenneth: is the base url also set in the toml/yaml file? 
Mar 05 09:07:04 <shom>	o/ alternateved 
Mar 05 09:07:10 <shom>	Good morning 
Mar 05 09:35:24 <glenneth>	hey alternateved o/
Mar 05 09:36:05 <glenneth>	shom: I set it in the hugo.toml file
Mar 05 09:38:18 <shom>	Hmmmm do you have `#+hugo_base_dir: .` At the top of your org file? 
Mar 05 09:38:37 <shom>	Oh sorry I assumed you were using ox-hugo! Are you? 
Mar 05 09:38:46 <shom>	glenneth: 👆🏽 
Mar 05 09:41:36 <glenneth>	no.  Using easy-hugo, but I'm running hugo from the CLI
Mar 05 09:43:02 <glenneth>	using easy-hugoo just to manage the posts.  I'm not exporting anything from emacs just yet
Mar 05 10:00:55 <shom>	glenneth: are you running `hugo` or `hugo serve`? 
Mar 05 10:02:31 <shom>	As long as the other settings in the toml file are being honored (indicating there's not a shadowed file elsewhere) then base_url should be the only thing you need to set. Maybe even try with/out quotes around the base_url valje
Mar 05 10:02:38 <shom>	*value
Mar 05 10:12:32 <glenneth>	I run hugo then hugo server
Mar 05 10:13:32 <glenneth>	baseurl = "https://mysite.url.here"
Mar 05 10:13:34 <Marvin2>	[ https://mysite.url.here" ]::[ Couldn't fetch this page. ]
Mar 05 10:13:47 <shom>	Ah okay. When you run hugo server it will point it to local host. If you just run hugo command and check the public folder it should point to base url
Mar 05 10:14:15 <glenneth>	one sec
Mar 05 10:20:38 <apoorv569>	shom: Water css looks nice, pico doesn't look minimal enough for a text based blog site. It does look good though.
Mar 05 10:20:41 <Marvin2>	shom: Water css looks nice, pico doesn't look minimal enough for me :D
Mar 05 10:21:02 <apoorv569>	Thank you Marvin2
Mar 05 10:23:34 <shom>	apoorv569: for sure, pico is better for a web app not a text blog. Water is pretty small and a nice look out of the box. Hope I'll catch your site unveiling! 
Mar 05 10:23:36 <Marvin2>	apoorv569: for sure, that's what's really appealing about Rust. It's less rewiring my brain is running in CL.
Mar 05 10:24:49 <apoorv569>	shom: Yes, my site doesn't have much content yet, will go live once I have at least 2-3 blogs to go with.
Mar 05 10:24:52 <Marvin2>	shom: Yes, my site doesn't have much content yet, will go live once I get all of it once I get it going.
Mar 05 10:25:22 <apoorv569>	I'm very noob at writing BTW also english is not my first language, so I might not use the best words.
Mar 05 10:27:57 <shom>	apoorv569: it's all for fun, I hope you share when you're comfortable. I struggle with getting started so I've decided to just start... Hahaha actually I wrote a blog post about it https://shom.dev/posts/20240202_how-to-get-started/

Mar 05 10:29:35 <apoorv569>	Yes, same, I struggled with it as well, but finally just decided to do something rather than nothing :P
Mar 05 10:30:16 <apoorv569>	Thanks for sharing your blog, just a quick glance, I see a lot of stuff I have trouble with.
Mar 05 10:30:40 <shom>	Awesome! Also, your English is great. I'm sure your posts will be great too! 
Mar 05 10:30:56 <apoorv569>	Thank you! Appreciate it.
Mar 05 10:32:15 <glenneth>	I got something weird happening.  the site is https://my.site.url/glenneth/  but if i put that in the baseuri in my config, hugo then maes all of the links https://my.site.url/glenneth/glenneth/  and if i rmove the /glenneth/  hugo removes it too

Mar 05 10:32:35 *	glenneth is very confused
Mar 05 10:33:34 <glenneth>	shom you were  right though.  My mistake running hugo then hugo server
Mar 05 10:44:31 <trev>	marvin gets really annoying when expanding links and talking at the same time
Mar 05 10:44:43 <shom>	glenneth: you might need to turn on RelativeURLs=true
Mar 05 10:44:43 <shom>	CanonifyURLs=true
Mar 05 10:46:17 <shom>	Well RelativeURLs might not be strictly necessary 
Mar 05 10:48:00 <glenneth>	shom  I have just read that before coming back here to let you know I may have identified the issue :)
Mar 05 10:48:37 <glenneth>	I appreciate your time and your help shom 
Mar 05 10:50:15 <shom>	glenneth: yay! Glad it's figured out. Looking forward to checking out your and apoorv569 's blogs! 
Mar 05 10:52:33 <glenneth>	it was relativeURLS canonifyurls was aready true  changed relativeURLS = false to relativeURLS = true and the links are all correct.
Mar 05 10:54:56 <shom>	Ah, good to know. The documentation is a bit confusing on that! So you set canonifyURLs to false then? 
Mar 05 11:32:10 <glenneth>	not yet.  That's my next step because the theme isn.t being picked up correctly
Mar 05 12:14:31 <glenneth>	OMG!!! It is actually working :) :D
Mar 05 12:14:48 <daviwil>	nice :)
Mar 05 12:15:01 <glenneth>	correct theme ahd everything
Mar 05 12:15:57 <glenneth>	Thanks daviwil 
Mar 05 12:16:55 <glenneth>	And a massive thank you shom .  Thank you for your patience.
Mar 05 12:17:52 <glenneth>	Now I have to think of something worth posting lol
Mar 05 12:49:30 <naokotani>	You have a blog?
Mar 05 12:52:36 <glenneth>	It looks like I do now naokotani  :) or at least very soon(ish)
Mar 05 12:54:49 <naokotani>	Sick dope. how did you make it?
Mar 05 12:56:57 <glenneth>	hugo and github pages.  Though I'm sure I've got the github end configured incorrectly :D
Mar 05 12:58:16 <naokotani>	Nice. Benoit usese huge too. I decided to go with some janky mess I hacked together myself

Mar 05 12:59:46 <glenneth>	nice.  I caught the backend of your conversation with benoitj earlier
Mar 05 13:00:39 <naokotani>	IT was a whole entire journey. I had to figure out how to create a publishing date and then pull that out of the html and format it correctly among other things
Mar 05 13:00:43 <Marvin2>	IT was for hand written links and just moving thousands of lines of code to generate a response.
Mar 05 13:00:49 <naokotani>	but I think its working pretty good now
Mar 05 13:01:03 <glenneth>	added to my elfeed :)
Mar 05 13:01:31 <glenneth>	8 posts to read
Mar 05 13:02:24 <naokotani>	I don't know if tehy are exactly page turners, but that sound about right
Mar 05 13:02:38 <naokotani>	actaully as an engineer you might find the diesel database one somewhat interest
Mar 05 13:03:00 <naokotani>	My brother is a chemical engineer and I showed him plantuml and he was right into it
Mar 05 13:03:22 <naokotani>	He needed something to create plant startup procedures or something
Mar 05 13:04:02 <glenneth>	Ahh.  OK.  I'll definitely check them out
Mar 05 13:04:39 <glenneth>	plant startup.  Always bad on the nerves lol
Mar 05 13:05:22 <naokotani>	probably lol. His stuff is for experiments
Mar 05 13:05:45 <naokotani>	He does energy research
Mar 05 13:06:53 <glenneth>	cool.  I mainly work on energy production and distribution
Mar 05 13:07:35 <glenneth>	Power plant, overhead power lines and sub-stations
Mar 05 13:07:37 <naokotani>	oh, so similar stuff, but you are more on the electrical engineering side
Mar 05 13:07:46 <glenneth>	Yeah
Mar 05 13:08:07 <glenneth>	brb - Coffee
Mar 05 13:08:08 <naokotani>	yeah the overlap would be power plants. 
Mar 05 13:08:56 <naokotani>	My dad did a lot of the power line and sub station stuff. He did research and project management for the power utility in our province. 
Mar 05 13:09:25 <naokotani>	When I was a kid he worked a lot of micro hydro and wind projects in the remote northern areas
Mar 05 13:22:46 <glenneth>	I've worked on hydro, nuclear, gas, coai and diesel fired power plants.  But nearly all were 50 > MW plant

Mar 05 13:24:24 <naokotani>	I helped fix the wheel on a truck lol
Mar 05 13:25:31 <naokotani>	The issue is that those communities there is no way to get power from the outside. They either need to truck in diesel for generators or use renewables

Mar 05 13:32:21 <naokotani>	that's the place. 227km from the nearest paved road. You can only drive there in teh winter because you need to drive over lakes to get there
Mar 05 13:37:09 <glenneth>	Sounds and looks awesome lol.  Dangerous
Mar 05 13:38:41 <glenneth>	I tried for a position in Iceland working geothermal, but I didn't get it 
Mar 05 13:40:26 <naokotani>	um. it can be a bit dangerous because its really isolated. if you car breaks down on that road you better have a sleeping bag
Mar 05 13:40:28 <Marvin2>	um. it can be useful
Mar 05 13:41:22 <naokotani>	but in the winter the road is pretty safe for cars. the ice gets to like 1-2 meters thick and they drive transport trucks with huge mining equipment on them
Mar 05 13:41:25 <Marvin2>	but in your container diagram, and then at some point.
Mar 05 13:41:57 <naokotani>	pretty common for it to be -40 to -45 in the winter there
Mar 05 13:42:23 <glenneth>	celsius?
Mar 05 13:42:31 <naokotani>	yeah, celsius
Mar 05 13:43:58 <glenneth>	I've become too soft, working in the middle east.  The thought of going back to the UK in winter fills me with dread :D
Mar 05 13:45:33 <naokotani>	The people here would die instantly in the middle east
Mar 05 13:45:44 <naokotani>	if it gets to like 28 celsius here people freak out
Mar 05 13:46:42 <naokotani>	but I know what you mean. I spent about 3 years where I was out of canada for the winter and my first winter back was very uncomfortable
Mar 05 13:46:46 <Marvin2>	but I did with a bachelor's in something random who got into it a hand holding sort of an ops background
Mar 05 13:52:15 <glenneth>	Yeah, I've worked in 50+ deg C in Kuwait.  Regularly too.  It's horrible
Mar 05 13:53:11 <naokotani>	I've never really been anywhere particularly hot. I was in India, but it was winter
Mar 05 13:53:27 <naokotani>	oh yeah lol. I was In Kerala during spring and that was really damn hot
Mar 05 13:53:27 <glenneth>	it starts getting down to 20C and I start to complain it's getting cold :D
Mar 05 13:53:30 <Marvin2>	oh yeah that is true
Mar 05 13:53:32 <Marvin2>	it starts getting down to delete words that would be interesting. Some of our nepal trip pictures
Mar 05 13:53:44 <naokotani>	it was I think about 36c
Mar 05 13:53:53 <glenneth>	I see Marvin2 is on form
Mar 05 13:53:59 <naokotani>	but like 98% humidity
Mar 05 13:54:36 <naokotani>	I was with this person from Holland and we played a light game of frisbee in the shade for like 10 minutes and she started throwing up
Mar 05 13:55:31 <glenneth_>	yeah. that's what made Kuwait so bad. right on the gulf coast
Mar 05 13:58:40 <naokotani>	I finally broke down and went back to tmux
Mar 05 14:00:54 <trev>	naokotani: that was fast
Mar 05 14:00:55 <Marvin2>	naokotani: that is
Mar 05 14:01:32 <naokotani>	Really? I used zellij for... well several months at least
Mar 05 14:01:57 <trev>	oh i thought you were only just trying it out for a few days lol
Mar 05 14:02:01 <naokotani>	It started just randomly deciding it prefered horizontal splits and I was like ight, im out
Mar 05 14:02:18 <trev>	you can't control it?
Mar 05 14:02:42 <naokotani>	I assume you must be able to, but I was having a hard time figuring it out
Mar 05 14:03:01 <naokotani>	there is a new pane and it seems to hav ea bit of a mind of its own
Mar 05 14:04:36 <naokotani>	I think if the developer sticks with it its going to be great, but it still feels a tiny bit under cooked
Mar 05 14:10:06 <trev>	tmux doesn't have the appeal that modern projects have i guess
Mar 05 14:10:53 <trev>	lacking a nice config language, uses a man page instead of github readme/wiki
Mar 05 14:11:32 <naokotani>	yeah. if I configured tmux anywhere near to the same extent as vim let alone emacs that woul dbe more of an issue
Mar 05 14:11:33 <trev>	it's powerful but no one cares to read the docs
Mar 05 14:12:11 <naokotani>	although, yeah I am sure if I read the docs it does all kinds of nifty stuff
Mar 05 14:13:00 <trev>	but also it does what it needs to right away, as long as you can figure out how to hit the prefix and create some panes and windows then it's enough for most people
Mar 05 14:13:57 <naokotani>	I am sure if I were more inot the system admin side of things I would be more interested in learning its features
Mar 05 14:18:34 <trev>	i use it locally too, since it works nicely with nvim. I know that people not prefer using terminals that have built in multiplexing like kitty or wezterm
Mar 05 14:18:50 <trev>	tabs and splits and whatever else they stuff in them
Mar 05 14:20:10 <naokotani>	I am windows terminal man myself
Mar 05 14:20:14 <naokotani>	I think it does that stuff
Mar 05 14:20:19 <naokotani>	well I know it does tabs
Mar 05 14:20:37 <naokotani>	its actually a very good terminal
Mar 05 14:21:28 <naokotani>	its got a really nice gui configuration, its got a good json configuration. really the only bad thing about I can think of it is its microsoft
Mar 05 14:22:56 <trev>	my dad owns michaelsoft
Mar 05 14:23:06 <trev>	don't make fun of it
Mar 05 15:43:28 <glenneth>	just got a message that my glove80 has arrived :)
Mar 05 15:43:55 <glenneth>	what a day
Mar 05 16:11:48 <Fade>	Good Morning
Mar 05 16:12:03 <daviwil>	hey Fade
Mar 05 16:13:03 <Fade>	heya, daviwil 
Mar 05 16:14:25 <alternateved>	hey Fade 
Mar 05 16:14:35 <talos>	Good day all~
Mar 05 16:14:36 <trev>	hi Marvin2's dad
Mar 05 16:15:06 <Fade>	trevoni the trevster
Mar 05 16:15:18 <Fade>	alternateved, talos 
Mar 05 16:16:18 <talos>	Yo~
Mar 05 16:20:40 <naokotani>	Hello *
Mar 05 16:21:03 <naokotani>	It's 11:20 and I haven't done a damn thing all day
Mar 05 16:21:21 <naokotani>	what an unmitigated disaster
Mar 05 16:21:32 <glenneth>	Fade: o/
Mar 05 16:21:49 <glenneth>	hey talos 
Mar 05 16:23:11 <Fade>	heya, glenneth 
Mar 05 16:24:00 <glenneth>	how's things?
Mar 05 16:24:34 <talos>	Hiyo glenneth
Mar 05 16:24:54 <talos>	Just woke up about 30 min ago here lol
Mar 05 16:24:59 <Marvin2>	Just woke up today, I looked at yesterday, you are asking questions above my pay grade there
Mar 05 16:25:07 <talos>	lmao
Mar 05 16:25:12 <glenneth>	lol
Mar 05 16:25:25 <Fade>	not too bad. I was on dad-ops duty today, making the child clean and making his lunch, so I feel like I've had a full day, and my init routine isn't even finished. :]
Mar 05 16:25:41 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 05 16:26:43 <glenneth>	that's an unknown world to me 
Mar 05 16:27:04 <Fade>	sometimes I miss my bachelor days, but never seriously.
Mar 05 16:27:55 <Fade>	TIL that children can't bring peanut butter sandwiches to school.
Mar 05 16:28:19 <Fade>	since I ate this type of sandwich at school every day of my public school career, I was very surprised.
Mar 05 16:28:22 <glenneth>	i have nothing to compare it against :)
Mar 05 16:28:44 <glenneth>	allergys?
Mar 05 16:28:56 <Fade>	apparently peanut allergies are a real problem now.
Mar 05 16:29:16 <Fade>	like even walking by a school with a snickers bar in your pocket could get you arrested on attempted murder charges.
Mar 05 16:29:19 <Marvin2>	like even walking by a billionaire.
Mar 05 16:29:28 <glenneth>	lol
Mar 05 16:29:32 <daviwil>	well, maybe
Mar 05 16:29:50 <Fade>	my wife was ++anoyed. she foned me just as I was finishing three sandwiches and she was all "THROW IT OUT!"
Mar 05 16:29:54 <Marvin2>	my wife was ++anoyed. she foned me just as I could
Mar 05 16:30:11 <Fade>	<Fade> WTF are you talking about woman?! don't know know how much work just happened right here?
Mar 05 16:30:14 <Marvin2>	<Fade> WTF are you guys ready for the summer lore
Mar 05 16:30:29 <naokotani>	what what out? the sandwhiches?
Mar 05 16:30:33 <naokotani>	throw what*
Mar 05 16:30:40 <Fade>	the sandwiches
Mar 05 16:30:42 <glenneth>	even marcus has a wife
Mar 05 16:30:52 <naokotani>	Not a big sandwhich eater I guess
Mar 05 16:30:59 <glenneth>	Marvin2: even
Mar 05 16:31:01 <Fade>	in the general case I can recommend the wife experience.
Mar 05 16:31:05 <Fade>	five stars.
Mar 05 16:31:22 <Fade>	sometimes, there aren't any stars to be found, but it's still worth it. :D
Mar 05 16:31:54 <glenneth>	crossed that bridge already i think
Mar 05 16:31:56 <Fade>	naokotani: I think it was strictly down to the fact that they were peanut butter and jam sandwiches.
Mar 05 16:32:00 <naokotani>	oh, yeah I ahve a wife
Mar 05 16:32:32 <glenneth>	dammit naokotani you too? 
Mar 05 16:32:37 <daviwil>	borat voice: "my wife"
Mar 05 16:32:44 <glenneth>	jk 
Mar 05 16:32:44 <Fade>	what an unusual tribe of geeks assembled here.
Mar 05 16:33:08 <Fade>	all wifed up. only glenneth is sane, and he's living in the fucking middle east.
Mar 05 16:33:11 <Fade>	lol
Mar 05 16:33:32 <glenneth>	true :)
Mar 05 16:33:34 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 05 16:33:49 <naokotani>	most people have wives right?
Mar 05 16:33:54 <naokotani>	I think its somewhat common
Mar 05 16:33:58 <visl>	i dunno if peanut allergies are more of a real problem than they used to be. times have changed. when i was a wee lad it was the allergic kid's responsibility to not eat peanuts. these days it's everyone's problem
Mar 05 16:34:07 <Fade>	it's not that common in geeky circles.
Mar 05 16:34:11 <Fade>	or not *as* common.
Mar 05 16:34:19 <trev>	i love PB&Js
Mar 05 16:34:41 <Fade>	trev: pretty much all the north american children of my generation were made out of PB&J.
Mar 05 16:34:45 <naokotani>	peanut allergy has probably always been a thing and they just couldn't figure out why a lot of kids weren't getting past kingergarten
Mar 05 16:34:46 <benoitj>	visl: what do you mean? I still think it's the kids responsibilities
Mar 05 16:34:49 <Marvin2>	visl: what do you like the pens
Mar 05 16:35:03 <trev>	i had a slight p-nut allergy but i somehow got over it
Mar 05 16:35:15 <trev>	it still closes my throat a little if i eat too much
Mar 05 16:35:23 <naokotani>	You know what the joker says, what doesn't kill you makes you stranger
Mar 05 16:35:29 <daviwil>	trev: You're allergic to the bass player of 311?
Mar 05 16:35:31 <benoitj>	but it's everyone's responsibility to make sure to clearly state if there are peanuts in their stuff
Mar 05 16:35:36 <Fade>	at this point, I'm very very strange.
Mar 05 16:35:50 <visl>	benoitj: fade used to be able to take pb sandwiches, but now fade jr. cannot. now it's fade/fade jr.'s responsibility (in addition to the allergic one) instead of just the allergic one 
Mar 05 16:36:05 <glenneth>	you and me both Fade 
Mar 05 16:36:26 <naokotani>	When I was in university this guy was eating a peanut butter raisin and magic mushroom sandwhich and this strict muslim guy asked what it was and he just disclosed the peanut butter and raisins so he snatched it took a huge bite
Mar 05 16:36:40 <benoitj>	visl: I dont think it's like that, it's a learning process and parents are part of the learning process. what do you expect, the young kids to just "experiment" and find out what works?
Mar 05 16:36:53 <Fade>	I was told by my friend, a pediatrician, that some children can have deadly reactions to even the odor of peanut butter.
Mar 05 16:36:55 <naokotani>	then he got super high, angry and vacuumed his room the entire night 
Mar 05 16:37:06 <Fade>	(I just called her on account of my newly acquired info)
Mar 05 16:37:28 <trev>	even when i was in school they had a "no peanut butter" table
Mar 05 16:37:40 <naokotani>	I Think if its legit going to kill children we can probably just eat something else realistically
Mar 05 16:37:54 <Fade>	I haven't been my son's age since 1979.
Mar 05 16:37:55 <benoitj>	visl: it's the parent's responsibility to teach them to be responsible with that, but that takes time and a bit of maturity
Mar 05 16:38:03 <Fade>	times were different back then. 
Mar 05 16:38:12 <Fade>	I died once, and my mother made me walk it off.
Mar 05 16:38:12 <visl>	benoitj: hah. i'm not putting expectations on anything. i don't think it's good or bad. it just is.  in addition to peanuts, my kid can't take snacks with gluten or dairy snacks because of the vegan kid
Mar 05 16:38:15 <naokotani>	I havne't been my son's age since 1990
Mar 05 16:38:16 <benoitj>	+ when we do groceries, not my kid who do it
Mar 05 16:39:03 <visl>	benoitj: i'm not complaining about it. it's just now a community thing now
Mar 05 16:39:27 <Fade>	I don't think vegans get to dictate what's in my kid's lunch.
Mar 05 16:39:31 <benoitj>	visl: oh, that is a different problem with schooling systems. crazy parents sueing schools for anything and everything, including allergy. and the school's transition to "no risk" thing
Mar 05 16:39:47 <Fade>	I scrapped the sandwiches and sent him with left-over pizza.
Mar 05 16:40:00 <visl>	an upgrade!
Mar 05 16:40:06 <Fade>	it was an upgrade
Mar 05 16:40:11 <Fade>	now I don't get any lunch. :)
Mar 05 16:40:12 <Fade>	lol
Mar 05 16:41:20 <benoitj>	there is an age thing though, the tricky time is when they are <7 ish, especially if they just recently got diagnosis
Mar 05 16:42:14 <Fade>	i've never heard of lunch restrictions before today, but they don't seem unreasonable given the gravity of anaphylactic shock. forcing my family to conform to the dietary whims of vegans is not on. I've never heard of that before.
Mar 05 16:42:36 <benoitj>	yeah, that is weird
Mar 05 16:42:44 <visl>	yeah.. i mean in the end it's not _too_ hard and we ignore it in the end. 
Mar 05 16:42:58 <visl>	we've taught our <7 to just not share, and i think the teachers help enforce it during lunch
Mar 05 16:43:13 <Fade>	poor vegan kid.
Mar 05 16:43:29 <Fade>	enjoy your soy curd, son!
Mar 05 16:43:30 <visl>	i even once suggested he share with his friend and he quickly corrected me
Mar 05 16:43:45 <visl>	yeah.. we worry a bit about the vegan kid. hope they're not malnourished 
Mar 05 16:45:58 <naokotani>	My son was vegetarian until he was about 3
Mar 05 16:46:17 <naokotani>	but he wasn't gaining neough weight so we put hiom on a strict diet of pork sausages
Mar 05 16:46:30 <Fade>	I was a vegetarian for a couple of years, but it almost killed me.
Mar 05 16:46:47 <naokotani>	I've been vegetarian since..... about 2010
Mar 05 16:46:57 <Fade>	I don't produce the enzyme that allows my body to extract protein from plants.
Mar 05 16:47:16 <Fade>	which is very common among native american people, and more common the further north you go.
Mar 05 16:47:35 <naokotani>	I am not native american in the slightest
Mar 05 16:47:46 <Fade>	so being a vegitarian made me fat and sick, which isn't what the promo material says on the brochure.
Mar 05 16:48:08 <Fade>	I am.
Mar 05 16:48:30 <Fade>	genetically. physically I'm straight out of central casting for the role of Irish Thug.
Mar 05 16:48:55 <naokotani>	I don't find it really had much effect on my weight one way or another
Mar 05 16:49:04 <naokotani>	actually, I didn't notice any difference at all
Mar 05 16:49:08 <naokotani>	on any level
Mar 05 16:49:34 <Fade>	being vegitarian has lots of benefits, just none of them were conducive to me staying alive.
Mar 05 16:49:56 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 05 16:50:03 <naokotani>	It's mostly religous for me
Mar 05 16:50:06 <naokotani>	religous reasons
Mar 05 16:50:30 <naokotani>	though if it has health benefits thats great I guess
Mar 05 16:50:55 <Fade>	once I was cured of catholicism, I found no need for the religionz.
Mar 05 16:51:56 <Fade>	I think everybody should do what makes them right with the world, so long as it doesn't become a proscription about me.
Mar 05 16:52:03 <naokotani>	I was raised atheist but I struggled with existential dread so I started practicing buddhism and I found it helped a lot
Mar 05 16:52:05 <visl>	i was vegetarian for a spell too, it also made me fat and sick but it's probably because i didn't prioritize actual vegetables. i was a bread and cheese vegetarian
Mar 05 16:52:42 <Fade>	I was pretty serious. I went to a nutritionist, and followed the prescribed diet, uhm, religiously.
Mar 05 16:52:49 <Fade>	and I still wound up fat and sick.
Mar 05 16:53:05 <naokotani>	I mostly eat potatoes
Mar 05 16:53:16 <Fade>	potatoes are a nearly perfect food.
Mar 05 16:53:18 <naokotani>	and I feel fine
Mar 05 16:53:28 <naokotani>	I knew a guy who only ate bananas for 12 yeras
Mar 05 16:53:39 <naokotani>	he had no eyebrows,b ut otherwise seemed very healthy for 78
Mar 05 16:53:45 <Fade>	naokotani: I assume you have a fairly standard western european genetic profile?
Mar 05 16:54:08 <naokotani>	Fade: incredibly
Mar 05 16:54:26 <Fade>	yeah. most of the militant dieticians I've met have been white euros.
Mar 05 16:54:58 <naokotani>	I think the whole nutrition thing is largely a red herring
Mar 05 16:55:02 <naokotani>	msotly what you need is prana
Mar 05 16:55:05 <Fade>	they get very annoyed with me when I point out their imperialist agression, largely because they're also white liberals.
Mar 05 16:55:26 <naokotani>	I am very much not a liberal
Mar 05 16:55:42 <Fade>	no, you're a tankie. we've already had this conversation. :)
Mar 05 16:55:54 <naokotani>	yes, dyed in the wool tankie
Mar 05 16:56:04 <Fade>	I doubt the vangard would have much time for your musings about prana. 
Mar 05 16:56:05 <Fade>	lol
Mar 05 16:56:06 <Marvin2>	I doubt I will use two editors at once?
Mar 05 16:56:29 <alternateved>	Well, everything is possible
Mar 05 16:56:43 <naokotani>	idk, the soviet union had some pretty out there science
Mar 05 16:57:12 <naokotani>	they probably thought nutrition was bourgois 
Mar 05 16:58:11 <naokotani>	actaully interestingly, Yoga is extremely popular all over the former soviet countries. Russia and India still have a very strong relationship
Mar 05 16:58:52 <naokotani>	I am not even going to begin to try to explain what they have in common.
Mar 05 17:00:38 <naokotani>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism
Mar 05 17:00:41 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/pVYGI ]::[ Lysenkoism - Wikipedia ]
Mar 05 17:01:49 <naokotani>	I also think the whole concept of a vanguard party is sort of red herring. for example. in liberal democracy we have a vanguard party composed of the business and political elites
Mar 05 17:03:26 <Fade>	in a socialist revolution the theory is that the vangard delivers the revolution to the peasants, and then educates them enough to devolve control of the party to the proletariat.
Mar 05 17:03:33 <Fade>	in practice, this has never happened.
Mar 05 17:04:02 <naokotani>	the issue is that its virtually impossible to not have a politcal vanguard in all but the smallest societies
Mar 05 17:05:57 <naokotani>	running society requires a high degree of speacialized knoweldge, just like any other field.
Mar 05 17:06:08 <Fade>	I don't think that's true, and I would cite the success of free software and of Mondragon in spain as specific examples, but this kind of discussion is not suited to a medium as low bandwidth as irc.
Mar 05 17:06:34 <naokotani>	well who runs free software? clearly the software development vaguard
Mar 05 17:06:37 <naokotani>	its not the general public
Mar 05 17:07:26 <naokotani>	you have a vaguard of cohort of people with highly speicalized knowlege that create free software and direct the course of its development
Mar 05 17:07:34 <Fade>	I think the only system that hasn't been actually attempted is federated anarchist mutual aid cells. of course, that requires an educated engaged society and some smart fascists basically made sure that wouldn't happen about fifty years ago.
Mar 05 17:08:51 <naokotani>	In an ideal society you want a highly educated society that is informed about what political specialists are up to in general terms, but not to a point that it detracts from their ability to perform their own function in society which will require some other form of specialzied knowledge
Mar 05 17:08:54 <Marvin2>	In an emumeration for the summer
Mar 05 17:09:36 <Fade>	so... it looks like the entirety of Meta is down.
Mar 05 17:09:44 <naokotani>	finally some good news
Mar 05 17:09:50 <Fade>	facebook, intagram, messenger
Mar 05 17:10:02 <naokotani>	so there is a god. a minute ago you were an atheist
Mar 05 17:10:03 <Fade>	their VR headsets are all offline.
Mar 05 17:10:21 <naokotani>	There is a god and he took some time out of his day to smite down facebook
Mar 05 17:11:12 <Fade>	my inner operator is running scenarios attempting to picture what could have teken down their entire footprint.
Mar 05 17:11:40 <Fade>	this is something that really shouldn't happen
Mar 05 17:11:42 <Marvin2>	this is coming :P
Mar 05 17:11:47 <Fade>	also, true.
Mar 05 17:12:01 <naokotani>	It seems like ther eis no good reasonw hy all of meta needs to be connected to the point this could hapen
Mar 05 17:12:26 <naokotani>	like why isn't instagram and facebook on totally diffirent infrastrucutre?
Mar 05 17:12:27 <Fade>	optimisation under profit concentrates data centres
Mar 05 17:12:34 <naokotani>	true
Mar 05 17:13:01 <naokotani>	well they have been having trouble making money of late. maybe they cut one too many corner
Mar 05 17:13:04 <Fade>	it's easier to heat and cool a really large data centre(s) than it is to have many implementations of the same infrastructure.
Mar 05 17:13:12 <Fade>	also, cheaper.
Mar 05 17:13:38 <naokotani>	while I can see that normally, i would think they are just so huge that it would be fine to have at least two
Mar 05 17:14:13 <Fade>	they have many hundreds.
Mar 05 17:14:30 <Fade>	the scale of that machine is so vast, it really cannot be understood by a single person.
Mar 05 17:14:44 <naokotani>	could be a geopolitcal enenmy of the US did it
Mar 05 17:15:15 <Fade>	on the balance of odds, I'd say somebody somewhere righteously fucked up the BGP routing tables.
Mar 05 17:15:27 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 05 17:15:49 <Fade>	leading to whatever insane storage system they're using for concrete state to go bad.
Mar 05 17:15:58 <Fade>	</guess>
Mar 05 17:17:25 <naokotani>	oh
Mar 05 17:17:31 <naokotani>	appanretly its osmethign to do with authentication
Mar 05 17:17:46 <Fade>	yep
Mar 05 17:17:47 <naokotani>	which acutally makes sense that that is cross platform
Mar 05 17:18:16 <Fade>	remember kids, PHP is good enough for facebook!
Mar 05 17:18:20 <naokotani>	maybe somebody accidetnally wrote drop table passwords;
Mar 05 17:19:08 <Fade>	little bobby tables grew up and got a job
Mar 05 17:19:28 <naokotani>	ooohh did you say create table crosswords? i thought you said drop table passwords; opps
Mar 05 17:21:55 <Fade>	https://phys.org/news/2024-03-high-temperature-superconducting-magnets-ready.html

Mar 05 17:22:11 <Fade>	20 tesla! wild
Mar 05 17:25:46 <Fade>	I wish i could still buy SPARC computers that weren't used.
Mar 05 17:26:04 <Fade>	I guess fujitsu is still making them for asian markets.
Mar 05 17:26:13 <Fade>	but not to the standards that Sun did.
Mar 05 17:30:14 <trev>	would you run Marvin3 on it?
Mar 05 17:30:34 <Fade>	on what?
Mar 05 17:31:12 <Fade>	Marvin3 runs on a lisp machine called sbcl. it in turn could run on just about any CPU from the past thirty years.
Mar 05 17:31:24 <Fade>	well, anything from the pentium onward.
Mar 05 17:31:42 <Fade>	but I'd have no trouble running my entire computational world on Sparc.
Mar 05 17:31:58 <Fade>	the hardware was as robust as any ever made.
Mar 05 17:32:22 <Fade>	s/3/2
Mar 05 17:32:38 <trev>	on the SPARC
Mar 05 17:32:49 <Fade>	for sure
Mar 05 17:32:56 <Fade>	sparc systems were great.
Mar 05 17:33:14 <Fade>	there was a time when over 70% of the internet ran on sparc machines.
Mar 05 17:33:58 <Fade>	step 1: incorporate company. step 2: get funding. step 3: call Sun Microsystems
Mar 05 17:34:04 <Fade>	i'm not even being hyperbolic.
Mar 05 17:34:05 <Fade>	lol
Mar 05 17:34:54 <Fade>	it's kind of amazing they managed to fuck that company up to the point where it doesn't exist any more.
Mar 05 17:35:00 <glenneth>	Fade: a 20,000 pound magnet.  That's insane
Mar 05 17:35:07 <Fade>	glenneth: right?
Mar 05 17:35:40 <glenneth>	brilliant, but insane
Mar 05 17:35:56 <Fade>	I love that kind of large scale engineering
Mar 05 17:38:21 <glenneth>	are you following this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER
Mar 05 17:38:25 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/wsChz ]::[ ITER - Wikipedia ]
Mar 05 17:39:14 <glenneth>	tokamak reactor in Europe
Mar 05 17:42:01 <Fade>	absolutely
Mar 05 17:42:33 <glenneth>	firing up
Mar 05 17:42:56 <glenneth>	the end of next year
Mar 05 17:43:04 <Fade>	iter is one of the projects that gives me some modicum of hope for my species.
Mar 05 17:43:15 <glenneth>	yup
Mar 05 17:43:23 <glenneth>	either
Mar 05 17:43:54 <glenneth>	it works or the planet implodes
Mar 05 17:43:57 <shom>	I know we've moved on peanut butter but I just want to say this comment made me unreasonably amused. Fade :I died once, and my mother made me walk it off.
Mar 05 17:43:59 <Marvin2>	I know a bit part of "the south")
Mar 05 17:44:00 <Fade>	the americans have been making some real advancements in plasma control systems which are likely to really buff ITER.
Mar 05 17:44:19 <glenneth>	i'm good either way :)
Mar 05 17:44:24 <Fade>	totally
Mar 05 17:44:26 <Fade>	shom: :D
Mar 05 17:46:27 <glenneth>	going to eat.  I may be back o7
Mar 05 17:46:30 <shom>	Also glenneth glad I could help, I never get to help in system crafters 😂. Your first post could be the first post for every static site generator blog: how I build my static blog
Mar 05 17:46:38 <Marvin2>	Also glenneth glad I could recommend emacs, but im not sure if I stay on their good side and get the links to get as much good code as I might to use a "normal" keyboard
Mar 05 17:47:51 <glenneth>	shom: you will be credited in the titles :)
Mar 05 17:48:07 <glenneth>	laters
Mar 05 17:48:26 <shom>	Oh gosh, please no. I don't want to be held responsible. Hahaha. 👋🏽

Mar 05 19:06:18 <sahil_1>	why am I getting the regular tab complete list in the minibuffer, and not vertico related popup. And is there any package like mason.nvim for emacs?
Mar 05 19:06:46 <Fade>	is vertico installed?
Mar 05 19:07:12 <sahil_>	yes
Mar 05 19:07:31 <sahil_>	vertico-mode enabled as well
Mar 05 19:07:56 <Fade>	are there any related messages in the messages or warnings buffers?
Mar 05 19:09:29 <sahil_>	nothing other than "Making completion list ..."
Mar 05 19:14:45 <Fade>	dunno. can you manually start it with M-x vertico-mode
Mar 05 19:14:45 <Fade>	?
Mar 05 19:26:13 <sahil_>	Fade: Yes (sorry for the delay)
Mar 05 19:26:21 <sahil_>	that's what I did to confirm 
Mar 05 19:26:38 <Fade>	something you installed is overriding the completion interface.
Mar 05 19:26:42 <Fade>	</guess>
Mar 05 19:28:06 <sahil_>	https://termbin.com/5726
Mar 05 19:28:06 <sahil_>	here is the config.

Mar 05 19:28:18 <sahil_>	some cleanup is required so don't judge
Mar 05 19:35:07 <Fade>	I don't think your org file is healthy. 
Mar 05 19:35:16 <Fade>	I just tried to tangle it and I'm getting a failure.
Mar 05 19:36:06 <Fade>	what is in init.el?
Mar 05 19:36:22 <Fade>	does org-babel-tangle-file work for you?
Mar 05 19:40:14 <benoitj>	hey Fade sahil_ 
Mar 05 19:40:48 <Fade>	I don't have the fonts or the theems to load this config.
Mar 05 19:41:06 <Fade>	I suggest you bisect the packages to find out what is overwriting your expected completion regime.
Mar 05 19:41:09 <Fade>	heya, benoitj 
Mar 05 19:41:45 <Fade>	sahil_: it's possible that the config isn't loading all the way through.
Mar 05 19:51:44 <sahil_>	Fade: let me check
Mar 05 19:52:44 <sahil_>	I see this warning https://termbin.com/2p0a But I don't think that it's fatal

Mar 05 19:53:38 <sahil_>	yes it tangled all the way through
Mar 05 19:54:21 <Fade>	that doesn't mean the resulting elisp file loaded correctly
Mar 05 19:54:30 <Fade>	considering we have some evidence that it hasn't.
Mar 05 19:54:33 <Marvin2>	considering we have a single pane
Mar 05 19:54:37 <Fade>	bisect the packages.
Mar 05 19:55:23 <sahil_>	Fade: at it

Mar 05 22:33:15 <Fade>	it's not ezzackly 'usable' by any modern standard even when it's functioning perfectly.
Mar 05 22:33:18 <Fade>	:)
Mar 05 22:33:24 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 05 22:33:56 <Fade>	but, if you have a lot of text to edit, and all you have is a teletype, it's just the thing.
Mar 05 22:36:23 <naokotani>	I thought there was a way to send all your inputs the the terminal buffer so you could use vim and seuch
Mar 05 22:37:05 <Fade>	vi(m) assumes a lot of terminal facilities that are not present prior to about 1977.
Mar 05 22:37:29 <naokotani>	prior of after?
Mar 05 22:38:44 <naokotani>	I thought I could use nvim in eat, but it doesn't appear overly usable
Mar 05 22:39:04 <naokotani>	it tells me the buffer is read only when im in normal mode
Mar 05 22:39:16 <naokotani>	but I can enter text in insert mode
Mar 05 22:39:37 <rdbeni0>	when I am in a rich emacs session, i.e. I have many buffers open, some of them are shell + ssh (vterm most often) and sometimes I need to quickly edit something remotely. nano/vim do not work properly with emacs shells, they can even lock up because of an input conflict. Hence the idea for `ed`
Mar 05 22:39:49 <Fade>	prior
Mar 05 22:41:13 <naokotani>	you can use tramp
Mar 05 22:41:29 <naokotani>	you can use tramp to open files in emacs buffers remotely, it works using ssh
Mar 05 22:41:32 <Marvin2>	you can check the bot's state :)
Mar 05 22:41:40 <naokotani>	yeah marvin, we know
Mar 05 22:42:04 <rdbeni0>	hmm, need to check how  to switch from vterm to tramp
Mar 05 22:42:23 <Fade>	just open the file using tramp syntax
Mar 05 22:43:00 <rdbeni0>	ok thanks for the idea, i will try
Mar 05 22:43:06 <Fade>	c-x c-f /ssh:rdbeni0@remotehost.com:/path/to/the/file/you/want/to/edit.org
Mar 05 22:43:41 <Fade>	or give it a path denoting a directory and emacs will open dired in that path.
Mar 05 22:44:36 <naokotani>	Tramp doesn't always work flawlessly, but I feel like its going ot be a better experience than ed, or nano for that matter
Mar 05 22:44:55 <naokotani>	I am sure there are so nano wizards out there that could prove me wrong though
Mar 05 22:45:03 <Fade>	i've seen you complain about tramp before, but I love it.
Mar 05 22:46:55 <rdbeni0>	ok,ok thanks guys. I had some issues with tramp in the past because it left some of his env manipulations in bash history, and our servers are monitored very strictly and I would like to avoid too "suspicious" commands in session history.
Mar 05 22:47:27 <rdbeni0>	but meaby i will recheck it now

Mar 06 02:13:32 <tdback>	nm0i: the second edition of the book is great too! I remember watching a presentation a few years back about awk and its impact on perl/ruby/etc. It sits right next to sed, grep, netcat, and a slew of others in my toolbox
Mar 06 02:13:36 <Marvin2>	nm0i: the second
Mar 06 02:14:28 <tdback>	I personally compile the onetrueawk instead of gawk, but that's just me being picky
Mar 06 02:14:31 <Marvin2>	I personally compile the onetrueawk instead of linkedin they would have damaged your mind.
Mar 06 02:14:51 <tdback>	Fade: Marvin2 is... evolving
Mar 06 03:39:14 <naokotani>	well, im the proud new owner of light mode

Mar 06 04:12:27 <naokotani>	oh just my blog
Mar 06 04:12:35 <naokotani>	i made light mode today fo rit
Mar 06 04:12:42 <naokotani>	and fixed some other crap css
Mar 06 04:17:20 <benoitj>	I think mine adjust to browser prefs

Mar 06 04:23:44 <naokotani>	ok, maybe I will try that then
Mar 06 04:23:45 <Marvin2>	ok, maybe I will see the point that it hasn't.
Mar 06 04:23:58 <benoitj>	probably going to watch it in the imax theater
Mar 06 04:24:21 <naokotani>	the nearest imax is like 3.5 hours away
Mar 06 04:24:59 <benoitj>	that is far
Mar 06 04:25:19 <benoitj>	cant have the view, the nature, and an imax theater :P
Mar 06 04:25:22 <Marvin2>	cant have the same time, I started practicing buddhism and I dont restart emacs often, so it doesn't become a crew member
Mar 06 04:25:29 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 06 04:25:32 <benoitj>	haha
Mar 06 04:25:56 <naokotani>	I started practicing buddhism and I don't restart emacs often should be on my tomb stone

Mar 06 04:26:51 <naokotani>	I can't recall why... oh
Mar 06 04:27:02 <naokotani>	I swticehd from zellij to tmux 14 hours ago
Mar 06 04:27:03 <benoitj>	reload your config is typically why I restart
Mar 06 04:27:15 <benoitj>	my other emacs is 7 days 7 hours
Mar 06 04:27:51 <naokotani>	and I usually end up running emacs in the terminal because..... otherwise it can't find the path
Mar 06 04:27:54 <naokotani>	because wsl
Mar 06 04:28:01 <benoitj>	oh
Mar 06 04:28:18 <benoitj>	when all you use is emacs, wsl is not too bad
Mar 06 04:28:40 <naokotani>	yeah
Mar 06 04:28:44 <naokotani>	I mean I use the terminal a lot
Mar 06 04:28:50 <benoitj>	ok
Mar 06 04:28:51 <naokotani>	and ssh for servers
Mar 06 04:29:03 <benoitj>	I use emacs a lot <--- emacs is my terminal
Mar 06 04:29:34 <naokotani>	I use them interchangeably
Mar 06 04:29:35 <benoitj>	since I used RDE, I got the habit of using emacs vterm. need to develop eshell too, but havent adopted it yet
Mar 06 04:29:48 <benoitj>	I have an old fork of st I still use
Mar 06 04:29:58 <benoitj>	but mostly to debug my emacs :P
Mar 06 04:30:10 <naokotani>	usually I edit files in emacs
Mar 06 04:30:47 <naokotani>	I find it a little faster to move around the filesystem in teh terminal
Mar 06 04:30:54 <naokotani>	though, overall I like dired
Mar 06 04:31:38 <benoitj>	yeah, dired is pretty good
Mar 06 04:31:57 <benoitj>	terminal + fzf is pretty nice
Mar 06 04:32:01 <naokotani>	I really like the dwim cp/mv
Mar 06 04:32:10 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 06 04:33:02 <naokotani>	and

Mar 06 05:38:46 <apoorv569>	Anybody else on Guix facing problem with `evil-mode` (Emacs) after recently Guix update (if managing emacs packages form Guix)?
Mar 06 05:40:04 <apoorv569>	I am having this problem where something happens to evil-mode where I can't go back to normal mode, to like scroll or move back and forward, I have to disable and enable evil-mode again to make it work.
Mar 06 05:40:34 <apoorv569>	And its like so frequent every other word I type make evil-mode crap out.
Mar 06 05:41:15 <apoorv569>	I don't see any errors, I just see this in message buffer,
Mar 06 05:41:23 <apoorv569>	Error running timer ‘corfu--auto-complete-deferred’: (wrong-number-of-arguments #<subr evil-normalize-keymaps> 4)
Mar 06 05:50:45 <glenneth>	hey apoorv569 
Mar 06 05:51:04 <benoitj>	tried running -Q and loading the module?
Mar 06 05:55:10 <apoorv569>	Hello glenneth
Mar 06 07:04:15 <apoorv569>	I ran `emacs` with `-Q`, then I `(require 'evil-core)` `(use-package evil-mode)`
Mar 06 07:04:37 <apoorv569>	It refuses to enable the mode. the module is loaded though.
Mar 06 07:10:50 <benoitj>	broken cache?
Mar 06 07:15:02 <apoorv569>	I'll clean my emacs cache one time to make sure.

Mar 06 08:01:34 <daviwil>	morning folks
Mar 06 08:14:21 <glenneth>	moshh: daviwil o/
Mar 06 08:17:32 <daviwil>	hey glenneth
Mar 06 08:33:05 <trev>	hi all
Mar 06 08:34:01 <daviwil>	hey trev
Mar 06 08:34:31 <trev>	daviwil: what are you up to? give us the insider sneak peek 
Mar 06 08:35:10 <daviwil>	working on a new design for the newsletter
Mar 06 08:35:26 <daviwil>	going to attempt a dual HTML/plain-text distribution
Mar 06 08:35:58 <daviwil>	start from an Org file, export plain HTML with simple styling and a text version similar to what I've been producing so far
Mar 06 08:43:26 <trev>	so you have to opt in to html or it somehow sends both?
Mar 06 08:43:53 <daviwil>	it will send both via separate MIME types, the e-mail client can choose which one to view
Mar 06 08:52:39 <glenneth>	hey trev o/
Mar 06 08:57:19 <trev>	hi glenneth 
Mar 06 09:16:48 <glenneth>	daviwil: so you can have an email client determine which version of an email to open?
Mar 06 09:18:08 <daviwil>	yep
Mar 06 09:18:34 <daviwil>	Discourse sends both HTML and plain text versions of its notification e-mails, you can set up mu4e or Notmuch to view the plain text version
Mar 06 09:18:50 <daviwil>	There was a discussion on the forum about it recently: https://forum.systemcrafters.net/t/plaintext-summary/222/8
Mar 06 09:18:56 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/xNfEd ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 06 09:19:21 <glenneth>	I did not know that.  I always assumed it was the sender that made that decision
Mar 06 09:19:26 <Marvin2>	I did make an effort to make money from home an they sold their house and toronto and got a working study on all the acronyms, bsc, msc, hlr, scp, they all means something to fix first, have a risc v board but I struggled with existential dread so I curled it to someone getting started on the seq abstraction, it makes it approachable
Mar 06 09:20:12 <daviwil>	In most cases, the sender just sends one type of content in an e-mail, but the e-mail protocol is flexible enough to contain different kinds of content if you know how to send it
Mar 06 09:20:13 <glenneth>	wow,  Marvin2 
Mar 06 09:21:11 <daviwil>	also, the Org publishing system is really flexible, but it's also really confusing until you understand the model
Mar 06 09:21:40 <glenneth>	cool.  I will read that post on the forum.  Haven't looked in a couple of days
Mar 06 09:47:36 <glenneth>	I just realised that HUGO sets an rss feed lol

Mar 06 11:31:45 <daviwil>	sent a first test email. it's clear I need to bump down the font size a little bit

Mar 06 11:35:17 <alternateved>	Text format hasn't been added yet!
Mar 06 11:35:34 <alternateved>	:D
Mar 06 11:35:54 <alternateved>	"This e-mail also provides text/plain content if you prefer it to HTML!""
Mar 06 11:35:56 <alternateved>	Lies!
Mar 06 11:42:09 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 06 11:42:56 <daviwil>	Lies for the moment :) 
Mar 06 11:43:05 <daviwil>	Need to write a custom text exporter 
Mar 06 11:49:23 <trev>	custom text exporter sounds like some fake tech
Mar 06 11:50:15 <trev>	i'm going to use that next time i have to explain something to a project manager 
Mar 06 11:59:58 <glenneth_>	Hey!! I'm a project manager! 
Mar 06 12:00:22 <glenneth_>	I think I killed my emacs session running listen.el
Mar 06 12:00:26 <alternateved>	Nice! Congratulations!
Mar 06 12:04:20 <glenneth_>	it may be updating the library. hard to tell. I'll give it ten minutes or so before I kill it
Mar 06 12:08:14 <trev>	glenneth_: hey, it turns out we can't use the default text exporter so i will need to write a custom one
Mar 06 12:08:41 <glenneth_>	sounds legit 🤣
Mar 06 12:11:17 <trev>	the bad news is that it's going to take me a few months
Mar 06 12:18:14 <daviwil>	trev: that is actually a good excuse, I mean who can argue with that?
Mar 06 12:19:23 <daviwil>	and if they ask further just say "have you ever dealt with grapheme clusters across Unicode byte widths?  trust me, this is a time consuming job"
Mar 06 12:21:23 <trev>	daviwil: "i found a bug in the unicode spec and i'm waiting for it to be resolved upstream"
Mar 06 12:29:37 <sahil_>	Doom emacs is way more smoother, compared to my own custom configured one.
Mar 06 12:32:47 <alternateved>	sahil_: What do you mean by way more smoother?
Mar 06 12:33:30 <sahil_>	alternateved: I opened a 10k lines file, and it was more responsive
Mar 06 12:33:40 <sahil_>	typing at 5000th line
Mar 06 12:34:35 <alternateved>	Most likely so-long-mode

Mar 06 12:36:06 <alternateved>	Did you try treesit btw?
Mar 06 12:36:58 <sahil_>	alternateved: I installed treesitter :) don't know if that's same as treesit.
Mar 06 12:38:21 <alternateved>	treesit is built-in
Mar 06 12:38:29 <alternateved>	tree-sitter is an external package
Mar 06 12:38:59 <alternateved>	More info here: https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter
Mar 06 12:39:01 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/bpQvq ]::[ How to Get Started with Tree-Sitter - Mastering Emacs ]
Mar 06 12:39:20 <alternateved>	I recommend treesit-auto package that automates all of that 
Mar 06 12:39:51 <alternateved>	But you would need to have Emacs compiled with tree-sitter support
Mar 06 12:40:15 <sahil_>	yes I found that when I searched treesit. Also doom actually seems better to get started with emacs, than custom config (I am using native-comp)
Mar 06 12:40:15 <alternateved>	treesit could help with your performance issues
Mar 06 12:40:57 <sahil_>	I will try to move my dev workflow to doom, if that works, I would be blessed 
Mar 06 12:41:05 <alternateved>	Yeah, if you don't know much about Emacs then Doom can be a good starting point (at the same time it could make things harder)
Mar 06 12:41:07 <Marvin2>	Yeah, if you are trying harder than I do not also do IT"
Mar 06 12:48:06 <trev>	why would treesitter help? is the lag most likely from the major-mode?
Mar 06 12:50:59 <alternateved>	I'm guessing that it might be caused by font-lock

Mar 06 14:10:48 <daviwil>	fully generated from an Org file
Mar 06 14:11:05 <alternateved>	Yay, no lies anymore 
Mar 06 14:11:24 <alternateved>	Seems nice. I appreciate source blocks :D
Mar 06 14:11:36 <daviwil>	font size is still too big in the Fastmail mobile app
Mar 06 14:14:57 <sahil_>	I am getting semgrep-ls errors whenever I connect to lsp in doom emacs. Had the same issue with rust-analyzer in my own config as well. Cansomeone explain?

Mar 06 14:24:47 <daviwil>	glenneth: thanks!  I'm pretty happy with it if I can just tame the fonts
Mar 06 14:26:27 <glenneth>	it all looks ok in mu4e and on my mobile 
Mar 06 14:26:34 <daviwil>	excellent
Mar 06 14:30:37 <alternateved>	Same for me in notmuch and on my mobile email client (FairEmail)
Mar 06 14:30:50 <daviwil>	awesome, thanks for the help!
Mar 06 14:31:27 <purplg>	hello everyone o/
Mar 06 14:31:55 <daviwil>	hey purplg
Mar 06 14:32:34 <purplg>	fastmail bestmail
Mar 06 14:33:26 <daviwil>	indeed
Mar 06 14:34:12 <purplg>	i also have been using Kagi recently. Did their trial for a short period and was sold very quickly
Mar 06 14:34:38 <purplg>	Who knew I'd pay for search one day lol
Mar 06 14:34:50 <purplg>	got tired of sifting through endless crap results
Mar 06 14:34:53 <glenneth>	hey purplg 
Mar 06 14:34:54 <daviwil>	when normal search is filled up with so much crap, you almost have to
Mar 06 14:35:07 <purplg>	glenneth: o/
Mar 06 14:36:30 <glenneth>	daviwil: using k-9 mail on mobile if that's relevant
Mar 06 14:37:35 <glenneth>	purplg: i think paying for search is inevitible
Mar 06 14:43:31 <alternateved>	purplg: I didn't have good local results with Kagi so for now I've switch back to ddg
Mar 06 14:44:00 <alternateved>	Also price tag for professional account is a tad too much for me
Mar 06 14:57:42 <purplg>	alternateved: yeah local results aren't great, but that's what !bang commands are for
Mar 06 15:02:59 <naokotani>	Does anyone know how to put the little github .svg badges into an org readme?
Mar 06 15:03:27 <naokotani>	I tried as a link and it just, i guess predictably, shows up as a link
Mar 06 15:03:57 <purplg>	i did it this way https://github.com/purplg/treebundel/blob/main/README.org?plain=1#L3
Mar 06 15:04:00 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/iWCiu ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 06 15:04:03 <purplg>	if that's what you're referring to
Mar 06 15:06:41 <alternateved>	purplg: if I have to use bang anyway than I don't see a point
Mar 06 15:07:23 <naokotani>	purplg: yeah thats it, trying to do a workflow/action one
Mar 06 15:07:26 <purplg>	alternateved: I ono, i love them. Used them in ddg all the time for various wikis or to just skip straight to google for some things
Mar 06 15:07:57 <alternateved>	yeah, really helpful also for checking documentation for various programming languages
Mar 06 15:08:25 <purplg>	also the !melpa bang works on kagi but not ddg :D
Mar 06 15:09:15 <alternateved>	Why would I need !melpa bang if I have `M-x list-packages` :D
Mar 06 15:09:17 <Marvin2>	Why would I be able to, but I see
Mar 06 15:09:39 <purplg>	alternateved: haha true, or better yet elpaca which has some nice features to browsing directly to the homepage :)
Mar 06 15:09:41 <Marvin2>	alternateved: haha true, or better yet elpaca which has a model that allows my body to extract information from it.
Mar 06 15:09:57 <purplg>	hmm
Mar 06 15:10:01 <alternateved>	lol Marvin2 
Mar 06 15:10:05 <purplg>	oops
Mar 06 15:10:07 <alternateved>	Good for your body I guess

Mar 06 15:18:00 <purplg>	is Marvin2 a bot?
Mar 06 15:18:17 <daviwil>	yep
Mar 06 15:18:22 <daviwil>	he's the village fool
Mar 06 15:18:28 <purplg>	I WAS SO CONFUSED 
Mar 06 15:18:29 <purplg>	lol
Mar 06 15:18:33 <purplg>	okay that makes sense
Mar 06 15:19:21 <purplg>	What happened to Marvin1?
Mar 06 15:20:29 <daviwil>	too dumb to survive
Mar 06 15:25:13 <benoitj>	morning folks

Mar 06 16:20:03 <benoitj>	hi Fade, Marvin2 
Mar 06 16:20:10 <Fade>	heya, benoitj 
Mar 06 16:40:52 <naokotani>	well, job interview went well aside from the guy having no idea what he's doing and having no money to pay anyone lol
Mar 06 16:40:55 <naokotani>	I want my hour back
Mar 06 16:41:04 <Fade>	uh...
Mar 06 16:41:18 <Fade>	why the hell is he interviewing people if he has no money for salary?
Mar 06 16:41:51 <naokotani>	Becuase he as been working on a website for 7 years and its a total mess
Mar 06 16:41:56 <naokotani>	and he wants someone to fix it
Mar 06 16:42:18 <Fade>	so you'd do this for free... why?
Mar 06 16:42:20 <Fade>	lol
Mar 06 16:43:07 <naokotani>	That's an excellent quetison. I can work on my own websites for free already.
Mar 06 16:43:21 <Fade>	what is the purpose of this site?
Mar 06 16:44:39 <naokotani>	https://onlinejobmarket.ca/
Mar 06 16:44:47 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/GCdwW ]::[ 2024 – Online Job Market – Simple. Innovative. Secure ]
Mar 06 16:44:49 <Fade>	lolirony
Mar 06 16:47:19 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 06 16:47:44 <naokotani>	he kept going on about "my queries are taking too long. I just want it to be json"
Mar 06 16:47:54 <Fade>	uh..
Mar 06 16:48:22 <naokotani>	then I ask more questions about the database and he mentions the user table has 100 fields
Mar 06 16:48:41 <trev>	lol
Mar 06 16:48:46 <trev>	run
Mar 06 16:48:50 <naokotani>	im like... how lol
Mar 06 16:49:01 <Fade>	mysql?
Mar 06 16:49:04 <Fade>	php?
Mar 06 16:49:08 <Fade>	(pain?)
Mar 06 16:49:12 <naokotani>	yeah its mysql
Mar 06 16:49:28 <naokotani>	IT seems like he's done whatever the polar opposite of database normalization is
Mar 06 16:49:29 <Fade>	does this site actually make any revenue?
Mar 06 16:49:45 <naokotani>	it doesn't sound like
Mar 06 16:49:56 <naokotani>	though, there isn't much competition in that market right?
Mar 06 16:49:58 <Marvin2>	though, there isn't much competition in that properties block on the plethora of good mornings that we are flustering marvin?
Mar 06 16:50:17 <Fade>	I doubt there are many jobs, either.
Mar 06 16:50:39 <naokotani>	if he were to pay me to fix it my first step would be to start over
Mar 06 16:50:56 <Fade>	you could probably 'fix' it by sorting out the database.
Mar 06 16:51:16 <naokotani>	yeah. that seems to be the crux of hte issue
Mar 06 16:51:19 <Marvin2>	yeah. that seems promsing. they want to make you feel better. Already a good point
Mar 06 16:51:46 <Fade>	heh
Mar 06 16:51:54 <Fade>	is it a php site?
Mar 06 16:51:54 <naokotani>	he also for some reasons showed me the php code in vi
Mar 06 16:51:56 <Marvin2>	he also for checking documentation for various programming languages
Mar 06 16:52:00 *	Fade laughs
Mar 06 16:52:18 <naokotani>	like. can we upgrade to vim?
Mar 06 16:52:18 <Fade>	this is a simple CRUD app.
Mar 06 16:52:25 <naokotani>	it is yeah
Mar 06 16:52:55 <Fade>	on the one hand, it'd be a simple matter of transliterating features from the old code in some saner stack with a better db schema
Mar 06 16:53:14 <Fade>	on the other, working for free is not really a winning move.
Mar 06 16:53:31 <naokotani>	no. Im confident I could fix it but im not owrking for free
Mar 06 16:53:36 <naokotani>	not for someone that knows less than me
Mar 06 16:53:41 <naokotani>	waste of time
Mar 06 16:53:57 <Fade>	php app, so all the pages are going to be custom one-off files
Mar 06 16:54:07 <Fade>	so templatizing everything would take some time.
Mar 06 16:54:24 <Fade>	then the interminable layout tweaking where the guy goes crazy about one pixel differences.
Mar 06 16:55:30 <naokotani>	well
Mar 06 16:55:36 <naokotani>	that shouldn't be too bad with php
Mar 06 16:55:38 <Marvin2>	that shouldn't
Mar 06 16:55:42 <Fade>	is he putting all the resumes into a field in the user table?
Mar 06 16:55:56 <naokotani>	probably
Mar 06 16:56:10 <naokotani>	fieds: id reusme1 resume2 resume3 resume4
Mar 06 16:56:19 *	Fade laughs
Mar 06 16:56:27 <naokotani>	like, literally has to be 
Mar 06 16:56:35 <Fade>	oh well, seven year old site bootstrapped by the non-technical owner who learned as he goes.
Mar 06 16:56:39 <Fade>	it's almost charming.
Mar 06 16:56:41 <naokotani>	to get a user that apperas on the frontend as 8 lines to have 100 fields
Mar 06 16:56:44 <Marvin2>	to get familiar with everything,but focused on one appointment last year.
Mar 06 16:57:40 <naokotani>	He is technical
Mar 06 16:57:47 <naokotani>	he explained his tech career
Mar 06 16:57:55 <naokotani>	he did basic on  the commodore!
Mar 06 16:58:04 <naokotani>	and then made this site
Mar 06 16:58:10 <Fade>	that's an auspicious place to start.
Mar 06 16:58:18 <Fade>	that's where I started.
Mar 06 16:58:23 <naokotani>	its great. just needs a bit flshed out in the middle part
Mar 06 16:58:44 <Fade>	anyhow, sorry about the bad lead.
Mar 06 16:59:13 <naokotani>	It's a bit defeating. I will forget about it in 2 weeks
Mar 06 16:59:31 <Fade>	does his site offer any other leads for you? :D
Mar 06 16:59:41 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 06 16:59:43 <naokotani>	good one
Mar 06 17:03:09 <Fade>	this website is shockingly slow.
Mar 06 17:04:00 <naokotani>	yes lol
Mar 06 17:04:05 <naokotani>	well he explained why
Mar 06 17:04:18 <naokotani>	its beause when you click think it questions the database. it should just be json
Mar 06 17:04:24 <Fade>	there are hardly any postings in the database.
Mar 06 17:04:59 <Fade>	searching IT jobs returns a posting for a veterinarian and a brick-layer.
Mar 06 17:05:05 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 06 17:05:14 <naokotani>	like i said
Mar 06 17:05:21 <naokotani>	my firs tstep would be to start over
Mar 06 17:05:42 <naokotani>	id keep his frontend and completely redo the backend
Mar 06 17:05:55 <naokotani>	his frontend is fine. it look a ibt dated but its whatever
Mar 06 17:06:16 <Fade>	the layout is bizarre. the page text is jammed up hard against the left margin.
Mar 06 17:06:46 <Fade>	anyhow, no point in doing free work in a hypothetical exmination of why you won't do free work. :D
Mar 06 17:06:47 <naokotani>	pretty sure looking at his css files would be like staring cthulu himself in the face
Mar 06 17:07:33 <Fade>	you could pitch him a project to deliver database optimisations
Mar 06 17:07:39 <Fade>	work it as a consulting gig.
Mar 06 17:08:14 <naokotani>	I thought about it, but if he has no money its not worth my time
Mar 06 17:08:22 <Fade>	definitely
Mar 06 17:09:04 <naokotani>	I directed him to my website and how it's instant
Mar 06 17:09:28 <naokotani>	like, your problem is not that its not "just in json"
Mar 06 17:09:44 <naokotani>	whatever that even means. 
Mar 06 17:10:14 <Fade>	i'm picturing a static site that loads serialized json data into in-memory storage when the page loads
Mar 06 17:10:16 <Marvin2>	i'm picturing a static site that loads serialized json data into in-memory storage when the inmates are running the asylum.
Mar 06 17:10:27 <Fade>	he only has about twenty job postings, so that would be really very fast.
Mar 06 17:10:29 <Marvin2>	he only knows what he witnesses. :)
Mar 06 17:10:40 <Fade>	i'm trying to imagine it scaling to a few thousand postings.
Mar 06 17:10:44 <naokotani>	very fast like
Mar 06 17:10:46 <naokotani>	3ms
Mar 06 17:11:32 <Fade>	sure
Mar 06 17:11:38 <Fade>	in-memory is a valid option
Mar 06 17:11:51 <Fade>	bu "just make it json" is not a valid architecture. :)
Mar 06 17:12:00 <naokotani>	yeah im ean i don't even know what he means
Mar 06 17:12:07 <naokotani>	well, yeah i have an idea
Mar 06 17:12:10 <naokotani>	some kind of caching
Mar 06 17:13:04 <Fade>	a postgres instance on the smallest available AWS vps would be fast enough to scale to tens of thousands of postings.
Mar 06 17:13:13 <Fade>	caching optimisations are... premature.
Mar 06 17:13:36 <Fade>	there are in-memory object storage solutions that incrementally perist, which is a valid approach.
Mar 06 17:13:41 <naokotani>	well lets see
Mar 06 17:14:04 <Fade>	did he explain that monstrous user table at all?
Mar 06 17:14:35 <naokotani>	you could describe it, idk if yo ucould explain it
Mar 06 17:15:25 <naokotani>	so I have a postgres server
Mar 06 17:15:35 <naokotani>	it has 1100 rows
Mar 06 17:15:47 <naokotani>	and my tests query it... idk
Mar 06 17:15:58 <naokotani>	500 times?
Mar 06 17:16:02 <naokotani>	my unit tests?
Mar 06 17:16:05 <naokotani>	it takes 10 seconds
Mar 06 17:16:25 <Fade>	Marvin is backed by a postgres database
Mar 06 17:16:29 <Fade>	!haiku
Mar 06 17:17:01 <Fade>	that command literally hits the chainer until it finds a spontaneous utterance that satisfies the syllabic structure of a haiku.
Mar 06 17:17:07 <Marvin2>	haiku:: and something we could / collaborate on to brush / up on the line up
Mar 06 17:17:48 <naokotani>	it questions 3 times once per level, so 1-20 and then once per difficulty and then I think does that again, but it does it twice per time
Mar 06 17:17:50 <Marvin2>	it questions 3 times a day since it ripped where screw holes are
Mar 06 17:18:04 <Fade>	ouch
Mar 06 17:18:15 <naokotani>	well it a testing
Mar 06 17:18:36 <Fade>	ten seconds is a long time for queries against a db that small.
Mar 06 17:18:52 <Fade>	I mean, I don't know the code or the table schema, but that's what my intuition says.

Mar 06 17:19:07 <Marvin2>	status:: I know 52,711 phrases.
Mar 06 17:19:48 <naokotani>	its query the database 900 times
Mar 06 17:20:59 <naokotani>	well, idk what portion of that is query and what portion is the rest of the logic
Mar 06 17:21:07 <Fade>	about 90 times a second?
Mar 06 17:21:17 <naokotani>	yeah
Mar 06 17:21:28 <Fade>	this is not what I'd expect in a modern system.
Mar 06 17:21:48 <Fade>	but if it satisfies the req as it sits, then the optimisation is premature. :)
Mar 06 17:23:08 <naokotani>	thast what
Mar 06 17:23:09 <naokotani>	100ms
Mar 06 17:23:24 <naokotani>	no, 10?
Mar 06 17:23:39 <Fade>	1000ms per second
Mar 06 17:24:03 <naokotani>	yeah 90 times 10 is 900
Mar 06 17:24:10 <naokotani>	so basically 10ms per test
Mar 06 17:24:27 *	Fade nods
Mar 06 17:24:30 <naokotani>	whatever 11ms
Mar 06 17:24:43 <naokotani>	sufficice to say, its orders of magnitude faster than what he has
Mar 06 17:25:06 <Fade>	the landing pages of that site take > 15 seconds to appear.
Mar 06 17:25:54 <naokotani>	eyah so even my unoptimized database would could do 1500 questions in that time
Mar 06 17:26:05 <naokotani>	queries idk why i keep typing questions lol
Mar 06 17:26:22 <naokotani>	the point is, his problem is not mysql
Mar 06 17:26:23 <Fade>	the terms are coloquially synonymous
Mar 06 17:33:35 <Fade>	doing pathological stuff wins pathological prizes.
Mar 06 17:33:59 <Fade>	too bad about the lead, but even if he had money this job would not bring you any pleasure at all.

Mar 06 17:56:37 <naokotani>	actaully
Mar 06 17:56:43 <naokotani>	I think the job looks fine
Mar 06 17:56:59 <naokotani>	fixing broken databases sounds fun tome
Mar 06 17:57:02 <naokotani>	its really the lack of money
Mar 06 17:57:09 <Fade>	the pushback on changes from the guy who built it all would be... formidable.
Mar 06 17:57:26 <Fade>	I have doubts, but you were there. perhaps you are right. :)
Mar 06 18:10:53 <naokotani>	well that's two seperate things
Mar 06 18:11:21 <naokotani>	dealing "that guy" (not fun) fixing a broken database/webiste (fun)
Mar 06 18:11:52 <naokotani>	thing one could very well suck much of if not all of the fun out of thing two
Mar 06 18:12:24 <Fade>	that was my analysis
Mar 06 18:12:41 <Fade>	but it's coloured by the fact that I hate pretty much every layer of the stack described.
Mar 06 18:12:50 <benoitj>	or if he's asking you for the wrong solutions
Mar 06 18:12:55 <Fade>	which is a personal thing.
Mar 06 18:13:43 <naokotani>	I think there is some sense to what he wants
Mar 06 18:13:44 <Fade>	(incf benoitj)
Mar 06 18:14:03 <naokotani>	I think he realizes it needs to be reworked, which is why he wants to remake it with react and pyhton
Mar 06 18:14:05 <Marvin2>	I think I did, everything was where I started.
Mar 06 18:14:15 <naokotani>	but he wants it to make money first so he can get money to rework it
Mar 06 18:14:22 <benoitj>	naokotani: what he want, what he asks, and what he needs are potentially opposite things
Mar 06 18:14:24 <Marvin2>	naokotani: what he witnesses. :)
Mar 06 18:14:53 <benoitj>	and that is not uncommon if you ask me
Mar 06 18:15:06 <benoitj>	lots of my work is to play in that field
Mar 06 18:15:18 <benoitj>	influence them to move closer to their needs
Mar 06 18:15:41 <naokotani>	capital
Mar 06 18:15:50 <naokotani>	seems to be priority one
Mar 06 18:16:14 <Fade>	the site performance is an existential threat to any capital.
Mar 06 18:16:24 <Fade>	he's going to have to pay to fix some of that first.
Mar 06 18:17:59 <naokotani>	I just feel like its not even a viable business
Mar 06 18:18:56 <naokotani>	if he sold me on the viability of the business I might consider it a bit more
Mar 06 18:19:26 <naokotani>	like. Does the world need Joe's neighrhood job board right now?
Mar 06 18:19:55 <naokotani>	anyway
Mar 06 18:20:00 <naokotani>	I have two options on my website
Mar 06 18:20:58 <naokotani>	I'm wrapping up the databse part and now I figure I can work on storage (probably some kind of s3 bucket type solution) or I can work on the REST api/frontend
Mar 06 18:21:56 <naokotani>	which should I do first and please give me a one sentence explanation why yo upicked it
Mar 06 18:23:02 <Fade>	I would do the API first, because that's more difficult.
Mar 06 18:23:13 <Fade>	api design is a deep subject.
Mar 06 18:23:25 <naokotani>	true
Mar 06 18:23:47 <naokotani>	and its also a piece of the database because I am going ot need to figure out login/accounts etc.
Mar 06 18:24:19 <Fade>	also, once you have defined the API, I can get Marvin to talk to it. :D
Mar 06 18:24:31 <naokotani>	uh oh
Mar 06 18:24:32 <naokotani>	how is that?
Mar 06 18:24:42 <Fade>	this is the pathfinder thing?
Mar 06 18:24:52 <Fade>	!roll 1 6
Mar 06 18:24:54 <Marvin2>	roll:: You roll 1 d6... the roll is 3!
Mar 06 18:24:57 <naokotani>	no its my tabletop rpg assets ecommerce store
Mar 06 18:25:06 <naokotani>	selling pdfs, maps, tokens
Mar 06 18:25:20 <Fade>	maybe not, in that case. 
Mar 06 18:25:23 <Marvin2>	maybe not, in that properties block on the rss discovery thing is it's run with a width under 70 chars and the links to point to the summit?
Mar 06 18:26:07 <naokotani>	but feel free to have marvin talk to the pathfinder hting
Mar 06 18:26:13 <naokotani>	its.. well im calling it done
Mar 06 18:26:18 <naokotani>	for now anyway
Mar 06 18:28:55 <Fade>	cool
Mar 06 18:29:24 <naokotani>	in a perfect world
Mar 06 18:29:36 <naokotani>	you would click on the monsters and it would open a modal with their attributes
Mar 06 18:29:55 <naokotani>	but that would require a lot more web scraping than I care to deal with right now
Mar 06 18:46:53 <Fade>	it might be easier to take apart the pdf files of the various books.
Mar 06 18:46:58 <sektor>	Howdy.
Mar 06 18:47:03 <Fade>	heya, sektor 
Mar 06 18:48:51 <naokotani>	take apart the pdf files of the varoius books?
Mar 06 18:49:09 <naokotani>	oohhh
Mar 06 18:49:18 <naokotani>	yeah you might be right actually
Mar 06 18:49:22 <naokotani>	I didn't htink of that
Mar 06 18:49:24 <Marvin2>	I didn't do anything :]
Mar 06 18:49:39 <naokotani>	the problem is the website is.... well, kind of random
Mar 06 18:49:57 <Fade>	the bestiary has a regular structure.
Mar 06 18:49:59 <naokotani>	it seems like the page for each of the 1000 plus monsters was hand written
Mar 06 18:50:27 <naokotani>	so its hard to use tags/classes/ids to selec things because its not consistent
Mar 06 18:50:43 *	Fade nods
Mar 06 18:51:40 <naokotani>	or who knows. if I didn't want someoen web scraping my stuff idk make three slightly different templates and use a random number generator to pick one each tim elol
Mar 06 18:51:49 <naokotani>	just to really drive them bananas
Mar 06 18:52:22 <Fade>	I would use the lisp condition system to handle that situation
Mar 06 18:52:34 <Fade>	of course, it would in the worst case increase the load on the server 3x.
Mar 06 18:52:37 <Fade>	:)
Mar 06 18:53:07 <naokotani>	the hard part would be figuring out what was going on without access to the server
Mar 06 18:53:09 <Marvin2>	the hard part would be to start doing taxes myself is the most important one, ashraz!
Mar 06 18:53:30 <Fade>	i'd just get the page and run a parsing pass over it.
Mar 06 18:53:31 <naokotani>	if you knew the pattern hwat was going on it would be easy enough
Mar 06 18:54:06 <Fade>	web scraping is a real tarpit
Mar 06 18:54:29 <Fade>	it works very well, for a long or a short time, and then fails in fairly unkowable but spectacular ways. 
Mar 06 18:54:50 <naokotani>	well
Mar 06 18:54:54 <naokotani>	this would be a one and done
Mar 06 18:55:07 <naokotani>	I guess in theory if they added more books id want to get tha tdata

Mar 06 18:57:00 <Acyrsa>	Hi guys, I'm having a problem with lsp and ruby-mode, anyone can help me to fix this?
Mar 06 18:57:00 <Fade>	ciao
Mar 06 18:57:24 <Fade>	Acyrsa: ask and find out. I probably won't be much help. :)
Mar 06 18:58:42 <Acyrsa>	When I start ruby-mode it start rubocop-ls server. I need to start solargraph server but I don't know how I can choose or change server priority
Mar 06 19:00:28 <naokotani>	maybe check eglot-server-programs
Mar 06 19:00:49 <naokotani>	its a variable
Mar 06 19:00:58 <naokotani>	assuming you are using eglot
Mar 06 19:01:33 <naokotani>	it takes a list of modes and programs to associate
Mar 06 19:01:44 <naokotani>	ok this time im for real taking the puppy for a walk
Mar 06 19:01:51 <Acyrsa>	I'm using lsp-mode
Mar 06 19:02:33 <naokotani>	Ah. I used to use that but they added elgot ot emacs 29 so I swtiched. not sure how with lsp mode, but I bet its something very similar
Mar 06 19:02:35 <Marvin2>	Ah. I thought you had to actually stop my server and rsync them to come back. Well, good lucky being a chipper yoga teacher
Mar 06 19:03:51 <naokotani>	or did they add it in 28?

Mar 06 19:08:57 <benoitj>	you may have both installed
Mar 06 19:09:19 <Acyrsa>	how I can uninstall one of them?
Mar 06 19:09:22 <benoitj>	there must be a variable to use to select which lsp to use

Mar 06 20:27:19 <SummerEmacs>	what did i miss?
Mar 06 20:28:06 <benoitj>	SummerEmacs: everything
Mar 06 20:28:08 <benoitj>	hey
Mar 06 20:28:13 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi
Mar 06 20:28:18 <SummerEmacs>	anything new?
Mar 06 20:28:19 <benoitj>	on a call, will be away for some time
Mar 06 20:28:22 <Marvin2>	on a call. You use arco and then the struct goes out of the arch desktop
Mar 06 20:28:23 <SummerEmacs>	i know it's been a long time
Mar 06 20:28:26 <SummerEmacs>	oh ok.
Mar 06 20:28:31 <SummerEmacs>	hi Marvin2
Mar 06 20:28:37 <benoitj>	welcome back :)
Mar 06 20:28:41 <SummerEmacs>	ty!
Mar 06 20:29:10 <SummerEmacs>	hi Fade
Mar 06 20:29:27 <SummerEmacs>	hi mretka daviwil alternateved fyrfaras glenneth
Mar 06 20:29:31 <SummerEmacs>	ping!
Mar 06 20:29:44 <benoitj>	need to teach Marvin2 some bear stuff
Mar 06 20:30:00 <SummerEmacs>	he's a bot i'm guessing
Mar 06 20:30:16 <SummerEmacs>	it's been like forever since i was here fr
Mar 06 20:33:46 <morganw>	SummerEmacs: For the question you posted on reddit about problems with autosave when org mode files have / in them, I would guess that you have some kind of hook which looks to update org process cookies.  So the problem would not be the autosave settings, but rather something that is automatically trying to update the files.
Mar 06 20:33:49 <Marvin2>	SummerEmacs: For the bot some kind of reasuring these old systems don't really use it
Mar 06 20:34:27 <SummerEmacs>	morganw: ty i forgot about that. a lot has happened since then. 🙃 i'll go back and check my config soon.
Mar 06 20:34:29 <Marvin2>	morganw: ty i forgot if you ask me
Mar 06 20:35:07 <morganw>	You might be able to find something calling the org-update-parent-todo-statistics function, as that would be looking for progress cookies.
Mar 06 20:35:09 <Marvin2>	You might need to apply to that specific folder?
Mar 06 20:35:18 <SummerEmacs>	lemme check
Mar 06 20:35:26 <SummerEmacs>	i'm just getting comfy on my couch
Mar 06 20:36:09 <SummerEmacs>	i found this: https://0x0.st/H76Y.txt
Mar 06 20:36:14 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/HYToV ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 06 20:37:36 <morganw>	That may be it.  It doesn't really make sense to do the update *after* saving, so the latest version of the file be not be saved, and you will have autosave files to cover you in the mean time.
Mar 06 20:38:12 <SummerEmacs>	so just comment out that block?
Mar 06 20:38:36 <morganw>	You can probably just change it to use before-save-hook instead.
Mar 06 20:39:01 <morganw>	Or comment it out, just to see if this fixes it first.
Mar 06 20:39:53 <SummerEmacs>	ok gimme a few 
Mar 06 20:40:08 <SummerEmacs>	we have a group discuss atm abt what to watch
Mar 06 20:41:09 <SummerEmacs>	ok gonna restart emacs

Mar 06 20:42:41 <SummerEmacs>	tysm!

Mar 06 21:07:23 <BigEatie>	Anyone on EXWM? Do you guys have a trick to get popup windows to open (i.e. attachments on email)?

Mar 06 21:08:58 <BigEatie>	Even in floating mode I can't get anything to show...odd
Mar 06 21:09:11 <morganw>	BigEatie: I use it sometimes.  Normally when programs open I just let it take over the current window, but I do have a keymapping to toggle back and forth between two windows.
Mar 06 21:09:14 <Marvin2>	BigEatie: I was born in scotland, but where did that come from
Mar 06 21:09:40 <morganw>	If nothing shows then maybe the program is failing to start, or the handler for opening the attachment is not working.
Mar 06 21:10:53 <morganw>	If your computer is particularly slow like mine, you can also use the mouse focus to steer the new program to a target window.
Mar 06 21:13:12 <SummerEmacs>	sorry i got drafted to play guitar on the second round
Mar 06 21:13:33 <SummerEmacs>	i had to tune it up first real quick

Mar 06 21:25:40 <SummerEmacs>	i was traveling
Mar 06 21:25:47 <SummerEmacs>	like 7 different time zones this last trip
Mar 06 21:25:52 <SummerEmacs>	something like that
Mar 06 21:26:18 <BiggerEatier>	That's a reasonable explanation too

Mar 06 22:07:54 <benoitj>	:D
Mar 06 22:08:13 <Fade>	Marvin1 was defeated because he was written in python
Mar 06 22:08:25 <Fade>	Marvin2's kung fu is much stronger.
Mar 06 22:08:50 <benoitj>	python ate Marvin1 then
Mar 06 22:11:40 <Fade>	it's surprisingly difficult in the early noughts to write server software in straight python.
Mar 06 22:11:55 <Fade>	the parallelization story not so great. corners had to be cut.
Mar 06 22:15:00 <SummerEmacs>	Fade: btw you been ok?

Mar 06 22:16:22 <SummerEmacs>	true it kinda felt like it

Mar 06 22:22:16 <SummerEmacs>	i just heard rob reiner talk about it on a podcast

Mar 06 22:25:06 <SummerEmacs>	yeah it's really really good
Mar 06 22:25:09 <Marvin2>	yeah it's fun
Mar 06 22:25:37 <SummerEmacs>	that's how i play it too just with the feeling and flow it's a solo so it's basically a cadenza but for the guitar and it's the whole song.
Mar 06 22:25:40 <Marvin2>	that's how i can create objects, define classes in clojure, but the xml has to be the place to be able to see how the pdfs look when I got interested in Void, but haven't gotten much use outta it
Mar 06 22:25:41 <benoitj>	I know the original funkadelic one
Mar 06 22:25:43 <SummerEmacs>	it's got some staples and the rest is up to you

Mar 06 22:28:05 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 06 22:28:32 <Fade>	I like how he uses the line cliches from the original to anchor his exposition.
Mar 06 22:28:35 <SummerEmacs>	yea
Mar 06 22:28:37 <SummerEmacs>	that's what i do
Mar 06 22:28:51 <SummerEmacs>	you don't play a song like this according to sheet music 😀 
Mar 06 22:29:06 <Fade>	it's an extended pentatonic solo
Mar 06 22:29:12 <SummerEmacs>	if you need sheet music to play this song, you don't know enough to really play this song.

Mar 06 22:30:40 <SummerEmacs>	i can
Mar 06 22:31:02 <Fade>	you're fortunate
Mar 06 22:31:12 <SummerEmacs>	i learned when i was like 3 or 4

Mar 06 22:37:53 <Fade>	I love some stuff from the eighties, but as a 'genre' it was a little weak compared to the previous twenty years. :)
Mar 06 22:38:08 <SummerEmacs>	my dad taught me at an early age all about the great era of the solo guitar. lying down on the floor with him and blasting it through the speakers with our eyes closed.
Mar 06 22:38:14 <SummerEmacs>	taking a trip into the music
Mar 06 22:38:32 <Fade>	nice
Mar 06 22:38:36 <benoitj>	I called this "watching the ceiling" :)
Mar 06 22:38:49 <SummerEmacs>	he explained it's what they used to do before the internet 😀 
Mar 06 22:38:57 <SummerEmacs>	and that's why they had such amazing music
Mar 06 22:38:58 <Fade>	I spent a _lot_ of time actively listening to music over the years.
Mar 06 22:39:02 <SummerEmacs>	because that was everything to them

Mar 06 22:41:43 <SummerEmacs>	i didn't know that

Mar 07 02:49:54 <cow_2001>	i wanna write a guile meditation and hiit alarm clock and tracker :|
Mar 07 02:50:19 <cow_2001>	how hard would it be to actually learn how to write gnome / gtk software? :|
Mar 07 02:51:15 <cow_2001>	every time i tried learning GUI programming it kind of petered out
Mar 07 03:29:05 <tdback>	cow_2001: KDE just dropped with Qt6, you could write it for that!
Mar 07 03:29:42 <tdback>	Although I'm not sure if that's heavier than gtk...
Mar 07 03:30:21 <visl>	i haven't done it in awhile but the hardest thing was whatever they call the algorithms for positioning elements
Mar 07 03:32:31 <cow_2001>	tdback: I've got a question for you:  What's heavier, a gigabytte of Gnome or a gigabytte of KDE? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ris5lVssz8
Mar 07 03:32:34 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/VDQHJ ]::[ Limmy's Show   Kilogramme - YouTube ]
Mar 07 03:32:38 <visl>	you make a box with a a grid that has a 2 list and a stack to get your widgets in the correct spot.
Mar 07 03:32:41 <Marvin2>	you make a command to automate thanking Marvin
Mar 07 03:33:53 <tdback>	cow_2001: that was hilarious
Mar 07 03:34:12 <cow_2001>	limmy's show was genius
Mar 07 03:34:17 <tdback>	"That's right, it's a Gnome, because Gnome is heavier than KDE"
Mar 07 03:34:45 <cow_2001>	nothing when guix search guile qt ~_~
Mar 07 03:35:10 <cow_2001>	seems like there are no many guile wrapper
Mar 07 03:35:45 <tdback>	try writing your own?
Mar 07 03:35:52 <tdback>	that would be a bit of an endeavor
Mar 07 03:35:54 <Marvin2>	that would require a method in the thumbnail
Mar 07 03:36:07 <cow_2001>	i wouldn't even know how
Mar 07 03:36:09 <Marvin2>	i wouldn't go that far. :)
Mar 07 03:37:06 <cow_2001>	i wrote some patches for some existing rustlang library once
Mar 07 03:37:20 <tdback>	create a new repo, someone else sees it, then they take over the project for you. boom done. open source for the win
Mar 07 03:37:27 <cow_2001>	it was a strange C++ to C to Rustlang wrapping
Mar 07 03:37:36 <tdback>	sounds complicated
Mar 07 03:38:39 <cow_2001>	i mean, you'd write a c library with some wrapping functions which imports and uses c++ library and then import and wrap the c library from rustlang

Mar 07 13:20:59 <alternateved>	Lately I was seeing really elaborate meow configurations
Mar 07 13:21:43 <alternateved>	it makes me want to give meow another try (I don't use modal editing for quite some time now)
Mar 07 13:21:46 <trev>	is that a set of keybindings?
Mar 07 13:21:49 <Marvin2>	is that those communities there is a Scheme hacker
Mar 07 13:22:43 <alternateved>	trev: not necessarily - it can be defined fully by you.

Mar 07 13:32:04 <trev>	rust-analyzer
Mar 07 13:32:19 <trev>	alternateved: i wasn't impressed by kakoune or helix style editing 
Mar 07 13:32:47 <trev>	the explanation to why it's better isn't convincing enough
Mar 07 13:33:07 <alternateved>	What matters here is that meow better integrates with vanilla Emacs and doesn't need that much of glue like evil does
Mar 07 13:33:10 <Marvin2>	What matters here is the borrow checker a complile time language server?
Mar 07 13:33:13 <trev>	maybe it's only "better" for non-vimmers
Mar 07 13:33:26 <naokotani>	rust anaylzer doesn't automatically restart my web server
Mar 07 13:33:56 <trev>	yeah evil definitely is too much glue, but isn't that the entirety of emacs? 😂
Mar 07 13:34:19 <trev>	Linus called it "gummed up" or something lol
Mar 07 13:34:42 <trev>	naokotani: oh right
Mar 07 13:35:16 <daviwil>	i love gum
Mar 07 13:35:30 <naokotani>	can set it to do cargo watch -x clippy -x test -x run
Mar 07 13:35:45 <naokotani>	its nice for making smaller changes
Mar 07 13:36:34 <naokotani>	so far this book is really good. I am learnng a lot. it is very practical in regards to testing and setting up ci/cd stuff
Mar 07 13:38:12 <naokotani>	I was completely at a loss on how to do integration tests before, but he moves the actual actix code to a lib.rs and then tests it as a lib. never would have thought to do that
Mar 07 13:38:15 <Marvin2>	I was already paying them for the hint
Mar 07 13:39:21 <naokotani>	im excited to see how he tests database stuff, but alas I am stuck in linux class
Mar 07 13:46:58 <sahil_>	All the sudden, 2-3 days ago, my brave browser stopped showing the file picker dialog.
Mar 07 13:47:31 <sahil_>	So does the chromium. With firefox it works. Does anyone know what this might be?
Mar 07 13:48:43 <trev>	i'm stuck in linux too since daviwil won't make a video on how to install windows 11
Mar 07 13:49:21 <sahil_>	He doesn't make videos on how to be used, or does he?

Mar 07 13:54:45 <alternateved>	let's go
Mar 07 13:55:34 <naokotani>	paying 200 dollars for windows is like paying for a newpaper full of adds
Mar 07 13:55:52 <trev>	they're guaranteeing improved productivity and focus 
Mar 07 13:56:04 <sahil_>	It works now. I had to remove some xdg-desktop-portal-smth (gnome/gtk). I tried multiple wms and DEs , and it bit me back
Mar 07 13:56:39 <naokotani>	its actually just kde plasma and they slap windows bloatware on it
Mar 07 13:57:03 <naokotani>	and turn off all the best features
Mar 07 13:57:17 <sahil_>	And track all your keypresses
Mar 07 13:57:54 <trev>	they're just saving all my keypresses for later in case i need them!
Mar 07 13:57:56 <Marvin2>	they're just saving all my paperwork yet
Mar 07 13:58:42 <naokotani>	trev makes fun of me for using windows meanwhile he is a slave to Bram Moolenar

Mar 07 14:00:11 <davd33>	naokotani: what does "o/" mean?
Mar 07 14:00:14 <daviwil>	so much to unpack in that exchange

Mar 07 14:35:08 <morganw>	I was hoping to get a feel for the original experience before piling on the plug-ins.
Mar 07 14:36:21 <trev>	morganw: you can open with `nvim .` and use the netrw to navigate around the directory and open files into new buffers
Mar 07 14:36:23 <Marvin2>	morganw: you were an atheist
Mar 07 14:36:23 <alternateved>	I think https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/blob/master/init.lua is a good starting point

Mar 07 14:36:57 <naokotani>	and how you want to approach your own configuration
Mar 07 14:39:54 <morganw>	In terms of language support, if you don't rely on plugins/LSP, do you only get syntax highlighting and have to operate purely with standard motions and text objects, or is there a way to declare what the language constructs look like and operate on those?
Mar 07 14:39:56 <Marvin2>	In terms of octal components?
Mar 07 14:40:27 <morganw>	e.g. Where would someone define a function which selects the function around the cursor?
Mar 07 14:40:30 <trev>	shut UP Marvin2 
Mar 07 14:41:10 <trev>	morganw: treesitter is builtin now but requires a few extra plugins to make it useful. that can help with motions for structural editing
Mar 07 14:41:49 <trev>	there is no s-exp fanciness like in emacs out of the box
Mar 07 14:42:40 <morganw>	So traditionally people just moved around blocks by paragraphs or ([{ ?
Mar 07 14:43:23 <morganw>	Or maybe by identation level for python.
Mar 07 14:43:58 <trev>	yeah that is a pretty common way

Mar 07 16:15:31 <alternateved>	I replace built-in grep with ripgrep
Mar 07 16:16:05 <alternateved>	https://git.sr.ht/~alternateved/dotemacs/tree/main/item/init.el#L148
Mar 07 16:16:09 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/zExAA ]::[ ~alternateved/dotemacs (main): init.el - sourcehut git ]
Mar 07 16:17:00 <alternateved>	really handy, since you need to confirm input with project-find-regexp
Mar 07 16:17:13 <alternateved>	and consult-ripgrep gives you live preview
Mar 07 16:17:43 <naokotani>	do you ever undo 80 million times and then think, damn I should have raised that cap a bit?
Mar 07 16:18:25 <alternateved>	if I have to undo 80 million times then I vundo
Mar 07 16:19:22 <naokotani>	Intereting. never heard of this one
Mar 07 16:19:52 <alternateved>	simple thing but gives you a visual image of your undoing
Mar 07 16:20:05 <alternateved>	really helpful in those situations
Mar 07 16:20:07 <glenneth>	before i go a-googling.  What is a REST api?       
Mar 07 16:20:14 <naokotani>	yeah thats really cool. especially if you don't have it in git
Mar 07 16:20:37 <naokotani>	its a methodology for making APIs
Mar 07 16:20:46 <naokotani>	that is common used for web apis
Mar 07 16:21:24 <glenneth>	thanks naokotani 
Mar 07 16:21:41 <naokotani>	what do you need a rest api for?
Mar 07 16:21:47 <glenneth>	seems i need to read more :)
Mar 07 16:22:15 <glenneth>	I'm not sure i do just yet
Mar 07 16:24:05 <naokotani>	oh is this for your blog?
Mar 07 16:24:58 <BigEatie>	daviwil: Some of the colors are a bit difficult to see on a white background on the new newsletter, i.e.: https://0x0.st/H77u.png
Mar 07 16:25:01 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/grooq ]::[ Binary data ]
Mar 07 16:25:01 <glenneth>	no.  trying to get Nyxt browser to behave how i want it to 
Mar 07 16:25:34 <glenneth>	BigEatie: dark mode :D
Mar 07 16:25:35 <daviwil>	BigEatie: yikes. Is this Gmail? My wife told me the background color isn't working there either 
Mar 07 16:26:14 <BigEatie>	Yea, that's gmail.
Mar 07 16:26:48 <daviwil>	Gmail loves to do it's own thing 
Mar 07 16:31:04 <daviwil>	naokotani: the code block outline is a feature of the ox-ascii exporter for Org files 
Mar 07 16:32:20 <daviwil>	Check out my hacked up exporter code here: https://codeberg.org/SystemCrafters/systemcrafters-site/src/branch/master/newsletter.el

Mar 07 16:42:54 <BigEatie>	daviwil: I think it's useful to see this kind of stuff -- always wondered how people were getting such custom looking websites from org mode with things like headers and footers (and sidebars, though I can't get mine to work 🤦🏾‍♀️
Mar 07 16:44:26 <naokotani>	yeah. the way the header is formatted is quite interesting
Mar 07 16:45:20 <naokotani>	I've just been using html source blocks or things like that
Mar 07 16:45:53 <BigEatie>	I feel like for generating a single page of content that's probably easier.
Mar 07 16:46:37 <naokotani>	Yeah. I think you could use macros to do it
Mar 07 16:46:41 <naokotani>	org macros
Mar 07 16:47:14 <naokotani>	but I just have a template that I use and I fill in the information per page
Mar 07 16:47:21 <Fade>	Good Morning
Mar 07 16:47:21 <trev>	Fade: good morning
Mar 07 16:47:29 *	Fade peers at trev
Mar 07 16:47:42 <Fade>	somebody has been scripting their irc client.
Mar 07 16:47:43 <BigEatie>	Didn't know about org macros. Been using yas-snippets for that kind of thing
Mar 07 16:47:46 <Marvin2>	Didn't know that. I normally just set `project-switch-project` to `magit-status` or something like that
Mar 07 16:47:55 <BigEatie>	Howdy Fade, trev 
Mar 07 16:47:55 <trev>	BigEatie: howdy
Mar 07 16:48:27 <Fade>	fellas
Mar 07 16:48:45 <naokotani>	say you have a speicifc letterhead with information that y ou want to be consistent youc an make a file to define the macros and then import it. its pretty handy
Mar 07 16:49:23 <BigEatie>	Ahh, and then if you want to switch it up in the future you just change the single file?
Mar 07 16:49:32 <naokotani>	yes
Mar 07 16:49:39 <BigEatie>	Cool, I'll check that out
Mar 07 16:49:53 <naokotani>	there are ssoooooo many ways to skin a cat
Mar 07 16:50:20 <Fade>	infinite ways
Mar 07 16:50:47 <BigEatie>	The infinite is possible at zombocom
Mar 07 16:50:49 <Fade>	I always wanted to name a project "rube goldberg's cat"
Mar 07 16:54:59 <Fade>	step1: place a lens in a window such that: step2: earth rotates the lens eventually putting the head of a match in the focal point of the lens such that: step3 match ignites...
Mar 07 16:56:37 <Fade>	I think I need a brain transplant.
Mar 07 17:00:01 <trev>	Fade: heheh 
Mar 07 17:01:14 <trev>	Fade: step4, light cat on fire
Mar 07 17:05:24 <Fade>	well, by step3 I have already recapitulated emacs, so at that point the steps become arbitrary. :)
Mar 07 17:06:11 <Fade>	the rube goldberg machine has become turing complete.
Mar 07 17:23:29 <Fade>	in other news, nyxt is becoming increasingly awesome.
Mar 07 17:23:53 <Fade>	it didn't crash once on me in about eight hours of use yesterday.
Mar 07 17:28:23 <BigEatie>	I'll have to give it another try, I really like the concept but last few times I tried it didn't offer enough to move me away from qutebrowser.\
Mar 07 17:30:32 <Fade>	i've been treating it as its own thing. it does a bunch of stuff other browsers don't
Mar 07 17:30:46 <Fade>	my main issue is that it tends to lock up on me until quite recently.
Mar 07 17:37:53 <BigEatie>	So what you're saying is it's a great OS without a decent browser?
Mar 07 17:41:08 <daviwil>	I'm due for another trial run of Nyxt
Mar 07 17:41:20 <daviwil>	Until I make a Scheme browser in anger :) 
Mar 07 17:42:06 <Fade>	let's not lisp curse our way to snatching defeat from the jaws of victory! 
Mar 07 17:42:09 *	Fade laughs
Mar 07 17:42:11 <daviwil>	Actually, now that Hoot exists... 
Mar 07 17:42:30 <daviwil>	Fade: nah, this is the Lisp way :) 
Mar 07 17:42:55 <Fade>	I've been here quite awhile, and have begun to suspect that might be part of the reason why we don't actually rule the world.
Mar 07 17:43:05 <naokotani>	I just spent like an hour helping a classmate fix his broken java sdk install and it has confirmed my suspicion I don't want to do tech support for a living
Mar 07 17:43:08 <Marvin2>	I just use the javascript reply quite a while since I was cured of catholicism, I found no need for the newsletter
Mar 07 17:43:34 <Fade>	tech support is the widest stage of the career funnel into IT.
Mar 07 17:44:06 <glenneth>	Marvin2: on point :D
Mar 07 17:44:25 <naokotani>	Fade: oh cool. I think I saw a discount on valium on amazon
Mar 07 17:44:37 <daviwil>	That may be Marvin2's best post yet 
Mar 07 17:45:24 <naokotani>	yeah daviwil I was didn't want to break your heart and tell you i don't read the newletter because im not catholic
Mar 07 17:45:44 <alternateved>	same
Mar 07 17:45:46 <daviwil>	My catholic newsletter is not gonna convert anybody to Emacs 
Mar 07 17:46:31 <Fade>	there's a south african pastor making emacs video on youtube.
Mar 07 17:46:33 <glenneth>	cured of catholicism.  stored for future retrieval
Mar 07 17:46:55 <Fade>	the bot was aping me, I think.
Mar 07 17:47:24 <Fade>	foolish process.
Mar 07 17:47:31 <daviwil>	Ahh yeah, Emacs Elements, nice guy 
Mar 07 17:47:48 <naokotani>	Fade: but if I did tech support what would stop me from ending um in a hellish samsara of fixng poeples printer?
Mar 07 17:48:06 <Fade>	he is. I wouldn't have known he was a pastor if he hadn't shown an org buffer list with a bunch of ecclesiatical files in it.
Mar 07 17:48:15 <glenneth>	I like his videos
Mar 07 17:48:20 <naokotani>	who is a preacher?
Mar 07 17:48:25 <daviwil>	If you look at his bookshelf it is filled with religious books 
Mar 07 17:48:26 <naokotani>	pastor*
Mar 07 17:48:28 <Marvin2>	If you want your project build to use sourcehut instead of what the compiler and the us
Mar 07 17:48:59 <naokotani>	oh emacs elemetns. never heard of him
Mar 07 17:49:01 <Fade>	naokotani: Emacs Elements on youtube.
Mar 07 17:49:01 <Marvin2>	oh emacs elemetns. never heard of this started
Mar 07 17:49:07 <daviwil>	I'm a pastor of the satanic church of Emacs
Mar 07 17:49:17 <Fade>	ditto brother.
Mar 07 17:50:03 <naokotani>	I was learning about Satanism
Mar 07 17:50:07 <naokotani>	the other day
Mar 07 17:50:26 <naokotani>	its basically just classical liberalism but dressed up to get the kids excited about it
Mar 07 17:50:42 <Fade>	I actually joined the satanic temple in self defence.
Mar 07 17:50:50 <daviwil>	naokotani: basically 
Mar 07 17:51:01 <daviwil>	LARPing for Satan
Mar 07 17:51:28 <daviwil>	Once you read about Hatha Toilet Seat Meditation, you know you're in Looney Town
Mar 07 17:51:31 <naokotani>	honestly whatever gets people on board with the enlightenment is ok in my books even if it is a few hundred years behind schedule
Mar 07 17:51:33 <Fade>	it's super useful when the holy rollers start getting feverish in your political dmesne.
Mar 07 17:52:32 <naokotani>	The holler rollers here are pretty chill
Mar 07 17:53:34 <Fade>	that's really the only acceptable way for a holy roller to be.
Mar 07 17:54:28 <naokotani>	I guess. I suppose sometimes people get worked up into a fervour. Everyone likes fervours for good things, so I guess we need to take the good with the bad
Mar 07 17:55:18 <naokotani>	like, would we have rust if poeple didn't get worked into a holy fervour in the name of memeory safety?
Mar 07 17:55:59 <Fade>	i'm sort of the opinion that rust was an inevitable and unimaginative recapitulation of places we had already been.
Mar 07 17:56:01 <Marvin2>	i'm sort of turning into one of them?
Mar 07 17:56:20 <Fade>	but overall it seems to have been beneficial
Mar 07 17:56:24 <naokotani>	sounds like a religion so that checks out
Mar 07 17:57:08 <Fade>	'in the absence of a sufficiently smart compiler, push all of the complexity on the human.'
Mar 07 17:57:43 <trev>	rust make human dum
Mar 07 17:57:47 <trev>	me dum now
Mar 07 17:58:17 <trev>	no can malloc no mo'
Mar 07 17:58:26 <Fade>	if I was writing an operating system, I'd probably write the bootloader in rust, and the rest of the system in lisp.
Mar 07 17:58:26 <naokotani>	Well, Joe Biden said use it so we don't have much choice
Mar 07 17:58:47 <daviwil>	Didn't Bob Marley write a song called No Malloc No Cry? 
Mar 07 17:59:04 <trev>	jah bless!
Mar 07 17:59:50 <naokotani>	ok. I really need to accomplish something to do. I am actually just going ot turn off IRC
Mar 07 17:59:52 <Marvin2>	ok. I think intellij is probably simpler on the model
Mar 07 17:59:55 <naokotani>	I will ttyl
Mar 07 18:00:01 <trev>	naokotani: wait don't leave!!!
Mar 07 18:00:07 <Fade>	I'd like to see computers re-evolve intelligent memory management hardware that was exposed to the running OS.
Mar 07 18:00:10 <naokotani>	trev: why!
Mar 07 18:00:18 <trev>	nah you can go...cya
Mar 07 18:00:22 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 07 18:00:25 <naokotani>	cya
Mar 07 18:00:26 <Fade>	l8r sk8r

Mar 07 18:02:34 <daviwil>	Indeed 
Mar 07 18:05:21 <trev>	i really do dream of only using the computer in a tty. free me from the shackles of modern computing 
Mar 07 18:06:00 <Fade>	seems like a trivial task to buy a serial terminal on ebay and connect it to some unix machine of your choice.
Mar 07 18:06:21 <trev>	the new fosskers blog post is speaking to me. i love when a blog tells me what i'm already thinking
Mar 07 18:06:27 <Fade>	this arrangement is surprisingly salubrious when you have emacs.
Mar 07 18:06:30 <trev>	Fade: can i connect it to one at your house?
Mar 07 18:06:50 <Fade>	my unix machinery is all running at capacity, so no.
Mar 07 18:07:01 <Fade>	you don't have a unix machine?
Mar 07 18:07:43 <trev>	i have a unix-like linux machine
Mar 07 18:08:10 <Fade>	I have a bunch of Sun and SGI gear, but it's only fired up for special occassions.
Mar 07 18:08:35 <Fade>	you could run Free or Open or Net BSD on a raspberry pi.
Mar 07 18:09:25 <trev>	i am connected from my bootleg pi right now
Mar 07 18:09:28 <Fade>	although I don't see why connecting the serial terminal to the linux machine wouldn't get you to pretty much the same place.
Mar 07 18:09:55 <trev>	yeah, i could skip the serial stuff and just never startx
Mar 07 18:10:02 <Fade>	Actual Unix (c)[tm] is actually sort of a pain in the ass.
Mar 07 18:10:26 <trev>	i would also need $40,000 to buy a license
Mar 07 18:10:28 <Marvin2>	i would love a keyboard that I can find causing it
Mar 07 18:10:56 <Fade>	all the causal keyboard issues remain with me, bot
Mar 07 18:10:57 <Marvin2>	all the serde stuff
Mar 07 18:11:03 <Fade>	yeah, well.
Mar 07 18:11:29 <trev>	how do you get him to trigger twice?
Mar 07 18:11:46 <Fade>	he's a totally stochastic event loop.
Mar 07 18:11:54 <Fade>	I hit two triggers in a row.
Mar 07 18:13:00 <Marvin2>	Although, you know, you could also tell the truth, Fade...
Mar 07 18:13:13 <Fade>	evil evil child.

Mar 07 18:45:38 <Fade>	I've obviously been out of my mind all these years toiling with s-expressions.
Mar 07 18:45:47 <daviwil>	When I was in college they had us write a Tomcat project as if it was cutting edge technology 
Mar 07 18:45:54 <daviwil>	Though I suppose it might have been in 2002
Mar 07 18:46:11 <Fade>	java was still ascendant back then
Mar 07 18:48:15 <Fade>	somebody at Sun thought it was Moarbeddur than PHP
Mar 07 18:48:20 <Fade>	they may have even been right.
Mar 07 18:48:31 <Fade>	which is damnation by faint praise.:)
Mar 07 18:50:01 <daviwil>	Definitely better than PHP but less hacker friendly 
Mar 07 19:07:27 <morganw>	> less hacker friendly
Mar 07 19:07:27 <morganw>	In every sense
Mar 07 20:37:56 <acdw>	what's up nerds
Mar 07 20:38:36 <acdw>	daviwil are you going to do a stream tomorrow on why scheme has four `let` variants?

Mar 07 20:45:13 <BigEatie>	Are we just triggering at howdy? Does it have to be the first word?
Mar 07 20:45:13 <trev>	BigEatie: howdy
Mar 07 20:45:15 <Marvin2>	Are we just triggering at howdy? Does it woerks :3c ?!

Mar 07 20:45:58 <BigEatie>	code dive into publish.el
Mar 07 20:46:39 <acdw>	owo
Mar 07 20:46:53 <acdw>	still not brave enough to discuss let, let*, letrec, letrec* i see
Mar 07 20:47:03 <acdw>	people want to know!!
Mar 07 20:47:51 <BigEatie>	Anyone know why I might not be able to open file dialogues (i.e. for uploading attachments) from the browser? This is true on Brave and Chromium, and is true in EXWM and i3, but not an issue in KDE. Not sure what I did to screw that up nor am I sure how to fix it.
Mar 07 20:47:54 <Marvin2>	Anyone know what pitfalls to avoid, have a couple of other peoples code
Mar 07 20:51:41 <daviwil>	acdw: I will tell you all that I know about it, but it's time to sleep! 
Mar 07 20:51:54 <daviwil>	Tomorrow's stream is diving into the code of the project.el package 
Mar 07 20:52:12 <acdw>	no sleep! only explain!

Mar 07 22:09:30 <mretka>	I miss having a band
Mar 07 22:09:31 <SummerEmacs>	can't really play  real guitar to stuff today so it mostly has to be classic rock or indie 2000s or something

Mar 07 22:10:01 <SummerEmacs>	real guitar stuff has to be rock

Mar 09 12:23:35 <naokotani>	is simple*
Mar 09 12:24:29 <naokotani>	glenneth: not sure i'd try marvin's idea of using tramp syntax
Mar 09 12:49:24 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 09 12:56:47 <glenneth>	trying it and i get cond: Symbol’s value as variable is void: nao/alpha-background

Mar 09 14:39:33 <SummerEmacs>	i use abbrevs so much it's insane

Mar 09 14:52:38 <Marvin2>	you can RSS your YouTube feed, if that's what I like this
Mar 09 14:53:07 *	SummerEmacs pats Marvin2
Mar 09 15:07:54 <sahil_>	Hi, at this point in my "dev" :) journey, I find that I gain more out of articles, than videos. Like take primeagen for example, I tend to watch his videos in my free time, as a passive activity, which turns into a sort of "entertainment", which is what I would like to avoid. So how can I remain up to date with the happenings in the tech world, without "youtube" or video watching.
Mar 09 15:07:58 <Marvin2>	Hi, at this debug adapter thing dape which is funny because I need to update my hugo build with it a path denoting a directory and open files in one project linking to org files haha
Mar 09 15:09:30 <sahil_>	The more I get entertained, the more I find myself low on energy.
Mar 09 15:14:32 <SummerEmacs>	sahil_: i use rss as well for youtube feeds so i can open them in a browser when i get to them.
Mar 09 15:20:52 <sahil_>	SummerEmacs: but at the end, those are videos, with a lot of laughter and non-serious content, which makes one think that it's entertainment (subconsciously). I was looking for medium.com's rss, but it seems they don't have a global rss feed, but rather per channel/user etc.
Mar 09 15:20:57 <Marvin2>	SummerEmacs: but at least 🙃
Mar 09 15:28:50 <SummerEmacs>	sahil_: i use hacker news a lot in rss too
Mar 09 15:28:54 <SummerEmacs>	and planetemacs
Mar 09 15:29:04 <SummerEmacs>	sahil_: i can give you some links if you want?
Mar 09 15:29:09 <SummerEmacs>	but mostly hacker news yea
Mar 09 15:29:14 <SummerEmacs>	and also some tech links
Mar 09 15:29:20 <SummerEmacs>	lemme give you some links hang on
Mar 09 15:29:27 <SummerEmacs>	sorry i was just replaying the third movement cuz it's so good
Mar 09 15:29:30 <Marvin2>	sorry i was rewatching your crafting website videos last week, and you will have to undo 80 million times and then once I adjusted a few yeras and I Feel like c++ is used a lot of interconnections
Mar 09 15:29:56 <sahil_>	SummerEmacs: I thought on this. I will go on youtube once every 2-3 months, and find what has changed. That would be the best.
Mar 09 15:30:54 <sahil_>	And in the meantime, will remain connected in the communities, where people would refer some content explicitly if neccessary.
Mar 09 15:31:17 <SummerEmacs>	oh ok
Mar 09 15:31:23 <SummerEmacs>	you only watch youtube every 2-3 months?
Mar 09 15:32:13 <SummerEmacs>	that's a bit extraordinary.
Mar 09 15:42:09 <sahil_>	SummerEmacs: that's the plan. 
Mar 09 15:43:25 <SummerEmacs>	sahil_: that's like taking a vow of chastity, poverty, and silence. 😀 
Mar 09 15:43:35 <sahil_>	Like I am a college student, and have some pockets of time here and there (while going for classes) etc.. I find that watching youtube in that time is more distracting than helpful.
Mar 09 15:43:37 <Marvin2>	Like I do
Mar 09 15:44:18 <sahil_>	It just makes the brain feel light (hollow) for some reason.
Mar 09 15:46:01 <SummerEmacs>	i understand
Mar 09 15:49:12 *	SummerEmacs pokes Fade
Mar 09 15:50:11 <SummerEmacs>	sahil_: what are you studying?
Mar 09 15:50:35 <sahil_>	Undergrad Computerscience.
Mar 09 15:50:58 <SummerEmacs>	ooh ok
Mar 09 15:51:01 <sahil_>	But more importantly, I want to implement stuff in libreoffice, like Lua uno language binding etc
Mar 09 15:51:03 <Marvin2>	But more importantly, I want my local city. jr developer for mongo/node/react stuff
Mar 09 15:51:34 <sahil_>	and that's where I don't want to fail, because I couldn't control myself from watching youtube.
Mar 09 15:51:48 <SummerEmacs>	tbf i don't usually watch computer streams cuz they are a lot of filler chatter
Mar 09 15:51:54 <SummerEmacs>	i do sometimes but it's rare
Mar 09 15:52:02 <SummerEmacs>	i usually just scan through hacker news on rss to see what's up
Mar 09 15:52:48 <SummerEmacs>	also: most streams for that are on twitch not really youtube as much
Mar 09 15:53:45 <sahil_>	but some devs like ThePrimeagen do put the content on youtube. 
Mar 09 15:54:06 <SummerEmacs>	like right now i'm reading about computer emacs stuff and i'm listening to beethoven's 7th really loudly 😀 
Mar 09 15:54:10 <SummerEmacs>	first movement
Mar 09 15:54:34 <SummerEmacs>	yea some devs do youtube but most i've noticed going live are on twitch
Mar 09 15:54:37 <sahil_>	It's less about the streams, and more about the nature of platform, where you are targeted to be used from the moment you enter. And I am not a strong willed person myself.
Mar 09 15:55:35 <SummerEmacs>	well tbf like i said i don't tend to watch devs coding live on stream cuz 1) it's not what i do for a living and 2) it tends to be just making jokes with commenters or other guests etc...
Mar 09 15:55:36 <talos>	Yo all

Mar 09 16:18:12 <Fade>	how many people will attend your party? :)
Mar 09 16:18:41 <SummerEmacs>	about 75 or so i think?
Mar 09 16:18:44 <SummerEmacs>	maybe a bit less.
Mar 09 16:18:46 <Fade>	wow
Mar 09 16:18:50 <Fade>	that's a big party.
Mar 09 16:18:52 <SummerEmacs>	eh
Mar 09 16:19:04 <SummerEmacs>	we've had a couple of bigger ones but yea it's a good size
Mar 09 16:19:10 <Fade>	are you catering?
Mar 09 16:19:15 <morganw>	Are there enough chairs?
Mar 09 16:19:16 <SummerEmacs>	sandrine and yvette are
Mar 09 16:19:35 <SummerEmacs>	we have several rooms open with our couches and chairs available
Mar 09 16:19:53 *	Fade nods
Mar 09 16:20:09 <SummerEmacs>	we have a pro DJ friend coming too
Mar 09 16:20:11 <SummerEmacs>	in a few hours
Mar 09 16:20:16 <SummerEmacs>	he'll set up an hour before we start
Mar 09 16:20:50 <Fade>	:)
Mar 09 16:21:02 <Fade>	I haven't been to a party in ages.
Mar 09 16:21:10 <SummerEmacs>	😀 
Mar 09 16:21:37 <SummerEmacs>	it'll be fun
Mar 09 16:22:12 <SummerEmacs>	sandrine and yvette have been cooking and baking all day
Mar 09 16:22:22 <SummerEmacs>	i haven't been allowed in the kitchen since after breakfast
Mar 09 16:22:38 <Fade>	one of the reasons I like to cater my parties is that it frees us up to actually enjoy the event.
Mar 09 16:23:10 <Fade>	I also get banished from the kitchen when serious cooking happens.
Mar 09 16:23:12 <SummerEmacs>	yea well if it was a professional party thing we'd get catering for the ice scultpures and such but since it's friends only, they wouldn't have it any other way.
Mar 09 16:23:26 <SummerEmacs>	close friends only
Mar 09 16:23:28 <SummerEmacs>	so it's okay
Mar 09 16:23:31 *	Fade nods
Mar 09 16:23:52 <SummerEmacs>	but honestly you can't really tell the difference between their presentation when they go all out and a professional service.
Mar 09 16:25:40 <Fade>	:D
Mar 09 16:26:51 <Fade>	I wish I had an org file parser in CL.
Mar 09 16:27:06 <SummerEmacs>	i dont' want to ask what that is
Mar 09 16:27:08 <Marvin2>	i dont' want to go on a whiteboard before I even reach production, once hte schema is basically "this"
Mar 09 16:27:32 <Fade>	a piece of code that turns an org-mode file into lisp data
Mar 09 16:27:59 <Fade>	I want to turn the bot's global index into something useful.
Mar 09 16:28:29 <Fade>	at the moment, if you hit the root page of the bot's url indexer, it will list all of the urls it has see in chronological order.
Mar 09 16:28:46 <Fade>	which has utility, but it stores quite a bit of metadata around storing urls
Mar 09 16:29:27 <SummerEmacs>	ok time to get serious: bernstein in berlin, 1989, ode to freedom, beethoven's 9th.
Mar 09 16:29:37 <SummerEmacs>	the iconic, classic, performance
Mar 09 16:29:57 <SummerEmacs>	it's even on youtube if you want hang on

Mar 09 16:32:48 <Fade>	the piece. I've never heard this performance.
Mar 09 16:32:57 <SummerEmacs>	it's essential
Mar 09 16:33:04 <Fade>	Bach is my guy.
Mar 09 16:33:06 <SummerEmacs>	he performed it during the reunification
Mar 09 16:33:14 <SummerEmacs>	bach is amazing hey i love bach i listen to it all the time
Mar 09 16:33:26 <SummerEmacs>	just saying that historically, this is an iconic performance
Mar 09 16:33:28 <Marvin2>	just saying the same time. this allows to code java or an IDE?
Mar 09 16:33:33 <Fade>	I like Beethoven second to only Bach, really.
Mar 09 16:33:36 <SummerEmacs>	something like 100 million viewers at the time or something
Mar 09 16:34:12 <Fade>	I found an interview Rick Beato did with Peter Frampton 
Mar 09 16:34:15 <Fade>	have you seen it?
Mar 09 16:34:26 <SummerEmacs>	it depends on my mood but bach is incredible but learning to play his music is very very hard just fyi
Mar 09 16:34:34 <SummerEmacs>	but i do know how to play some of it yea
Mar 09 16:34:40 <SummerEmacs>	yup i saw the interview
Mar 09 16:34:48 <SummerEmacs>	i sub to rick beato i told you a few months ago i think
Mar 09 16:34:49 <Fade>	I started out with classical guitar. the battle for bach is well understood at my house.
Mar 09 16:34:50 <SummerEmacs>	i love that guy
Mar 09 16:35:02 <Fade>	Rick Beato is my favourite music teacher.
Mar 09 16:35:10 <Fade>	the Beato Book is excellent.
Mar 09 16:35:26 <SummerEmacs>	i heard to learn partita no. 2 on the violin when i was young so i know every single note
Mar 09 16:35:31 <SummerEmacs>	and i have several recordings of it ofc
Mar 09 16:35:49 <SummerEmacs>	and his passacaglia and fugue is def on my top 3 faves of all time
Mar 09 16:37:11 <Fade>	<3
Mar 09 16:37:23 <SummerEmacs>	oh i know my bach haha
Mar 09 16:37:51 <SummerEmacs>	also: goldberg variations. i mean...gould in both recordings.
Mar 09 16:37:59 <Fade>	auld glen
Mar 09 16:38:01 <SummerEmacs>	some people don't like his humming but i LOVE it
Mar 09 16:38:03 <Fade>	the boy could play.
Mar 09 16:38:12 <SummerEmacs>	yea and he was a canuck like you!
Mar 09 16:38:21 <SummerEmacs>	a canadan from canadia
Mar 09 16:38:26 <Fade>	I went to prep school about three blocks from where glen gould used to live.
Mar 09 16:39:22 <SummerEmacs>	well you're lucky to have been so close to sacred ground 😀 
Mar 09 16:39:34 <Fade>	there's nothing sacred in this dirty old town.
Mar 09 16:39:35 <Fade>	lol
Mar 09 16:39:39 <SummerEmacs>	lol
Mar 09 16:39:52 <SummerEmacs>	he wasn't either. he was a very odd person BUT he could play incredibly well
Mar 09 16:40:13 <Fade>	yep
Mar 09 16:40:22 <Fade>	an interesting example of somebody crippled by genius.

Mar 09 16:42:37 <SummerEmacs>	apparently tons did
Mar 09 16:42:39 <SummerEmacs>	it was huge
Mar 09 16:42:43 <Fade>	for sure
Mar 09 16:42:49 <SummerEmacs>	it was like the official reunification ceremony or something
Mar 09 16:43:55 <SummerEmacs>	35 years ago
Mar 09 16:44:23 <Fade>	yep
Mar 09 16:45:19 <SummerEmacs>	3 different philharmonics playing together
Mar 09 16:45:25 <SummerEmacs>	bavarian, london, and new york
Mar 09 16:45:38 <Fade>	there was a russian orchestra also
Mar 09 16:45:42 <SummerEmacs>	that's right
Mar 09 16:47:23 <Fade>	this is an outstanding performance. I haven't heard it in years
Mar 09 16:47:29 <SummerEmacs>	yea it's one of my favorites
Mar 09 16:47:39 <SummerEmacs>	it's quintissential!
Mar 09 16:47:53 <Fade>	I like how Bernstein is working from memory
Mar 09 16:47:57 <SummerEmacs>	yup
Mar 09 16:48:00 <Fade>	he doesn't even need the sheet music
Mar 09 16:48:09 <SummerEmacs>	my mom has the DVD i grew up on it
Mar 09 16:48:16 <SummerEmacs>	i'm listening from itunes atm 
Mar 09 16:48:31 <SummerEmacs>	she bought it in like 1990 when it came out or something
Mar 09 16:48:38 *	Fade nods
Mar 09 16:48:49 <Fade>	that would have been the VHS years. :)
Mar 09 16:49:01 <Fade>	I used to collect concert tapes
Mar 09 16:49:07 <SummerEmacs>	i guess she bought it later
Mar 09 16:49:12 <SummerEmacs>	but it was out on dvd
Mar 09 16:49:26 <SummerEmacs>	i dunno when you go back so far i mix up tech from the past at that point 🤣 
Mar 09 16:49:37 <Fade>	i'm certain it would have been transported to each new media as it appeared.
Mar 09 16:49:41 <SummerEmacs>	yea
Mar 09 16:49:45 <SummerEmacs>	well i grew up with it on dvd
Mar 09 16:49:50 <SummerEmacs>	and cd ofc
Mar 09 16:49:52 <Fade>	*nod*
Mar 09 16:51:22 <SummerEmacs>	gould also played without sheet music
Mar 09 16:51:24 <SummerEmacs>	that's the only way to play
Mar 09 16:51:28 <Marvin2>	that's the thing about graveyard shift is having no idea Rust Rover rather
Mar 09 16:51:29 <SummerEmacs>	i never use sheet music
Mar 09 16:51:39 <SummerEmacs>	i can read it, i can learn with it, but i don't play with it after
Mar 09 16:53:14 <Fade>	Leonard Bernstein died in october 1990.
Mar 09 16:53:53 <SummerEmacs>	every time i hear the 3rd movement i think of col. klink in hoagan's heroes, cuz his father was otto klemperer and he conducted this brilliantly in the 60s and his son is playing cello in the orchestra i think.
Mar 09 16:54:01 <SummerEmacs>	yup i know he was really sick when they recorded this
Mar 09 16:55:16 <SummerEmacs>	my mom pointed out that klemperer family history to me and that's how i was introduced to hoagan's heroes actually 🤣 
Mar 09 16:55:19 <Fade>	Werner Klemperer
Mar 09 16:55:26 <SummerEmacs>	she is very impressed by it all
Mar 09 16:56:03 <Fade>	:)
Mar 09 16:56:53 <SummerEmacs>	i also read that he had a clause in his contract or something that if the germans ever got the upper hand in an episode, he would resign his acting part immediately
Mar 09 16:57:42 <SummerEmacs>	but yea i have a few klemperer recordings (from his dad) and they are really amazing.
Mar 09 16:58:16 <Fade>	abbey road was created to capture orchestral recordings
Mar 09 16:58:19 <SummerEmacs>	the third movement 💖 
Mar 09 16:58:32 <SummerEmacs>	i didn't know that
Mar 09 16:58:37 <Fade>	I'm still in the first
Mar 09 16:58:42 <SummerEmacs>	i'm on the third hehe
Mar 09 16:58:47 <SummerEmacs>	just started
Mar 09 16:59:25 <Fade>	when I think of the performances I've seen at pretty small concert halls in Europe, it's sort of heart breaking that so little of the performances past were captured with any fidelity.
Mar 09 16:59:43 <SummerEmacs>	well in the past. not anymore
Mar 09 16:59:49 <Fade>	we didn't even know how to record large halls until the seventies, and the technology didn't become good until basically now.
Mar 09 16:59:51 <SummerEmacs>	i mean arte shows incredible ones now since decades i think
Mar 09 17:00:17 <SummerEmacs>	i imagine the sound engineering is really high tech for that stuff
Mar 09 17:00:21 <SummerEmacs>	i dunno anything about it tbh
Mar 09 17:00:40 <Fade>	the largest symphony hall in Toronto is an active structure.
Mar 09 17:00:44 <SummerEmacs>	third is one of my favorite movements
Mar 09 17:00:54 <SummerEmacs>	it moves or something?
Mar 09 17:01:02 <SummerEmacs>	to change the sound reverberations?
Mar 09 17:01:07 <Fade>	it reacts to the music being played to minimise harmonic distortions
Mar 09 17:01:15 <SummerEmacs>	wow that's pretty amazing
Mar 09 17:01:24 <Fade>	yeah, it has moving panels and active speakers
Mar 09 17:01:37 <SummerEmacs>	that is pretty amazing
Mar 09 17:02:04 <Fade>	they had to do it, because the architecture of the hall was all form over function and for the first twenty years the concerts sounded *terrible*
Mar 09 17:02:08 <Fade>	now it's world class.
Mar 09 17:02:18 <SummerEmacs>	the third movement is so perfectly beethoven
Mar 09 17:02:32 <SummerEmacs>	wow i'd love to see it sometime
Mar 09 17:02:41 <Fade>	Roy Thompson Hall
Mar 09 17:02:58 <Fade>	you can see pictures online. You've probably seen it in many films and television shows.
Mar 09 17:03:08 <SummerEmacs>	oh i think i have yea
Mar 09 17:03:14 <Fade>	it's a very 'futuristic' looking building
Mar 09 17:03:39 <SummerEmacs>	yea i've seen it on arte a few times ithink
Mar 09 17:03:57 <SummerEmacs>	that's such an awesome channel btw
Mar 09 17:04:09 <Fade>	I don't know the channel. is it from France?
Mar 09 17:04:31 <SummerEmacs>	https://www.arte.tv/
Mar 09 17:04:34 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/iqoJR ]::[ ARTE, the European culture TV channel, free and on demand ]
Mar 09 17:04:41 <SummerEmacs>	it's german originally i think but a coopration perhaps between german and french
Mar 09 17:04:50 <Fade>	nice
Mar 09 17:04:52 <SummerEmacs>	it's a little european gem
Mar 09 17:04:52 <Marvin2>	nice thing about graveyard shift is having no idea Rust Rover was a naming scheme in .NET back in the early noughts to write a c lib.
Mar 09 17:05:19 <SummerEmacs>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arte
Mar 09 17:05:21 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/dDxKq ]::[ Arte - Wikipedia ]
Mar 09 17:05:41 <SummerEmacs>	basically it's like really their PBS
Mar 09 17:05:51 <SummerEmacs>	but much more centered towards the performing arts in general
Mar 09 17:06:20 <Fade>	awesome
Mar 09 17:06:57 <SummerEmacs>	yea
Mar 09 17:07:01 <SummerEmacs>	i absolutely love it
Mar 09 17:07:23 <glenneth>	I just got an email from my boss, asking what this "o/" was  :D
Mar 09 17:07:30 <Fade>	lol
Mar 09 17:07:34 <Fade>	o7
Mar 09 17:07:45 <SummerEmacs>	glenneth: what did you tell him it was?
Mar 09 17:07:55 <SummerEmacs>	""
Mar 09 17:08:08 <SummerEmacs>	"It's an emoji from before emoji existed"
Mar 09 17:08:17 <glenneth>	I didn't realise I had put it in the email I sent him earlier. lol
Mar 09 17:08:47 <glenneth>	my irc life is bleeding over :D
Mar 09 17:08:50 <Fade>	and irc culture bleeds through!
Mar 09 17:08:50 <SummerEmacs>	lol
Mar 09 17:08:55 <Fade>	natch
Mar 09 17:08:56 <SummerEmacs>	haha jinx
Mar 09 17:09:17 <glenneth>	that's exactly what i told him SummerEmacs lol
Mar 09 17:09:17 <Fade>	"OLA JEFFE!"
Mar 09 17:09:27 <Fade>	o/
Mar 09 17:09:29 *	Fade laughs
Mar 09 17:09:33 <SummerEmacs>	sec i'm
Mar 09 17:09:35 <SummerEmacs>	wow
Mar 09 17:09:44 <glenneth>	lol  pretty much yeah.
Mar 09 17:09:46 <SummerEmacs>	just the crescendo in this is so good
Mar 09 17:09:50 <Marvin2>	just the url. I was worried you had programmed it to open a modal with their lifestyles
Mar 09 17:10:12 <glenneth>	Marvin2: please do 
Mar 09 17:10:17 <Fade>	I guess this is the best merged orchestra that has ever been assembled.
Mar 09 17:10:20 <Marvin2>	I guess you were lamenting that the topic where I know who has a fancy laser machine that doesn't map into another ice storm.
Mar 09 17:10:26 <SummerEmacs>	Fade: it's amazing
Mar 09 17:10:30 <SummerEmacs>	but this third movmeent yea
Mar 09 17:11:07 <SummerEmacs>	starting about halfway it really gets serious with the legato
Mar 09 17:11:10 <Marvin2>	starting about halfway it really spooked my wife. Hugo seems like a playoff game.
Mar 09 17:11:13 <SummerEmacs>	and it's like a river
Mar 09 17:11:16 <Marvin2>	and it's so upbeat
Mar 09 17:11:53 <Fade>	it would have been the first time the leningrad and new york philharmonics were ever in the same room together.
Mar 09 17:12:01 <SummerEmacs>	oh yea
Mar 09 17:12:02 <SummerEmacs>	def
Mar 09 17:12:26 <Fade>	I'm kind of surprised it was the bavarian radio orchestra 
Mar 09 17:12:35 <Fade>	but I imagine there were some politics involved.
Mar 09 17:12:38 <SummerEmacs>	my dad used to tell me i didn't know what it was like during the cold war. then the last 2 years happened and i'm like 'was it like this, dad?' 
Mar 09 17:13:01 <Fade>	the past six years have been worse than the cold war
Mar 09 17:13:13 <SummerEmacs>	i've heard
Mar 09 17:13:18 <Fade>	because for four of them the whitehouse has been controlled by a literal fascist.
Mar 09 17:13:20 <SummerEmacs>	i mean first hand i've heard i've seen
Mar 09 17:13:37 <SummerEmacs>	yea don't get me started i won't even be able to stop
Mar 09 17:13:39 <Marvin2>	yea don't get that with this terrible pain in all the new keymap functionality in emacs for all data structures, even ones not yet but we fly first class
Mar 09 17:13:46 <Fade>	during the cold war, the leaders were at least serious people with strong minds.
Mar 09 17:13:51 <SummerEmacs>	yea
Mar 09 17:14:07 <Fade>	for the most part. I guess there's an argument to be made that reagan was a muddle head by the end of his stand.
Mar 09 17:14:48 <SummerEmacs>	i think his strength was probably his character and people skills which let him approach  gorbachev in a different way
Mar 09 17:15:09 <SummerEmacs>	but also he was wrong about many things but he wasn't a total idiot
Mar 09 17:15:18 *	Fade nods
Mar 09 17:15:26 <SummerEmacs>	i mean i'm going on history here so like i dunno first hand tho
Mar 09 17:15:31 <Fade>	i think his alzheimer's disease was really setting in by the end.
Mar 09 17:16:17 <SummerEmacs>	it's wrapping up the 3rd btw
Mar 09 17:16:19 <SummerEmacs>	so gorgeous
Mar 09 17:16:24 <Fade>	okay, I don't want to think about world politics. I'm listening to beethoven.
Mar 09 17:16:32 <Fade>	lets not turn this into the ludovico treatment.
Mar 09 17:16:39 <SummerEmacs>	gorgeousness and gorgeosity, as little alex would say
Mar 09 17:16:58 *	Fade gets to the third movement
Mar 09 17:17:01 <SummerEmacs>	see i'm well read
Mar 09 17:17:02 <SummerEmacs>	hehe
Mar 09 17:17:09 <SummerEmacs>	also i saw the movie but i did read the book
Mar 09 17:17:15 <Fade>	a bit of the old ludwig van!
Mar 09 17:17:24 <SummerEmacs>	which is almost exactly the same except in the book you have an ending where he grows up
Mar 09 17:17:36 <SummerEmacs>	and gets older and has kids
Mar 09 17:17:47 *	Fade nods
Mar 09 17:18:08 <Fade>	I remember watching this and being very worried that Bernstein was giong to collapse.
Mar 09 17:18:09 <SummerEmacs>	fourth starts now
Mar 09 17:18:19 <Fade>	i'm one movement behind you.
Mar 09 17:18:20 <SummerEmacs>	so grand
Mar 09 17:18:51 <SummerEmacs>	gawd i love spacial audio
Mar 09 17:18:54 <SummerEmacs>	sooo amazing
Mar 09 17:18:56 <SummerEmacs>	it sounds like you're there
Mar 09 17:19:26 <Fade>	alas, I'm hearing through only half decent speakers, but the source is youtube, so that's a blessing.
Mar 09 17:19:33 <SummerEmacs>	haha
Mar 09 17:19:42 <SummerEmacs>	trust me it's amazing
Mar 09 17:19:54 <Fade>	I've heard this show many times, and for good reason
Mar 09 17:19:59 <Fade>	just not in a long long time.
Mar 09 17:20:07 <Fade>	so, you are correct!
Mar 09 17:20:12 <SummerEmacs>	when you turn your head it sounds like the stage is still in front of you and the music is bouncing around you as if you're in a live concert hall 
Mar 09 17:20:24 <Fade>	oh, you mean spatial audio.
Mar 09 17:20:27 <Fade>	I have that in my car.
Mar 09 17:20:27 <SummerEmacs>	i have my airpod pro maxes on
Mar 09 17:20:32 <SummerEmacs>	yea spatial audio sorry
Mar 09 17:24:09 <Fade>	ooh... arte.tv has streams
Mar 09 17:24:12 <Fade>	nice!
Mar 09 17:24:46 <SummerEmacs>	yea it does!
Mar 09 17:24:50 <SummerEmacs>	you can watch it online
Mar 09 17:24:52 <SummerEmacs>	i think
Mar 09 17:24:59 <benoitj>	hey Fade SummerEmacs 
Mar 09 17:25:02 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi
Mar 09 17:25:31 <Fade>	heya benoit
Mar 09 17:26:04 <SummerEmacs>	it's an odd and different day cuz i'm at home on a saturday afternoon 🤣 
Mar 09 17:26:16 <SummerEmacs>	i'm not usually
Mar 09 17:27:10 <SummerEmacs>	and the voices start
Mar 09 17:27:14 <SummerEmacs>	there we go
Mar 09 17:27:41 <naokotani>	I got both displays working. I think that's the last major pieces of the arch puzzle
Mar 09 17:27:49 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi
Mar 09 17:27:56 <naokotani>	although I think the resolution is a bit off
Mar 09 17:28:03 <naokotani>	SummerEmacs: hi
Mar 09 17:28:20 <SummerEmacs>	fade and i are sharing in beethoven's 9th
Mar 09 17:28:32 <SummerEmacs>	he's a movement behind tho
Mar 09 17:28:37 <naokotani>	oh sick. I love 9th
Mar 09 17:28:44 <naokotani>	especially the clockwork organge version
Mar 09 17:28:46 <Fade>	you're right about the third. it's really peak beethoven.
Mar 09 17:29:04 <SummerEmacs>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn0IS-vlwCI
Mar 09 17:29:06 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/tUGPP ]::[ The Berlin Celebration Concert 1989 - Leonard Bernstein - Beethoven Symphony No 9 - YouTube ]
Mar 09 17:29:10 <naokotani>	I think his later stuff is
Mar 09 17:29:14 <SummerEmacs>	Fade: yup it really really is 😀 
Mar 09 17:29:31 <naokotani>	because it's more innovative
Mar 09 17:29:37 <naokotani>	it doens't seem innovative now, but it was then
Mar 09 17:30:15 <naokotani>	the third is the eroica or whatever?
Mar 09 17:30:28 <SummerEmacs>	yes
Mar 09 17:30:30 <SummerEmacs>	eroica
Mar 09 17:30:40 <SummerEmacs>	oh my fave part is on hang on
Mar 09 17:30:46 <SummerEmacs>	after the first chorus
Mar 09 17:30:46 <naokotani>	its deifnitely so sick too
Mar 09 17:30:51 <SummerEmacs>	slow...and tempo increasing
Mar 09 17:31:00 <SummerEmacs>	it's the march
Mar 09 17:31:51 <SummerEmacs>	Fade: see i know my styles for music (re: third) 😀 
Mar 09 17:32:17 <Fade>	I used to spend a _lot_ of time actively listening to music.
Mar 09 17:32:27 <naokotani>	yeah the thind is a traditional classical symphony iirc
Mar 09 17:32:28 <SummerEmacs>	i had to play some of that too so
Mar 09 17:32:28 <Fade>	since too long it has been merely wallpaper.
Mar 09 17:32:31 <Marvin2>	i had a couple of bigger ones but yea for the return value of the platonic ideal of her type.
Mar 09 17:32:33 <Marvin2>	since too long it needs to be trying a few new packages I haven't updated them in a lab
Mar 09 17:32:44 <naokotani>	they all have the same similar elements
Mar 09 17:32:47 <Marvin2>	they all work without problems
Mar 09 17:32:57 <naokotani>	no way marvin, some were a lot better than others
Mar 09 17:33:00 <Marvin2>	no way to figure what the compiler and the rest
Mar 09 17:33:19 <naokotani>	you can tell the composer sometimes just by listening or the period
Mar 09 17:33:31 <SummerEmacs>	oh i pretty much can tell yup
Mar 09 17:34:11 <SummerEmacs>	it's coming
Mar 09 17:34:17 <SummerEmacs>	aaaaandddd.....
Mar 09 17:34:20 <SummerEmacs>	now
Mar 09 17:34:40 <nm0i>	ö/
Mar 09 17:34:45 <SummerEmacs>	the violins
Mar 09 17:34:53 <Fade>	somebody coming in, in the middle of this conversation would be *very* confused. :D
Mar 09 17:34:54 <SummerEmacs>	so amazing when they sing
Mar 09 17:34:55 <Marvin2>	somebody coming in, in the correct answer
Mar 09 17:35:19 <Fade>	heya, nm0i 
Mar 09 17:35:23 <SummerEmacs>	lol
Mar 09 17:35:49 <naokotani>	my fav is 7th symphony second movement
Mar 09 17:35:58 <SummerEmacs>	just went over that an hour ago 😀 
Mar 09 17:36:01 <Marvin2>	just went over that one trust me if I have a horrible feeling it's still worth it. thanks auntie cow_2001
Mar 09 17:36:18 <Fade>	auntie cow!
Mar 09 17:36:23 <Fade>	he'll be so pleased.
Mar 09 17:36:36 <nm0i>	...Gladly I have a summary so I'm not very confused.
Mar 09 17:37:03 <naokotani>	7th symphony 2nd movement hits me right smack the int he feels every time
Mar 09 17:37:24 <SummerEmacs>	yea i was listening to baremboim from 2019 on the 7th earlier
Mar 09 17:37:38 <SummerEmacs>	today has been a beethoven day cuz last night was mozart opera
Mar 09 17:38:26 <naokotani>	unpopular opinion: Mozart's operas are the best operas
Mar 09 17:38:43 <SummerEmacs>	i kinda agree even tho i love the ring and i love all of puccini as well
Mar 09 17:38:43 <Fade>	I didn't realize that the fourth movement was adapted as the Anthem of Europe.
Mar 09 17:38:51 <SummerEmacs>	Fade: yup it was apparently
Mar 09 17:38:59 <Fade>	I'm a bad european.
Mar 09 17:39:01 <naokotani>	puccini is to popy
Mar 09 17:39:07 <SummerEmacs>	i love puccini
Mar 09 17:39:20 <naokotani>	I don't hate it, but it just feels like pop music to me a bit
Mar 09 17:39:31 <naokotani>	like, I can listen to abba too, but its not my favorite
Mar 09 17:39:33 <SummerEmacs>	naokotani:  but you know, you're forgetting the *best* opera writer of all time.
Mar 09 17:39:36 <SummerEmacs>	salieri
Mar 09 17:39:38 <SummerEmacs>	😀 
Mar 09 17:39:40 <Fade>	lol
Mar 09 17:39:53 <SummerEmacs>	he liked *my* music...
Mar 09 17:39:59 <SummerEmacs>	i liked myself.
Mar 09 17:40:02 <SummerEmacs>	🤣 
Mar 09 17:40:31 <SummerEmacs>	cmon you can't like be in paris without listening to la boheme a few times i mean it's impossible not to...
Mar 09 17:40:32 <Fade>	well, I guess Europe has the best anthem.
Mar 09 17:40:42 <SummerEmacs>	yea i like the anthem 😀 
Mar 09 17:41:08 <SummerEmacs>	but yea i love mozart's operas
Mar 09 17:41:10 <naokotani>	if i go to paris im going ot be listenting to bizet tbh
Mar 09 17:41:10 <SummerEmacs>	absolutely adore them
Mar 09 17:41:17 <SummerEmacs>	it was don giovanni last night for me
Mar 09 17:41:24 <Fade>	I like his requiem mass, but mostly I'm not a huge fan of Mozart.
Mar 09 17:41:27 <SummerEmacs>	well yea bizet without saying ofc
Mar 09 17:41:36 <SummerEmacs>	omg i love mozart
Mar 09 17:41:45 <naokotani>	Mozarts piano sonatas are brokenly OP
Mar 09 17:41:52 <Fade>	I don't *dislike* mozart, but I rarely rarely reach for him.
Mar 09 17:42:00 <naokotani>	its like shakespears sonnets, banger after banger
Mar 09 17:42:17 <SummerEmacs>	mozart piano concertos are him showing off his cadenzas in front of everyone because he was the eddie van halen on the pianoforte at the time and wanted everyone to know it.
Mar 09 17:43:32 <naokotani>	I prefer listening to his piano sonatas for passive listneing, but my favorite music of his is his operas
Mar 09 17:43:33 <SummerEmacs>	i mean amadeus was def fiction, but what wasn't fiction was the way they portrayed mozart.
Mar 09 17:43:40 <SummerEmacs>	he was a little @#$@#$ like that 🤣 
Mar 09 17:43:46 <naokotani>	especially the magic flute
Mar 09 17:43:53 <naokotani>	mostly because Ir eally like to say magic flute in german
Mar 09 17:43:54 <SummerEmacs>	yea i love the magic flute
Mar 09 17:44:03 <SummerEmacs>	die zauberflote

Mar 09 17:46:44 <naokotani>	you wanna talk about hitting the feels lol
Mar 09 17:47:01 <SummerEmacs>	it's finishing up here now
Mar 09 17:47:06 <SummerEmacs>	the 9th i mean
Mar 09 17:47:21 <Fade>	i'm just getting into the real meat.
Mar 09 17:47:58 <SummerEmacs>	almost finished here
Mar 09 17:48:03 <SummerEmacs>	and the final part
Mar 09 17:48:11 <Fade>	I should write a stream multiplexer into Marvin for active channel listening.
Mar 09 17:48:28 <Fade>	so we'd all be on the same movement. :)
Mar 09 17:48:38 <SummerEmacs>	wow
Mar 09 17:48:40 <SummerEmacs>	it's done
Mar 09 17:49:00 <SummerEmacs>	i gotta shower in a bit and get ready
Mar 09 17:49:10 <SummerEmacs>	DJ is coming in just over an hour to set up
Mar 09 17:49:20 <naokotani>	Who is DJ?
Mar 09 17:49:24 <Fade>	Have fun!
Mar 09 17:49:24 <SummerEmacs>	a friend
Mar 09 17:49:30 <SummerEmacs>	i'm not going yet but real soonish
Mar 09 17:49:38 <SummerEmacs>	he's a pro dj tho
Mar 09 17:51:34 <SummerEmacs>	btw Fade if you wanna hear really really good mozart: glenn gould playing mozart piano concerto no. 24 k491
Mar 09 17:51:35 <SummerEmacs>	trust me
Mar 09 17:52:04 <SummerEmacs>	susskind conducting the CBS orchestra
Mar 09 17:52:14 <SummerEmacs>	sorry CBC
Mar 09 17:52:15 <SummerEmacs>	lol
Mar 09 17:52:16 <SummerEmacs>	not CBS
Mar 09 17:52:20 <Fade>	I find mozart a little fussy, but I'll look it up.
Mar 09 17:52:25 <SummerEmacs>	i think CBS did have an orchestra once tho but not sure
Mar 09 17:52:29 <SummerEmacs>	trust me listen to it
Mar 09 17:52:33 <SummerEmacs>	it's perfect
Mar 09 17:52:41 <SummerEmacs>	it's also one of my favorite piano concertos ever
Mar 09 17:52:49 <SummerEmacs>	also i think it was beethoven's fave but not sure about that
Mar 09 17:53:51 <SummerEmacs>	yea probably here: Ludwig van Beethoven admired the concerto and it may have influenced his Piano Concerto No. 3, also in C minor.[31][44] After hearing the work in a rehearsal, Beethoven reportedly remarked to a colleague that "[w]e shall never be able to do anything like that."[44][48] Johannes Brahms also admired the concerto, encouraging Clara Schumann to play it, and wrote his own cadenza for the first movement.[49] Brahms 
Mar 09 17:53:51 <SummerEmacs>	referred to the work as a "masterpiece of art and full of inspired ideas."[50]

Mar 09 17:54:18 <SummerEmacs>	also beethoven piano concerto no. 3 is something i adore. 
Mar 09 17:54:24 <SummerEmacs>	absolutely adore
Mar 09 17:55:55 <SummerEmacs>	ok
Mar 09 17:56:01 <SummerEmacs>	time to start getting ready
Mar 09 17:56:04 <SummerEmacs>	i'll see you guys
Mar 09 17:56:06 <Fade>	o7
Mar 09 17:56:08 <SummerEmacs>	might drop in before but we'll see
Mar 09 17:56:09 <SummerEmacs>	👋 
Mar 09 17:56:45 <bujiraso>	is there a way to put the ERC window along the bottom... hmm.
Mar 09 17:57:02 <bujiraso>	evil mode is off in ERC, or I'd use 'C-w J'
Mar 09 18:00:42 <Fade>	well, by default: To swap the top and bottom windows when two windows are open, use a sequence of seven keys, 'C-x 0 C-x 4 b' . 
Mar 09 18:01:39 <bujiraso>	That just seems to close the #systemcrafter's buffer after C-x 0
Mar 09 18:02:07 <Fade>	I'm just reading from the documentation.
Mar 09 18:02:51 <bujiraso>	ah cool, yeah I'm scraping through docs and StackOverflow for whatever evil-window-move-very-bottom is doing
Mar 09 18:05:12 <naokotani>	ok. now I have my resolution sorted and my mouse curosr isn't showing up on my main display
Mar 09 18:05:16 <Fade>	this is what I do in my config around window managment: https://0x0.st/Hhb-.txt
Mar 09 18:05:21 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/wOsSs ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 09 18:05:33 <Fade>	okay, i'm off for a bit. ta'
Mar 09 18:23:17 <bujiraso>	ah-ah. Okay, so ... if anyone wants to know, evil-window-move-very-bottom is kind of bespoke, so you can't just do it in any plain Emacs style. On the other hand, it's just a matter of ensuring you have evil-mode on in ERC and then hitting ESC to get back into normal mode (forgot to try that). Then you have your normal bindings again to move windows as you please. I added a line in my use-package to (evil-set-initial-state 'erc
Mar 09 18:23:17 <bujiraso>	'normal). It might be redundant. [SOLVED]. Now I can use ERC happily while Hexchat is newly out-of-support
Mar 09 18:23:19 <Marvin2>	ah-ah. Okay, so ... if anyone wants to know, evil-window-move-very-bottom is doing
Mar 09 18:23:48 <bujiraso>	hm. what's this now? Marvin2 repeated a part of my message? hopefully it sent ok.
Mar 09 18:25:18 <benoitj>	bujiraso: he's a bot
Mar 09 18:25:49 <benoitj>	he has automatic triggers

Mar 09 18:29:19 *	Fade laughs
Mar 09 18:29:33 <bujiraso>	Anyone know how to open a DM in ERC? I like to avoid typing /msg NickServ every time by opening a DM in HexChat... not sure what the IRC for /dm is
Mar 09 18:29:39 <benoitj>	52k was the stat when she came back
Mar 09 18:30:33 <benoitj>	use query instead of msg
Mar 09 18:30:55 <bujiraso>	oh! thanks, that's it.
Mar 09 18:30:56 <Fade>	bujiraso: I don't use erc, but in a standard irc client, in the input box I'd type /msg bujiraso hey man! welcome to the systemcrafters IRC channel
Mar 09 18:31:18 <bujiraso>	mm, true Fade, but I want to have a loooong talk with NickServ. Do you normally prepend that to all messages? 
Mar 09 18:31:19 <benoitj>	Fade: query is the standard way to start a "discussion"
Mar 09 18:31:21 <Marvin2>	mm, true Fade, but I guess this is more subjective. does data go ina nd come out is a different version of this song 🤣
Mar 09 18:31:40 <Fade>	oh, you mean in a dedicated window? yeah
Mar 09 18:31:52 <Fade>	my client opens all dm's in a dedicated window.
Mar 09 18:33:16 <benoitj>	ok
Mar 09 18:33:31 <Fade>	you are, of course, correct about /query
Mar 09 18:34:16 <bujiraso>	confirmed my evil initial mode thingy is redundant. You just start in ERC in insert mode. :-)
Mar 09 18:34:32 <benoitj>	:)
Mar 09 18:57:41 <BiggerEatier>	Howdy
Mar 09 18:58:12 <benoitj>	hey BiggerEatier 
Mar 09 19:19:34 <naokotani>	I seem to have resolved my graphics woes with way-displays
Mar 09 19:21:16 <trev>	what was happening naokotani ?
Mar 09 19:21:39 <naokotani>	well, first and foremost I missed part of the nvidia setup
Mar 09 19:21:55 <naokotani>	but then I jus tcould get my 1440p and my internal 1080p to play nice
Mar 09 19:23:16 <naokotani>	but I think I can safely say now that my system is running well and looks, well if im being enitrely honest, sick as hell
Mar 09 19:23:17 <trev>	i like how we shamed you into installing linux
Mar 09 19:23:20 <Marvin2>	but I im pretty sure they would have been having trouble setting up Forgejo to host myself
Mar 09 19:23:46 <naokotani>	It was probably inevitable
Mar 09 19:23:48 <trev>	how did you configure waybar?
Mar 09 19:23:55 <trev>	send a screenshot

Mar 09 19:43:30 <trev>	you eat a lot of carrots probably
Mar 09 19:43:39 <naokotan1>	mostly I eat potatoes
Mar 09 19:43:49 <naokotan1>	and um
Mar 09 19:43:53 <naokotan1>	ranch dressing
Mar 09 19:43:59 <naokotan1>	maybe its the dressing?
Mar 09 19:44:15 <trev>	love ranch. i knew it had healing properties
Mar 09 19:44:41 <naokotan1>	I prefer blue cheese, but my wife hates it so I compromise
Mar 09 19:44:50 <trev>	i make my own ranch now
Mar 09 19:45:29 <naokotan1>	id make my own cheese but I feel like that owuld end in me toxoplasmosis or something
Mar 09 19:45:32 <Marvin2>	id make my it habit more sticky
Mar 09 19:45:44 <naokotan1>	own blue cheese*
Mar 09 19:46:09 <naokotan1>	next I guess I need to sort out some startup stuff
Mar 09 19:46:11 <trev>	just add smelly socks to ranch
Mar 09 19:46:25 <naokotan1>	auto connect my keyboard and start kanata

Mar 09 19:49:41 <daviwil>	I'm Greek
Mar 09 19:49:51 <naokotan1>	Apparently.
Mar 09 19:50:19 <trev>	i actually only use that too but with balsamic glaze 
Mar 09 19:50:26 <naokotan1>	Try that Olive oil stuff in texas and you risk losing a limb
Mar 09 19:50:35 <daviwil>	Balsamic is nice 
Mar 09 19:50:56 <trev>	i only like ranch on chicken wings
Mar 09 19:51:10 <naokotan1>	I mostly ut it on pizza crust and potatoe wedges
Mar 09 19:51:26 <trev>	yeah that's good too
Mar 09 19:51:43 <naokotan1>	In all seriousness
Mar 09 19:51:54 <naokotan1>	there is a very wide quality in olive oil
Mar 09 19:52:00 <trev>	i'm always serious about ranch
Mar 09 19:52:05 <naokotan1>	and we just don't really have access to anything even medium quality
Mar 09 19:52:14 <naokotan1>	I guess I could order it online if I took out a mortgage
Mar 09 19:53:06 <naokotan1>	and honestly, i will take ranch over crappy olive oil any day
Mar 09 19:55:53 <naokotan1>	There must be a way to auto connect with bluetoothctl
Mar 09 19:55:57 <naokotan1>	but im just not seeing it
Mar 09 19:59:38 <naokotan1>	daviwil: how do you do teams on linux?
Mar 09 20:00:08 <naokotan1>	I tried to web app and it seemed pretty much comperable so I was thinking of just stickign with that
Mar 09 20:04:50 <daviwil>	naokotan1: I used it via Flatpak until company policy prevented me from using Office apps on Guix 
Mar 09 20:05:38 <naokotan1>	well, They don't want you hacking the mainframe
Mar 09 20:08:06 <morganw>	I cannot get the web version to work.  In Chrome I have no microphone input, and in Firefox the microphone works but the screensharing is broken.  I can however join the meeting from Firefox and Chrome at the same time.
Mar 09 20:08:09 <Marvin2>	I cannot subscribe to any jobs?
Mar 09 20:09:07 <morganw>	I believe they killed the Linux desktop app in favour of the web version, so there are no alternatives.
Mar 09 20:09:14 <naokotan1>	intresting. I just installed archa nd firefox and it seemd to work
Mar 09 20:09:52 <naokotan1>	SEEMED to work mind you. I didn't go thorugh the experience of a meeting I just opned it and tried to see if comms seemd functional
Mar 09 20:10:42 <morganw>	In Firefox I get "Teams Classic", which prompts me to click a button that doesn't work about why Firefox might not work.  In Chrome everything looks fine (no warnings and the "new" Teams), but I've not been able to get the microphone to work.
Mar 09 20:10:45 <Marvin2>	In Firefox I get to do nothing
Mar 09 20:13:39 <naokotan1>	morganw: to be clear, that is basically how teams runs on windows
Mar 09 20:13:41 <Marvin2>	morganw: to be where I can uninstall one of the tech markets
Mar 09 20:14:09 <naokotan1>	sounds like native app performance to me
Mar 09 20:15:53 <shom>	hi o/
Mar 09 20:17:39 <shom>	@naokotan1, I've been messing with kanata and I have it running without root as a systemd service
Mar 09 20:17:42 <Marvin2>	@naokotan1, I've been doing these days its going much better
Mar 09 20:17:56 <shom>	Marvin2, that's actually true
Mar 09 20:18:20 <naokotan1>	shom: I saw something about that in a thread, but I didn't dig into it
Mar 09 20:18:42 <naokotan1>	if I do that I can can just exec-once in my hyprconfig
Mar 09 20:20:32 <shom>	Yeah, the main thing there was to make your user part of the uinput group that owns uinput. But for me I had to directly own dev/uinput as an user to get it to work, but I'll dig into why the group ownership isn't working properly. But that allows kanata to run without root, what was the part I was trying to get to.
Mar 09 20:26:50 <naokotan1>	question is how many times can I write sudo kanata --cfg for how long this takes lol
Mar 09 20:39:37 <shom>	hahaha, what kind of changes did you make to your layout?
Mar 09 20:43:28 <naokotan1>	I just swaped ctrl and caps
Mar 09 20:43:39 <naokotan1>	but its a cool app. I will probably mess with it more
Mar 09 20:44:57 <sahil_>	I have ctrl on my right alt, escape on the caps, mod on the left thumb.
Mar 09 20:46:32 <SummerEmacs>	Party started. 🎉
Mar 09 20:46:36 <shom>	I use a Corne split keyboard with my desktop and have gotten very used to homerow mods and vim style arrows, so I made those changes and swapped ~ `
Mar 09 20:46:51 <shom>	o/ SummerEmacs woo!
Mar 09 20:47:30 <SummerEmacs>	🥳
Mar 09 20:47:45 <shom>	sahil_ what do you mean by mod on left thumb?
Mar 09 20:48:17 <sahil_>	shom: DWM uses windows key as the mod (mod 1 2 3 4.. 0) for workspaces and wm shortcuts as well
Mar 09 20:49:29 <shom>	ah gotcha, what key are you using on your left thumb?
Mar 09 20:50:15 <naokotan1>	I use option/windows/super and alt
Mar 09 20:53:34 <shom>	Good call, I should use reuse right alt, backspace here we come, tiny pinky relief ;)
Mar 09 21:00:29 <sahil_>	shom: [windowskey][alt] [                 spacebar             ][Ctrl(alt remapped)]
Mar 09 21:00:42 <sahil_>	and caps as escape
Mar 09 21:14:13 <shom>	sahil_: thanks for the ideas 
Mar 09 21:14:55 <sahil_>	Yeah, but I might get dwm thumbs now. 
Mar 09 22:59:49 <benoitj>	yeah, I use caps tab-hold firmware: hold => control, tap => escape
Mar 09 23:00:06 <benoitj>	I also have space + backspace is delete

Mar 10 03:08:30 <moshh>	I use caps lock as a second ctrl
Mar 10 03:09:57 <moshh>	I also have a 40% and for that I have ctrl on each layer. otherwise I think my fingers would hate me. 
Mar 10 03:10:00 <Marvin2>	I also turned 41 and man stuff doesn't heal as fast and I said you probably want to skip past powerful ARM desktops be viable?

Mar 10 03:10:54 <moshh>	lisp makes a lot more sense when you realise the original keyboards had ctrl right next to the space bar.

Mar 10 06:55:02 <trev>	daviwil: congratulations 
Mar 10 06:55:50 <trev>	you can start your 5 day a week streaming now, with my permission
Mar 10 06:55:50 <daviwil>	thanks!
Mar 10 06:56:01 <daviwil>	I think I need a Stallman avatar as a sidekick
Mar 10 06:56:22 <daviwil>	If streaming 5 days a week was sustainable, I'd do it
Mar 10 06:56:47 <naokotani>	hard to do that and not end up doing react content
Mar 10 06:56:57 <daviwil>	but it takes out a chunk of time that I could use for making actual videos that would be useful for people
Mar 10 06:56:59 <naokotani>	although, I am a big fan of react content
Mar 10 06:57:40 <daviwil>	react content is cheap and doesn't require preparation, so it's much easier to make
Mar 10 06:57:50 <naokotani>	if youa re streaming 5 days a week without an editor or producer y ou are probably actually working about 8 days a week
Mar 10 06:58:08 <daviwil>	naokotani: yes, that is for sure, if I'm trying to produce shorter videos from the VODs
Mar 10 06:58:29 <trev>	daviwil: i thought you wanted to do the primagean thing where you can cut a video out of a live stream?
Mar 10 06:58:31 <naokotani>	and you need to come up with content
Mar 10 06:58:36 <daviwil>	trev: I am still considering that
Mar 10 06:59:01 <daviwil>	but doing it slightly differently, the whole pretense of the stream is that I'm researching, writing, and recording the video content live
Mar 10 06:59:21 <daviwil>	rather than it just being a stream that I happen to farm a video out of via clips
Mar 10 06:59:56 <daviwil>	I'll be experimenting with a lot of different things over the next few months, trying to find an efficient model
Mar 10 07:00:01 <Marvin2>	I'll be sueing all of the opinion that rust works all the CIA blacksites might be a nice video series
Mar 10 07:00:34 <naokotani>	daviwil: there is a darktide streamer I watched and what he would do is what you say, research, during the stream and then once he had that done he would transition straight into video mode and then cut the video out of that
Mar 10 07:00:46 <daviwil>	yeah, that's basically what I'm thinking
Mar 10 07:01:20 <daviwil>	it could be interesting as a behind-the-scenes thing for folks who like watching the live streams
Mar 10 07:03:21 <thanosapollo>	minimal blog post on leaving vps services, I've setup my home server with cloudflare tunnel https://thanosapollo.org/post/bye-bye-vps/

Mar 10 07:03:44 <thanosapollo>	daviwil an anime avatar of RMS? 
Mar 10 07:04:43 <daviwil>	thanosapollo: nice! Post it to the forum too :) 
Mar 10 07:05:43 <naokotani>	I was thinking about doing a blog as a debriefing about my time with wsl and coming back to linux and then a bit aobut my new setup
Mar 10 07:05:46 <Marvin2>	I was generating a single person.
Mar 10 07:06:26 <naokotani>	It's that or talking about different SQL rust crates, which I assume aboslutely no one is interested to read
Mar 10 07:07:30 <naokotani>	I ended up realizing that what I was using isn't ideal because its not ansync which appanrently causes problems for error handling
Mar 10 07:07:33 <Marvin2>	I ended up taking more time, and unless I have permanetnly tainted myself with emacs for writing. I'm a Guix user.
Mar 10 07:07:42 <glenneth>	thanosapollo: interesting read
Mar 10 07:09:58 <glenneth>	i use tailscale and was looking for a way to host my own public web site
Mar 10 07:10:03 <naokotani>	I think now that internet is a lot better in canada hosting websites on your own hardware seems attractive
Mar 10 07:10:12 <thanosapollo>	glenneth: it's a sloppy quick written article, I should make a decent guide on hosting cgit+inginx soon though
Mar 10 07:10:14 <Marvin2>	glenneth: it's quite possible to make leader keys etc. for hydra usage?
Mar 10 07:10:23 <thanosapollo>	glenneth cloudflare is ideal for that, and free 
Mar 10 07:10:52 <thanosapollo>	tailscale is awesome
Mar 10 07:11:01 <glenneth>	i need to figure out the dns stuff for my domain
Mar 10 07:11:17 <naokotani>	so cloudflare can act as a proxy absically?
Mar 10 07:11:22 <thanosapollo>	cloudflare handles it 
Mar 10 07:11:36 <thanosapollo>	naokotani yeah, but they also provide dns & certs 
Mar 10 07:11:57 <glenneth>	hmmm
Mar 10 07:12:08 <naokotani>	you could also just use a vps to handle that and proxy to your server, but then you hav eto pay a minimal fee
Mar 10 07:12:39 <thanosapollo>	I used to have an ssh tunnel to a vps, but I want to avoid using vps services
Mar 10 07:12:49 <glenneth>	yup
Mar 10 07:12:50 <thanosapollo>	cloudflare tunnel provides better performance as well 
Mar 10 07:12:53 <naokotani>	why is that?
Mar 10 07:13:15 <thanosapollo>	naokotani it's in the article
Mar 10 07:14:10 <naokotani>	yeah I read it, but what's effectively the difference between a vps provider proxying to your server and cloudflare?
Mar 10 07:14:42 <naokotani>	a third party is handling your dns and certs in both cases
Mar 10 07:15:09 <shom>	Cloudflare has CDNs in a lot of zones, but Cloudflare is too entrenched into the web eco-system and you'll have seen how cloudflare outages brings down vast swaths of the web. Also, as thanosapollo pointed out that they can decrypt the traffic, so that makes me even more skeptical of Cloudflare aside from their business practices.
Mar 10 07:16:09 <shom>	thanosapollo I'm not a fan of Cloudflare but I'm not critiquing your personal choice.
Mar 10 07:16:57 <naokotani>	yeah, im not trying to argue or say you are wrong, just discussing it. At some point its choosing the least bad option
Mar 10 07:17:06 <shom>	glenneth if you're looking to host a static site (still) then you could use Sourcehut/Github/Codeberg Paged under your own domain
Mar 10 07:17:07 <thanosapollo>	neither option is ideal, cloudflare tunnel offers better performance than port forwarding to a vps, plus unlimited traffic, plus cloudflare security.  
Mar 10 07:17:36 <thanosapollo>	I do not have public ip nor do I want to poke holes in my firewall for now
Mar 10 07:17:44 <thanosapollo>	/s/public ip/static ip
Mar 10 07:18:44 <naokotani>	I also realistcally can't run a business for my home server
Mar 10 07:18:56 <naokotani>	we get too many hurricanes for that to work
Mar 10 07:19:02 <thanosapollo>	Depends on the home server lol 
Mar 10 07:19:32 <naokotani>	no like, its not the server, its wher emy home is relative to where hurricanes and winter storms off the north atlantic are
Mar 10 07:19:50 <shom>	thanosapollo hahaha yeah, some of these home labs run bigger rigs than a lot of medium sized businesses!
Mar 10 07:20:20 <naokotani>	I could get a generator and stuff but, the infrastructure here is jsut not reliable
Mar 10 07:20:30 <shom>	naokotani ahh yeah the noreaster a hurricane of snow, no thanks!
Mar 10 07:21:05 <naokotani>	100+ km/h wind and heavy snow is very normal weather here
Mar 10 07:21:43 <daviwil>	naokotani: speaking from experience, even hosting your business website from a "pages" host like GitHub or Codeberg can be a liability 
Mar 10 07:22:02 <shom>	Random question: does anyone use chat.sr.ht bouncer with Kiwiirc? I can't figure out the connection settings.
Mar 10 07:22:42 <naokotani>	yeah. a business has different needs. you really want like 99.99% uptime, but like if my blog goes down for 12 hours, who cares
Mar 10 07:23:16 <naokotani>	if I had the most popular blog on the internet and it went down for a few hours a few times a year I would probably not even care
Mar 10 07:23:18 <shom>	For a business, definitely better off not using a git forge's static pages function, it might even be against the terms of service of the company (pretty sure that's true for sourcehut)
Mar 10 07:24:22 <thanosapollo>	daviwil have you checked out depp? It's written in scheme https://depp.brause.cc/depp/

Mar 10 07:24:39 <naokotani>	does anyone else have the bad habit of writing cd and then cd into a directory instead of writing cd ~/?
Mar 10 07:25:12 <benoitj>	shom: you tried with sasl?
Mar 10 07:26:04 <benoitj>	naokotani: yeah,  faster
Mar 10 07:26:19 <naokotani>	which is faster?
Mar 10 07:26:30 <naokotani>	cd cd or cd ~/?
Mar 10 07:26:31 <benoitj>	 two commands
Mar 10 07:26:55 <naokotani>	just looking at it, I guess its literally the same number of characters
Mar 10 07:26:55 <thanosapollo>	why write cd ~/ and not just cd? 
Mar 10 07:27:18 <naokotani>	but cd is easier to type than cd ~/
Mar 10 07:27:29 <naokotani>	cd cd is easier*
Mar 10 07:28:41 <benoitj>	I understood, cd and cd something vs cd ~/somenthing
Mar 10 07:29:18 <naokotani>	yeah like cd<cr>cd/Documents vs. cd ~/Documents
Mar 10 07:29:18 <benoitj>	I try to avoid typing ~
Mar 10 07:29:27 <shom>	hi benoitj! I have been using sasl on revolution irc on android and it's been working fine, but not sure how to get the server configuration entered into KiwiIRC since they don't name/expose the fields the same way, the meta.sr.ht doc didn't help me out much.
Mar 10 07:30:13 <naokotani>	I use ~ all the time for mv and cp and idk. bash scripts
Mar 10 07:30:33 <naokotani>	but specfically for changing direcories I don't use it

Mar 10 07:31:42 <benoitj>	shom: I don't look back 😃
Mar 10 07:32:03 <naokotani>	that's like when someone said you should try to use things like diw instead of dw because diw is more useful with .
Mar 10 07:32:05 <Marvin2>	that's like my biggest procrastination task of the learning process. what do you like it?
Mar 10 07:32:16 <naokotani>	and I started doing it and its very common that it ends up being helpful
Mar 10 07:32:26 <benoitj>	shom: chat.sr.ht uses soju, you may find something there

Mar 10 07:34:18 <naokotani>	not me. i will press up arrow 15 times instead of writing ls
Mar 10 07:34:40 <benoitj>	I use Ctrl+r
Mar 10 07:36:31 <naokotani>	I was exagerating somewhat, but I do have a tendency to use the history very frequently

Mar 10 07:42:21 <naokotani>	promptwise ive been using starship
Mar 10 07:42:28 <naokotani>	I like how its cross platform
Mar 10 07:42:42 <naokotani>	it even works in powershell
Mar 10 07:42:44 <shom>	oh yeah, I also use starship
Mar 10 07:43:26 <naokotani>	its pretty minimal. mostly just my git status and current directory
Mar 10 07:43:40 <naokotani>	but I like having it consistent
Mar 10 07:43:41 <benoitj>	yeah, I do too. but I use less the shell now. mostly for ncspot
Mar 10 07:44:13 <benoitj>	^starship
Mar 10 07:44:15 <naokotani>	I use the shell constantly. I don't really use eshell or vterm
Mar 10 07:44:33 <benoitj>	I don't need to UAE 
Mar 10 07:44:39 <benoitj>	use it much
Mar 10 07:45:03 <benoitj>	and most of my new shell scripts are in babashka
Mar 10 07:45:06 <naokotani>	I went through a "I can make emacs do EVERYTHING phase"
Mar 10 07:46:53 <benoitj>	my top shell command: make, bb, gradle jar, mvn install, ncspot
Mar 10 07:47:36 <benoitj>	Emacs and intellij always open it in the right place, so rarely cd 
Mar 10 07:49:43 <naokotani>	I have no idea what top ones are. probably cd mv and cp
Mar 10 07:49:54 <naokotani>	rm
Mar 10 07:50:16 <benoitj>	naokotani: I don't think it's the same phase,  I don't tell myself that. on my latest nix migration, I got rid of lots of shell tools I figured I don't use them anymore
Mar 10 07:50:59 <naokotani>	oh, I am not making comments on your phase. Just I used to use eshell/vterm and I got over it
Mar 10 07:51:08 <benoitj>	I use dired
Mar 10 07:51:34 <trev>	is it still considered gnu/linux if you're using nix and remove all the gnu utils??
Mar 10 07:51:53 <benoitj>	I went through that too 😃
Mar 10 07:51:57 <naokotani>	yeah same. I use them interchably. if im in my shell I use that, if im in emacs i use dired
Mar 10 07:52:25 <benoitj>	trev: it's still Linux
Mar 10 07:52:38 <shom>	 I'm a very low skill user of dired and embark but my word that's powerful\
Mar 10 07:52:39 <naokotani>	its just not gnu plus linux
Mar 10 07:53:52 <thanosapollon>	naokotani my emacs does everything lol 😂
Mar 10 07:54:16 <benoitj>	it's whatever you want to name it ;)
Mar 10 07:55:27 <BigEatie>	+1 for starship
Mar 10 07:55:31 <naokotani>	thanosapollon: different strokes for different folks. tbh im probably a bit odd in teh sense that I use nvim and emacs and dired adn the shell totally randomly and interchangably
Mar 10 07:56:22 <thanosapollon>	eshell is awesome tho, if you tramp somewhere that doesn't have gnu utils it always saves me 
Mar 10 07:56:54 <thanosapollon>	Especially for htb challenges etc 
Mar 10 07:57:20 <thanosapollon>	I have no idea about windows or power shell commands

Mar 10 08:27:04 *	nm0i slaps naokotani with a dictionary.
Mar 10 08:27:49 <naokotani>	way is wrong wit u?
Mar 10 08:28:26 <nm0i>	...It's just some casual irc violence... Nothing unusual.
Mar 10 08:45:50 <glenneth>	lol
Mar 10 08:52:59 *	trev rm -rf's naokotani's anime folder
Mar 10 08:55:01 <cow_2001>	nooo
Mar 10 08:56:02 *	cow_2001 slaps trev around a bit with a large Guts swinging his Dragonslayer figurine
Mar 10 08:56:54 <naokotani>	I actually don't watch anime
Mar 10 08:57:36 <naokotani>	my japanese username would suggest that Im a weeabo, but 
Mar 10 08:58:15 <naokotani>	the history is that I couldn't come up with a name for my female draenai death knight so I used my ex girlfriends name (amicable terms, I left japan) who happened to be japanese
Mar 10 08:58:59 <naokotani>	so then I ended up using the name a bunch in WoW and then stuck with it
Mar 10 08:59:18 <naokotani>	That's actually a little known historical fact
Mar 10 09:00:00 <glenneth>	haha.  Thanks for sharing
Mar 10 09:00:36 <naokotani>	you wanna know how we met?
Mar 10 09:00:40 <naokotani>	Nao Kotani and me?
Mar 10 09:02:02 <cow_2001>	in wow?
Mar 10 09:03:39 <naokotani>	No. I was at an all you can drink event at a pizza shop owned by albanians in Japan and I had no idea who she was but decided to just picker her up and dance around with room with her like a maniac
Mar 10 09:04:01 <naokotani>	she appanrelty thought this was great and asked the owner of the pizza store for my number the next day
Mar 10 09:04:46 <cow_2001>	how did they know it was you?
Mar 10 09:04:55 <cow_2001>	i mean, the owners
Mar 10 09:05:10 <cow_2001>	and your number?  how did they have your number?
Mar 10 09:05:39 <naokotani>	They didn't. I actually didn't have a phone
Mar 10 09:05:50 <naokotani>	they got in touch with my neighbour, who they knew
Mar 10 09:06:13 <cow_2001>	does she know about your nickname?
Mar 10 09:06:25 <naokotani>	I sure hope not lol
Mar 10 09:07:11 <naokotani>	We only dated a few months. I just couldn't htink of a name for my death knight
Mar 10 09:07:24 <naokotani>	but then I ended up raiding on that character for quite a while
Mar 10 09:07:34 <cow_2001>	unfortunate
Mar 10 09:07:54 <naokotani>	why?
Mar 10 09:08:30 <cow_2001>	iuno.  in general.  these things lead to heartbreak
Mar 10 09:08:36 <cow_2001>	i really need to sleep
Mar 10 09:08:40 <cow_2001>	good night
Mar 10 09:11:00 <glenneth>	nite cow_2001 
Mar 10 09:11:32 <naokotani>	oh. I don't think anyone's heart was broken
Mar 10 09:11:38 <naokotani>	I mean i have no idea I guess
Mar 10 09:11:42 <naokotani>	Mine wasnt
Mar 10 09:41:16 <trev>	naokotani: i hope her character's name is your real name too
Mar 10 09:41:19 <trev>	that'd be somethin
Mar 10 09:41:48 <naokotani>	My real name is Chris Hughes
Mar 10 10:32:49 <daviwil>	My real name is Leland Palmer but my friends call me Bob
Mar 10 11:13:31 <trev>	hi bob
Mar 10 12:15:49 <ehrt74>	oh boy i just spent 2 hours fighting with a sway config file :D

Mar 10 16:41:56 <naokotani>	when using the daemon. its been a while but iirc it dosen't have access to everything it needs for the client when it starts or smoething because its got no gui

Mar 10 16:58:39 <Fade>	the irish component of my genepool really loves a good session with the guitars in the middle of a party.
Mar 10 16:58:48 <shom>	hi daviwil, no ragrets, unless big tattoo sized ragrets
Mar 10 16:59:22 <daviwil>	Freebird

Mar 10 16:59:55 <SummerEmacs>	from sting
Mar 10 16:59:59 <SummerEmacs>	the soul cages
Mar 10 17:00:00 <shom>	Fade: that's lovely unless it's one bro who only knows wonderwall
Mar 10 17:00:06 <SummerEmacs>	such a beautiful album
Mar 10 17:00:30 <Fade>	his arrangements are surprisingly complex.
Mar 10 17:00:42 <SummerEmacs>	i love his music
Mar 10 17:00:44 <SummerEmacs>	it's so beautiful

Mar 10 17:03:54 <SummerEmacs>	daviwil: ooh i love that one too
Mar 10 17:04:00 *	Fade falls into the Prince hole
Mar 10 17:04:05 <naokotani>	daviwil: your emacs daemon article saved the day
Mar 10 17:04:16 <SummerEmacs>	i'm using consult-mu now it's fantastic
Mar 10 17:04:31 <daviwil>	naokotani: great!
Mar 10 17:04:40 <SummerEmacs>	i can imagine using this with embark too
Mar 10 17:04:52 <Fade>	I need to fix my mail transport daemon.
Mar 10 17:04:54 *	Fade sighs
Mar 10 17:04:56 <naokotani>	an properly written article is so much more useful than stack overflow textual vomit
Mar 10 17:06:02 <naokotani>	but if you google something the top hits are always stack overflow articles from 2019 about some really tangentially related problem
Mar 10 17:06:04 <glenneth_>	hey Folx. How is everyone doing?  All good I hope 😁
Mar 10 17:06:05 <Marvin2>	but if it was fascinating and religious. And there was nuance that I like. yeah, that's luck
Mar 10 17:06:10 <SummerEmacs>	hi ⚡️Ω🐪⚡️ 
Mar 10 17:06:33 <glenneth_>	hey SummerEmacs o/
Mar 10 17:07:25 <shom>	SummerEmacs: it was more of a meme from the late 90s and early 2000s where bros (then known as dudes) would learn only one verse of wonderwall with the sole intent to bringing a guitar to a party to "pick up girls". I love wonderwall the song!
Mar 10 17:07:45 <SummerEmacs>	oh lol ok
Mar 10 17:07:51 <SummerEmacs>	yea it's a great song
Mar 10 17:07:59 <naokotani>	shom: that actually sounds pretty effective
Mar 10 17:08:08 <naokotani>	blows the socks off standiing in a corner looking akward
Mar 10 17:08:17 <glenneth_>	no! No it isn't. it's an awful song
Mar 10 17:08:24 <SummerEmacs>	i love it
Mar 10 17:08:27 <SummerEmacs>	i love the whole album
Mar 10 17:08:36 <naokotani>	its fine
Mar 10 17:08:44 <glenneth_>	so disappointed. talentless hacks
Mar 10 17:09:00 <shom>	Now wonderwall is stuck in my head, it's a great ear worm
Mar 10 17:09:02 <naokotani>	writing catchy music is a talent
Mar 10 17:09:06 <SummerEmacs>	i'm putting it on now
Mar 10 17:09:21 <SummerEmacs>	Hello
Mar 10 17:09:22 <naokotani>	more of a radiohead enjoyer my own self
Mar 10 17:09:33 <SummerEmacs>	i have all radiohead too
Mar 10 17:09:33 <glenneth_>	yes! 
Mar 10 17:09:33 <naokotani>	probably beacuse im a creep, im a weirdo
Mar 10 17:09:51 <naokotani>	weirdoooooooooo
Mar 10 17:09:53 <naokotani>	*
Mar 10 17:10:06 <naokotani>	weirdOOOoooOOOoooo*
Mar 10 17:10:14 <shom>	Radiohead is my favorite band but I do like some Oasis stuff too, beefing fandoms is just weird to me
Mar 10 17:10:31 <SummerEmacs>	don't look back in anger is my favorite from that album tho (what's the story morning glory)
Mar 10 17:10:40 <naokotani>	shom: Humans have been beefing fandoms since cave peoople days. 
Mar 10 17:10:45 <SummerEmacs>	which is right after wonderwall
Mar 10 17:10:48 <glenneth_>	Just no
Mar 10 17:10:54 <naokotani>	politics is basically beefing fandoms with guns
Mar 10 17:11:00 <Fade>	see also: Muse
Mar 10 17:11:07 <SummerEmacs>	lol
Mar 10 17:11:14 <SummerEmacs>	we're torturing glenneth i think
Mar 10 17:11:41 <SummerEmacs>	i'm putting it on
Mar 10 17:11:44 <shom>	I'm a crepe, I'm a weir-dough
Mar 10 17:11:44 <SummerEmacs>	don't look back in anger
Mar 10 17:11:46 <SummerEmacs>	i love that song
Mar 10 17:11:53 <naokotani>	actually in some countries soccer is beefing fandoms with guns
Mar 10 17:11:54 <glenneth_>	I like Muse. it's just Oasis. should have never existed
Mar 10 17:11:57 <Marvin2>	I like the Tailscale business model. Make a fresh batch together
Mar 10 17:12:07 <naokotani>	but in those countries is football
Mar 10 17:12:20 <naokotani>	good idea Marvin2!
Mar 10 17:12:23 <Fade>	Oasis is the personality disordered child of the beatles and the rolling stones.
Mar 10 17:12:33 <Fade>	they did make some pretty good pop-rock, though.
Mar 10 17:12:37 <SummerEmacs>	i've heard that or something similar
Mar 10 17:12:48 *	glenneth_ hides among The Fake Plastic Trees 
Mar 10 17:12:53 <Fade>	which is odd, because i'm a fan of neither the beatles or the rolling stones.
Mar 10 17:12:59 <SummerEmacs>	i love both
Mar 10 17:13:03 <naokotani>	I guess champagne supernova has strawberry fields vibes
Mar 10 17:13:07 <Marvin2>	I guess nobody is here to prepare for on sat night
Mar 10 17:13:13 <Fade>	I love some of each bands songs
Mar 10 17:13:19 <SummerEmacs>	one of my first rock songs ever was sympathy for the devil
Mar 10 17:13:19 <shom>	glenneth_: is having a low flying panic attack
Mar 10 17:13:29 <Fade>	but I'm very far from a completist, and I have to be in a very particular mood for the beatles.
Mar 10 17:13:36 <naokotani>	I don't love any of them, but they are fine for relaxed/passive listening
Mar 10 17:13:39 <glenneth_>	you're all leaving me High and Dry
Mar 10 17:13:39 <SummerEmacs>	oh i listen to the beatles a lot
Mar 10 17:13:47 <naokotani>	personally I only really listen to hip hop
Mar 10 17:13:55 <glenneth_>	hate the Beatles. Love the stones
Mar 10 17:14:07 <SummerEmacs>	you do you 🙃 
Mar 10 17:14:10 <SummerEmacs>	i love the beatles
Mar 10 17:14:11 <Fade>	rubber sould was good
Mar 10 17:14:22 <Fade>	large parts of seargeant pepper
Mar 10 17:14:27 <naokotani>	beatles are like vscode. over rated with a bloated GUI
Mar 10 17:14:32 <Fade>	even the white album.
Mar 10 17:14:48 <SummerEmacs>	i have all of the beatles
Mar 10 17:14:55 <SummerEmacs>	and i can play most of it tbh it's not too hard
Mar 10 17:14:58 <Fade>	Beggars Banquet was great
Mar 10 17:15:04 <Fade>	Exile on Main Street
Mar 10 17:15:07 <naokotani>	SummerEmacs: you should probably let them out of your basement
Mar 10 17:15:13 <shom>	glenneth_: I quoted a lyric and felt everything in its right place
Mar 10 17:15:13 <SummerEmacs>	haha
Mar 10 17:15:19 <SummerEmacs>	my basement is like..medieval
Mar 10 17:15:22 <SummerEmacs>	nothing lives down there
Mar 10 17:15:28 <Fade>	ahhh, the caverns of Paris.
Mar 10 17:15:29 <SummerEmacs>	it's just great for storing wine and stuff
Mar 10 17:15:31 <SummerEmacs>	yea
Mar 10 17:15:42 <SummerEmacs>	i mean it's literally medieval
Mar 10 17:15:46 <SummerEmacs>	i'd have to ask sandrine she's the expert
Mar 10 17:15:48 <Fade>	la cave
Mar 10 17:15:49 <Marvin2>	i'd have to figure out what you are insane
Mar 10 17:15:58 <glenneth_>	revolver  tomorrow never knows. The one and only decent Beatles track
Mar 10 17:16:09 <SummerEmacs>	OK Go
Mar 10 17:16:11 <SummerEmacs>	love those guys
Mar 10 17:16:29 <glenneth_>	yes
Mar 10 17:16:41 <glenneth_>	nice quip shom 😁
Mar 10 17:16:48 *	Fade opens a python file and watches his emacs fall into paroxysms of angst trying to start a language server and failing
Mar 10 17:16:54 <SummerEmacs>	haha
Mar 10 17:17:03 *	naokotani recommends pycharm
Mar 10 17:17:10 <SummerEmacs>	here it goes again (just put on the video)
Mar 10 17:17:14 <SummerEmacs>	it's brilliant
Mar 10 17:17:38 <Fade>	I think I need some heavy devy after all of this dad rock
Mar 10 17:17:49 <SummerEmacs>	OK Go isn't dad rock
Mar 10 17:17:55 <SummerEmacs>	my dad doesn't really know them much at all
Mar 10 17:17:58 <shom>	Beatles are just okay in isolation, they're significant in the historical context though. Sure someone else might have mainstreamed stuff but they didn't Beatles did, respect where it's due and the music is very pleasant
Mar 10 17:18:05 <Fade>	I was thinking beatles and stones
Mar 10 17:18:10 <glenneth_>	recently listening to English Teacher, say she she and the new one from Kim Gordon
Mar 10 17:18:10 <SummerEmacs>	oh that's def dad rock
Mar 10 17:18:11 <Fade>	OK go is a different thing.
Mar 10 17:18:14 <Marvin2>	recently listening to stuff today so it doesn't exist any more.
Mar 10 17:18:25 <SummerEmacs>	imma put on welcome to the black parade after this
Mar 10 17:18:27 <Marvin2>	imma put on the web version, so there was enough work
Mar 10 17:18:29 <SummerEmacs>	i always listen to the whole album
Mar 10 17:18:31 <SummerEmacs>	it's fantastic
Mar 10 17:18:50 <Fade>	I sense some Daft Punk in the wings
Mar 10 17:19:05 <Fade>	maybe some Muse
Mar 10 17:19:06 <shom>	OK Go is great, I should listen to them more
Mar 10 17:19:29 <Fade>	but for right now, it's the large Canadian with a voice like gabriel's trumpet
Mar 10 17:19:31 <Marvin2>	but for some syntax highlighting. this was the final exercises.
Mar 10 17:19:40 <glenneth_>	Just putting on LCD Soundsystem
Mar 10 17:19:50 <shom>	Yes Daft Punk!!! Their Tron soundtrack is an absolute banger too.
Mar 10 17:19:59 <Fade>	Tron Legacy... so good.
Mar 10 17:20:01 <glenneth_>	because Daft Punk are playing at my house 😁
Mar 10 17:20:05 <SummerEmacs>	The End.
Mar 10 17:20:08 <SummerEmacs>	such a great opening
Mar 10 17:20:13 <naokotani>	I think we can all agree on daft punk
Mar 10 17:20:24 <SummerEmacs>	i'm listening to MCR
Mar 10 17:20:30 <naokotani>	though I don't love daft punk
Mar 10 17:20:33 <SummerEmacs>	the whole album Welcome to the Black Parade
Mar 10 17:20:35 <SummerEmacs>	it's 🔥 
Mar 10 17:20:37 <naokotani>	good for passive/relaxed listening
Mar 10 17:20:49 <SummerEmacs>	it's so much like The Wall in a way
Mar 10 17:20:53 <shom>	The end is th beginning is the end by the Pumpkins, also great and they used it in The Watchmen movie
Mar 10 17:20:56 <SummerEmacs>	but with that early 2000s indie rock angst
Mar 10 17:21:24 <glenneth_>	shom: excellent track. awesome band
Mar 10 17:21:55 <shom>	naokotani: what's some good hiphop you're spinning recently?

Mar 10 17:23:03 <glenneth_>	same shom they were great. until D'Arcy left
Mar 10 17:23:05 <SummerEmacs>	gotta play some of this
Mar 10 17:23:05 <Marvin2>	same shom they were in windows and I was writing three
Mar 10 17:23:06 <Fade>	I saw Radiohead at the Hippodrome in london when they were doing Pablo Honey
Mar 10 17:23:31 <Fade>	pretty small show
Mar 10 17:23:47 <glenneth_>	The Heineken centre in Amsterdam. last time I saw radio head. moon shaped pool tour 
Mar 10 17:23:57 <shom>	glenneth_: yeah... the lineup has been :/ but incredible talent
Mar 10 17:24:19 <naokotani>	shom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXN6XipidU0 oops I didn't @ you properly

Mar 10 17:24:26 <Fade>	I haven't seen Muse, but I'd like to.
Mar 10 17:24:31 <naokotani>	wtb delete message
Mar 10 17:24:56 <SummerEmacs>	i love this guitar solo
Mar 10 17:24:58 <Fade>	my taste for hiphop is quite limited.
Mar 10 17:25:03 <SummerEmacs>	it has a woody woodpecker tune in it
Mar 10 17:25:05 <SummerEmacs>	deliberately
Mar 10 17:25:08 <SummerEmacs>	brilliant
Mar 10 17:25:23 <Fade>	which solo?
Mar 10 17:25:25 <glenneth_>	I saw Muse play at some university student gig just before their first album was released. They were amazing then Fade even better now
Mar 10 17:25:27 <Marvin2>	I saw a screenshot
Mar 10 17:25:34 <SummerEmacs>	in Dead! on welcome to the black parade
Mar 10 17:25:40 <Fade>	glenneth_: yeah, that would have been wicked
Mar 10 17:25:41 <SummerEmacs>	it's a great guitar bit
Mar 10 17:26:01 <shom>	Fade: that's amazing but I probably wouldn't have loved Pablo Honey era Radiohead, it was imporant context though. I saw them in Chicago in 2018 and it was just incredible best music experience for me
Mar 10 17:26:23 <naokotani>	hip hop is maybe an aqcuired taste
Mar 10 17:26:29 <glenneth_>	I've seen Radio head for every album tour
Mar 10 17:26:38 <shom>	Thanks naokotani, I love hiphop too
Mar 10 17:27:00 <Fade>	just as Pablo was dropping. they weren't yet famous.
Mar 10 17:27:04 <glenneth_>	same with Depeche Mode
Mar 10 17:27:05 <naokotani>	that channel in general has a lot of really good 90s/2000s mixes
Mar 10 17:27:07 <Marvin2>	that channel in general terms, but not the recording i'm listening to his name
Mar 10 17:27:38 <Fade>	I like some Public Enemy, and some NWA
Mar 10 17:27:50 <Fade>	I like some hip hop inflected music, like Bran Van 3000
Mar 10 17:27:52 <shom>	glenneth_: that's incredible, I could finally afford to in 2018, so jelly
Mar 10 17:27:54 <SummerEmacs>	i don't really listen to it naokotani except if i'm partying and it is on. but generally i don't like it tbh.
Mar 10 17:28:19 <naokotani>	SummerEmacs: that's basicall me with oasis
Mar 10 17:28:22 <SummerEmacs>	i like it when it's used sparingly and then it can be amazing
Mar 10 17:28:25 <Fade>	there's just not enough music most of the time in hip hop.
Mar 10 17:28:45 <glenneth_>	my hip hop started and ended with De La Soul 😁 I thought they were incredible
Mar 10 17:28:47 <shom>	naokotani: that's a great mix, I know and love some of those tracks
Mar 10 17:28:49 <Fade>	I liked Outkast
Mar 10 17:28:49 <naokotani>	I like hip hop when its on 24/7 and I turn it off when I need to do careful reading
Mar 10 17:28:52 <SummerEmacs>	yea it's not really music it's rhyming with sampling and some of it tbh is amazing but most if it is just not my genre at all
Mar 10 17:29:03 <SummerEmacs>	outkast was great
Mar 10 17:29:19 <SummerEmacs>	key & peele outkast was just as amazing 😀 
Mar 10 17:29:23 <naokotani>	Have you listnted to MF Doom much? like operation doomsday?
Mar 10 17:29:39 <Fade>	I've heard you mention this before, but I don't know it
Mar 10 17:29:50 <SummerEmacs>	key & peele?
Mar 10 17:29:54 <Fade>	my favourite band is Pink Floyd
Mar 10 17:30:00 <SummerEmacs>	i love floyd
Mar 10 17:30:06 <shom>	MF Doom is heavy and fluid at the same time
Mar 10 17:30:09 <glenneth_>	Fade: nice
Mar 10 17:30:10 <naokotani>	I like Pink Floyd when I was a teenager

Mar 10 17:31:23 <Fade>	that video is geolocked. I can't watch it.
Mar 10 17:31:26 <SummerEmacs>	can't play guitar to your stuff naokotani 😀 
Mar 10 17:31:27 <shom>	Speaking of Key & Peele. Their Epic Rap Battles of History as MLK and Gandhi is GOLD! 
Mar 10 17:31:40 <naokotani>	It has a baseline
Mar 10 17:31:53 <Fade>	perhaps after Devin Townsend, I will segue to Carlos Santana
Mar 10 17:31:54 <SummerEmacs>	doesn't really qualify 😛 
Mar 10 17:32:24 <Fade>	there's only like two chords in that track, naokotani 
Mar 10 17:32:32 <shom>	https://youtu.be/-6G6CZT7h4k?feature=shared
Mar 10 17:32:34 <Fade>	so in one sense, it'd be very easy to play guitar to.

Mar 10 17:33:50 <SummerEmacs>	sry it just hit welcome to the black parade so i gottga play
Mar 10 17:34:17 <SummerEmacs>	epic
Mar 10 17:34:42 <Fade>	i believe it's possible to definitively characterise pop music as three chords and an inversion in the chorus.

Mar 10 17:50:28 <Fade>	it has a tiling mode I haven't tried, but I run KDE on my laptop when I travel.
Mar 10 17:51:48 <Fade>	the wayland compositor also just works out of the box with my laptop's nVidia quadro GPU.
Mar 10 17:52:13 <Fade>	using the binary drivers
Mar 10 17:55:42 <trev>	Fade: running it on the laptop to look normal in front of onlookers?
Mar 10 17:56:05 <Fade>	mostly for the very stable and easy network integration
Mar 10 17:56:16 <Fade>	I hate managing wifi from the commandline.
Mar 10 17:56:34 <Fade>	but also, screen sharing and that kind of thing.
Mar 10 17:56:38 <Marvin2>	but also, because they rely on an old fork of st I still think it's on itunes later too
Mar 10 17:57:34 <SummerEmacs>	i like when i'm traveling and people see me working in emacs
Mar 10 17:57:40 <SummerEmacs>	they're all like wow she's pretty awesome
Mar 10 17:58:23 <SummerEmacs>	especially with my full screen setup they can't really figure it out
Mar 10 17:58:38 <Fade>	I used to run stumpwm on a 17" G4 powerbook, which was a spectacle that gave one very mac-focused graphical designer at a client site an anxiety attack.
Mar 10 17:58:40 <SummerEmacs>	cuz ther'es no folders or icons or anything except for my emoji and all text and weird code stuff at times
Mar 10 17:58:54 <SummerEmacs>	haha
Mar 10 17:59:07 <Fade>	f'real. I had to close the machine and console him.
Mar 10 17:59:15 <SummerEmacs>	i get a lot of questions when i'm running emacs in public
Mar 10 17:59:16 <Fade>	(no pun intended)
Mar 10 17:59:29 <SummerEmacs>	i actually showed it off on one of the plane trips i took recently. somebody next to me asked me what i was doing
Mar 10 17:59:39 <Fade>	SummerEmacs: that, and also, I didn't use the mouse at all, even for the web browser.
Mar 10 17:59:41 <SummerEmacs>	so i gave him a one hour intro to emacs
Mar 10 17:59:46 <SummerEmacs>	yea see i dont' either
Mar 10 17:59:48 <SummerEmacs>	i have vimium
Mar 10 17:59:55 <SummerEmacs>	so i just use vim keys
Mar 10 18:00:05 <Fade>	at the time I was using a browser called Conqueror
Mar 10 18:00:07 <SummerEmacs>	and then in inbput fields/text fields in safari i use emacs keybindings
Mar 10 18:00:16 <Fade>	which was made by the same guy who made stump and ratpoison before that.
Mar 10 18:00:22 <Fade>	it was all hyper-emacs-focused.
Mar 10 18:00:26 <SummerEmacs>	dunno it but awesome
Mar 10 18:00:42 <SummerEmacs>	but yea i use safari with the keybinds it's great
Mar 10 18:00:47 <Fade>	it unfortunately no longer exists. happily Nyxt is becoming a real thing.
Mar 10 18:01:03 <SummerEmacs>	yea i'm interested in nyxt but agaijn i prefer safari still overall
Mar 10 18:01:09 <Fade>	anyhow, the effect was that of a wall of very small text
Mar 10 18:01:13 <SummerEmacs>	mostly cuzx it also syncs everything with my other devices instantly
Mar 10 18:01:15 <Marvin2>	mostly cuzx it also syncs everything with my sidebar
Mar 10 18:01:15 <Fade>	with no pictures anywhere
Mar 10 18:01:24 <Fade>	graphics boy started hyperventilating.
Mar 10 18:01:25 <SummerEmacs>	but i do use eww and sometimes xwidgets in emacs
Mar 10 18:02:27 <Fade>	<Fade> Yeah, *this* is what it means to be a digital native. You should get a good computer!
Mar 10 18:03:16 <Fade>	<gboy> ??...!!!
Mar 10 18:03:44 <Fade>	I think he had to go to an apple store and lie down in a hyperbaric chamber with a macbook pro and an iphone for three hours.
Mar 10 18:04:09 <Fade>	<Manager> Fade is not real. Fade cannot hurt you.
Mar 10 18:04:12 <Marvin2>	<Manager> Fade is an absolute banger too.
Mar 10 18:04:21 <Fade>	so much truth in one day.
Mar 10 18:05:06 <Fade>	I think this poor guy would be even more profoundly affected by Summer's stealthy deviance. :)
Mar 10 18:06:10 <naokotani>	any advice on how to get weechat to auto enter my password?
Mar 10 18:06:15 <Fade>	she looks so sweet and relatable, and then POW! EEEEEEMACS!!!
Mar 10 18:06:39 <naokotani>	Just becasue im sweet and relatable doesn't mean I can't be techy fade

Mar 10 19:18:49 <Fade>	although given the zeitgeist, it would be useful to have a decent webcam/mic setup in pretty much any professional programming context.
Mar 10 19:19:19 <Fade>	I tend to use my laptop for this, but it's not ideal, because when I'm on zoom or whatever and working through a problem, I'm rarely looking at the caller.
Mar 10 19:25:33 <naokotani>	yeah I want to get more into tutoring
Mar 10 19:25:36 <naokotani>	so I want a nice mic and cam

Mar 10 19:26:21 <naokotani>	my latop one is... funcitonal
Mar 10 19:26:21 <Fade>	for the past ten years or so, it has just been whatever is in my laptop or phone.
Mar 10 19:29:34 <Fade>	silicon graphics used to ship a webcam with the indy, which was quite novel at the time, but very low res.

Mar 10 19:41:28 <BiggerEatier>	I need recommendations on music for focusing...
Mar 10 19:41:45 <Fade>	I have a collection of asteroid music I use for that purpose
Mar 10 19:41:53 <Fade>	mostly ambient and rhytmic techno.
Mar 10 19:41:59 <BiggerEatier>	Until around a month ago I'd use mostly movie scores, but looking for something different... trying lofi, synthwave, other stuff, whatever you guys think
Mar 10 19:42:09 <BiggerEatier>	Asteroid music, sounds interesting
Mar 10 19:42:12 <BiggerEatier>	I'll look it up
Mar 10 19:42:20 <Fade>	that's just what I call it
Mar 10 19:42:33 <BiggerEatier>	What would youtube call it lol
Mar 10 19:42:41 <Fade>	the SomaFM channel "DeepSpace One" is a pretty good example of this kind of music.
Mar 10 19:43:08 <Fade>	I believe the genre description is 'ambient techno'
Mar 10 19:43:36 <Fade>	although I've also found Underworld good when I'm already wired in and focused. Everything Everything keeps me there.
Mar 10 19:43:57 <Fade>	all that said, what you are asking is intrinsically subjective.
Mar 10 19:44:24 <Fade>	I know a guy who listens almost exclusively to a band that makes Klingon Opera when he's working.
Mar 10 19:44:27 <Fade>	lol
Mar 10 19:45:28 <BiggerEatier>	Fair point, figured I'd get a few different opinions -- a lot of it tends to be instrumental, chill music, so I figured I'd get some of that
Mar 10 19:45:46 <Fade>	I find music with lyrics distracting to my focus
Mar 10 19:45:54 <BiggerEatier>	I could dig DeepSpace One ... sounds good so far
Mar 10 19:46:09 <Fade>	:)
Mar 10 19:59:24 <naokotani>	lyrics don't bother me, but I absolutely cannot read with music on
Mar 10 19:59:45 <naokotani>	I can write code fine
Mar 10 19:59:57 <naokotani>	but like reading a docs or a pdf, its impossible
Mar 10 20:24:16 <naokotani>	daviwil: do you have any good advice for a mic?
Mar 10 20:24:29 <naokotani>	https://www.amazon.ca/HyperX-QuadCast-Condenser-Microphone-Anti-Vibration/dp/B08G8WH435?th=1
Mar 10 20:24:45 <naokotani>	https://www.amazon.ca/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?th=1
Mar 10 20:24:52 <naokotani>	been looking at these ones. idk much about it
Mar 10 20:26:12 <naokotani>	or anyone else wise in the way of mics
Mar 10 20:26:48 <BiggerEatier>	 I like the Blue Yeti a lot
Mar 10 20:26:53 <BiggerEatier>	Get pretty good sound from it.
Mar 10 20:27:03 <naokotani>	do you have an arm for it?
Mar 10 20:28:14 <BiggerEatier>	I do not, if I was getting more serious about youtubing I'd probably consider it though
Mar 10 20:31:01 <naokotani>	I'm not going to be youtubing, it would be for teaching
Mar 10 20:31:18 <naokotani>	well idk I might try streaming one day
Mar 10 20:34:12 <BiggerEatier>	Same considerations from the mic I would think?
Mar 10 20:34:19 <BiggerEatier>	for the mic*
Mar 10 20:34:51 <BiggerEatier>	I thought that even without the arm it was easy enough to have the mic on a desk and get decent sound out of it
Mar 10 20:35:28 <naokotani>	I'm worried about it picking up my keyboard
Mar 10 20:35:44 <BiggerEatier>	That it definitely does
Mar 10 20:35:45 <naokotani>	I have pretty quiet linear switches, but its still a mechanical keyboard
Mar 10 20:35:55 <naokotani>	ok, well then I will probably get an arm
Mar 10 20:37:10 <BiggerEatier>	Even those that use an arm seem to get it some, though
Mar 10 20:37:53 <naokotani>	well the less the better. it is a fairly quiet keyboard
Mar 10 20:38:12 <naokotani>	trying to remember the switches
Mar 10 20:38:43 <BiggerEatier>	Not sure if you watch distrotube much, but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6LuV7Pl2YU&t=98s
Mar 10 20:38:55 <BiggerEatier>	He spends quite a bit of time on getting his audio right, has a condenser mic, mic arm and all
Mar 10 20:38:58 <naokotani>	I like distrotube. I find his accent calming
Mar 10 20:39:04 <BiggerEatier>	Still get quite a bit of clickity clack from his keyboard
Mar 10 20:39:21 <naokotani>	oh, yeah i assume he goes out of his way to get good sound. he seems really professional
Mar 10 20:39:59 <naokotani>	lol I can immediately tell he has a much much louder keyboard than me
Mar 10 20:46:54 <naokotani>	https://www.amazon.ca/Gateron-Switches-%EF%BC%8CMechanical-Keyboard-Mechanical/dp/B09JSM1911?th=1
Mar 10 20:47:01 <naokotani>	that's what im using atm
Mar 10 20:47:37 <BiggerEatier>	Nice, don't think I'm familiar with those.
Mar 10 20:48:01 <naokotani>	linear, very quiet
Mar 10 20:48:06 <BiggerEatier>	Probably my wife would like them, she hates how load my keyboard is, I think I have the cherry mx brown, which aren't supposed to be too loud
Mar 10 20:48:26 <naokotani>	is your keyboard hot swapable?
Mar 10 20:48:31 <BiggerEatier>	I think so
Mar 10 20:48:50 <naokotani>	if you want quieter I can recommand these gatreon yellow
Mar 10 20:48:55 <naokotani>	they are cheap too
Mar 10 20:49:03 <BiggerEatier>	Thanks man, I'll keep that in mind
Mar 10 20:49:23 <BiggerEatier>	Was actually thinking about swapping my keyboard out for an ergo keyboard
Mar 10 20:50:39 <naokotani>	Im pretty happy with my 60%
Mar 10 20:50:53 <naokotani>	I was getting some pain but it wa actually my chair height causing it
Mar 10 20:51:20 <BiggerEatier>	I get upper back pain these days, was thinking about a split keyboard with the hope being that a more opened up position might help
Mar 10 20:58:27 <naokotani>	if you want want to open up your back you could try utananasa
Mar 10 20:58:35 <naokotani>	followed by shashakasana
Mar 10 20:59:12 <naokotani>	sorry ustrasana
Mar 10 20:59:30 <naokotani>	uttanasana is good too, could do that along with sun salutations
Mar 10 21:06:02 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi

Mar 10 21:19:27 <BiggerEatier>	Hey summer
Mar 10 21:20:15 <BiggerEatier>	naokotani: Never tried yoga before, you're not the first person to suggest that.
Mar 10 21:20:48 <BiggerEatier>	I might look into it. I had been invited by an acquaitance to check out a local class once.
Mar 10 21:22:16 <BiggerEatier>	Sems like I losed my connection, so not sure if my last few messages went through, but you're not the first person to recommend trying yoga, I might check that out.

Mar 10 21:40:03 <SummerEmacs>	yea
Mar 10 21:40:08 <SummerEmacs>	i was playing it on the guitar
Mar 10 21:40:19 <SummerEmacs>	it's a fun easy song to play and i love it
Mar 10 21:41:52 <BiggerEatier>	Ooh, there was a time I used to strum things that vaguely resembled chords and chord progressions on the guitar... wasn't very good but hearing about it makes me want to try again some time
Mar 10 21:42:02 <SummerEmacs>	oh you should
Mar 10 21:42:03 <SummerEmacs>	it's so fun
Mar 10 21:42:06 <SummerEmacs>	i never stopped playing

Mar 10 21:43:02 <SummerEmacs>	i dunno i think maybe he crashed
Mar 10 21:43:20 <BiggerEatier>	Cool, mostly classic rock stuff, or what did you play?
Mar 10 21:43:37 <SummerEmacs>	we played stuff from the 60s through the 2000s indie rock stuff
Mar 10 21:43:59 <BiggerEatier>	My best friend throughout college was huge into guitar, listened to him play all the time
Mar 10 21:44:01 <SummerEmacs>	can't really play today's pop music on a guitar or drums or other instruments really 😀 
Mar 10 21:44:21 <BiggerEatier>	Also, he sat at the door and played Fuck her Gently by Jack Black as our other roommate lost his v-card, which was hilarious
Mar 10 21:44:22 <SummerEmacs>	i mean aside from some taylor swift songs ofc cuz she plays guitar
Mar 10 21:44:43 <SummerEmacs>	hehe
Mar 10 21:44:43 <BiggerEatier>	Needless to say he was drunk
Mar 10 21:45:42 <BiggerEatier>	Roommates girlfriend was none too happy lol
Mar 10 21:46:34 <SummerEmacs>	i'd probably go at him too
Mar 10 21:46:44 <BiggerEatier>	Lot of guitar heavy good stuff last few years though, I really like Gary Clark Jr and Chris Stapleton... play any of those?
Mar 10 21:48:32 <SummerEmacs>	test
Mar 10 21:48:35 <SummerEmacs>	oh there we go
Mar 10 21:48:38 <SummerEmacs>	oh there we go

Mar 10 21:48:51 <SummerEmacs>	sec
Mar 10 21:48:51 <BiggerEatier>	ag
Mar 10 21:48:57 <SummerEmacs>	i started editing your output for some reason not sure how
Mar 10 21:49:02 <SummerEmacs>	yea it was weird sokay tho
Mar 10 21:49:04 <SummerEmacs>	fixed it
Mar 10 21:58:50 <naokotani>	BigEatie: if  you want I could maybe think of a little routine for you
Mar 10 21:59:11 <naokotani>	probably some light warm ups and then a few poses. maybe 10 minutes 
Mar 10 22:00:46 <naokotani>	I could do it as a blog post actually. that might be kind of fun. Short yoga routine to help with computer strain
Mar 10 22:06:27 <SummerEmacs>	i already miss marvin
Mar 10 22:16:18 <BiggerEatier>	naokotani: That'd be great, thanks!
Mar 10 22:16:25 <BiggerEatier>	SummerEmacs: Sorry we're so boring for you!
Mar 10 22:17:12 <SummerEmacs>	lol you're not boring BiggerEatier
Mar 10 22:17:18 <SummerEmacs>	i just meant i miss his random little quips
Mar 10 22:17:38 <SummerEmacs>	kinda like a budding little AI running around and learning that i like to pat gently every now and then.
Mar 10 22:17:51 <BiggerEatier>	lol
Mar 10 22:17:57 <naokotani>	I eat cheese to 400 lines of debugging into arch linux btw
Mar 10 22:18:12 <naokotani>	SummerEmacs: I can be your MattByName 
Mar 10 22:18:21 <naokotani>	... Marvin2
Mar 10 22:18:24 <SummerEmacs>	lol
Mar 10 22:18:27 <SummerEmacs>	see he's totally down
Mar 10 22:18:31 <naokotani>	I can't @ him anymore since he's gone
Mar 10 22:18:34 <SummerEmacs>	i did that earlier too
Mar 10 22:18:35 <SummerEmacs>	yea
Mar 10 22:18:48 <naokotani>	its like a little hole in my big heart
Mar 10 22:19:01 <SummerEmacs>	BiggerEatier: see? i'm not the only one!
Mar 10 22:19:12 <SummerEmacs>	we've already all grown fond of the lil guy
Mar 10 22:19:29 <naokotani>	There has been time where it was 5am and I only had Marvin to keep me company through the long nights
Mar 10 22:19:56 <SummerEmacs>	i haven't had that
Mar 10 22:20:02 <SummerEmacs>	but i was mostly gone
Mar 10 22:20:11 <SummerEmacs>	speaking of which i'll be leaving again soon this coming week
Mar 10 22:20:49 <BiggerEatier>	Somewhere fun?
Mar 10 22:21:09 <SummerEmacs>	some places yea some places less so
Mar 10 22:21:32 <naokotani>	Ohio?
Mar 10 22:21:35 <SummerEmacs>	haha no
Mar 10 22:21:50 <SummerEmacs>	i have actually been to ohio tho!
Mar 10 22:22:04 <naokotani>	fascinating state
Mar 10 22:22:12 <naokotani>	lots of interesting native american history
Mar 10 22:22:22 <SummerEmacs>	yea it was interesting when i went
Mar 10 22:22:42 <naokotani>	Ever read any of Graham Hancocks books?
Mar 10 22:23:06 <SummerEmacs>	no i kinda refuse to waste my time on that tbh
Mar 10 22:23:30 <naokotani>	reading?
Mar 10 22:23:51 <BiggerEatier>	reading is for plebs
Mar 10 22:23:51 <SummerEmacs>	i kinda refuse to entertain his weird tripped out notions of "history" 😀 
Mar 10 22:24:19 <BiggerEatier>	Osmosis of information neo-from-the-matrix style is where it's at
Mar 10 22:24:38 <SummerEmacs>	i read a lot
Mar 10 22:24:42 <naokotani>	idk if they are that weird 
Mar 10 22:24:56 <SummerEmacs>	i read every night on my kindle for example
Mar 10 22:25:14 <naokotani>	Nice. I read every day too.
Mar 10 22:25:24 <BiggerEatier>	Osmosis all the way for me
Mar 10 22:25:57 <SummerEmacs>	i love my kindle. i literally take it everywhere i go. it's either in my bag or handbag or on my night table etc...
Mar 10 22:25:58 <naokotani>	anyway, His book on the America's was actually pretty good and not particualry tripped out
Mar 10 22:26:00 <SummerEmacs>	i'm always reading it
Mar 10 22:27:00 <naokotani>	Ohio reminded me of it because he did a chapter on the mississipi valley mound building cultures
Mar 10 22:27:19 <SummerEmacs>	yea i'm just not into that genre of revisionist stuff i'm sorry
Mar 10 22:27:34 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 10 22:28:49 <SummerEmacs>	i don't wanna get into an argument 15 mins before i go take a shower before bed. 🙃 
Mar 10 22:29:22 <naokotani>	Nothing to argue about. 
Mar 10 22:29:46 <naokotani>	I just get the impression I take my leisure reading less seriously
Mar 10 22:29:47 <SummerEmacs>	when it comes to hancock, there's a ton to argue about. 😛 
Mar 10 22:30:07 <BiggerEatier>	I suppose I should look this guy up...
Mar 10 22:30:16 <naokotani>	I guess if you really like arguing about nothing
Mar 10 22:30:46 <SummerEmacs>	well he's discreted by every major historian and archaeologist and sociologist out there so.... 😛 
Mar 10 22:30:53 <naokotani>	He writes popular about history and he comes up with all kinds of theories
Mar 10 22:31:08 <naokotani>	they range from basically common wisdow to very out there
Mar 10 22:31:13 <SummerEmacs>	more like tripped out "hypotheses" at best 😛 
Mar 10 22:31:16 <naokotani>	its just a fun read if you don't take it too seriously
Mar 10 22:31:35 <SummerEmacs>	yea i have a problem with people like that tho srsly
Mar 10 22:31:59 <SummerEmacs>	i didn't even go to uni yet i just know people who have and what they think about it and i follow some people who debunk tons of stuff and he's up on their list
Mar 10 22:32:15 <naokotani>	well I went to uni, and I studied antrhopology
Mar 10 22:32:36 <naokotani>	sometimes its fun to use your imagination 
Mar 10 22:32:46 <SummerEmacs>	well you'd be the first who i know of who did and who takes anything he says without a huge amount of salt 😀 
Mar 10 22:33:09 <naokotani>	I treat all popular literature on that stuff as entertainment
Mar 10 22:33:17 <SummerEmacs>	that's good actually
Mar 10 22:35:41 <SummerEmacs>	BiggerEatier: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Hancock
Mar 10 22:35:50 <BiggerEatier>	Yea, just reading about him
Mar 10 22:35:54 <SummerEmacs>	first paragraph: Graham Bruce Hancock (born 2 August 1950) is a British writer who promotes pseudoscientific[2][3] theories involving ancient civilizations and hypothetical lost lands.[4] Hancock speculates that an advanced ice age civilization was destroyed in a cataclysm, but that its survivors passed on their knowledge to hunter-gatherers, giving rise to the earliest known civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and 
Mar 10 22:35:54 <SummerEmacs>	Mesoamerica.[5][6]
Mar 10 22:36:23 <naokotani>	I don't see anything wrong with that
Mar 10 22:36:36 <BiggerEatier>	I could totally see that being a fun read
Mar 10 22:36:43 <naokotani>	It is lol
Mar 10 22:36:56 <naokotani>	he's good writer and comes up with all kinds of fun ideas
Mar 10 22:37:00 <BiggerEatier>	But understandable that it wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea
Mar 10 22:37:28 <naokotani>	Do I think you should put it on a reading list for first year arcaheology? probably not
Mar 10 22:38:46 <naokotani>	His book on the Americas is actually relatively reasonable
Mar 10 22:38:52 <BiggerEatier>	My personal opinion is undergrad should be spent coming to terms with mostly established areas of your field of study
Mar 10 22:39:01 <SummerEmacs>	yea but there's been sorta problems with some of his ideas in terms of promoting things that are very close to anti-semitic conspiracy theories.
Mar 10 22:39:12 <SummerEmacs>	which i have a major problem with
Mar 10 22:39:24 <SummerEmacs>	so it's all fun until it's not 😛 
Mar 10 22:39:35 <BiggerEatier>	Important to engage with dissent imo
Mar 10 22:39:45 <BiggerEatier>	Even dissent that is outrageous
Mar 10 22:39:45 <SummerEmacs>	we're talking about Icke level of delusion
Mar 10 22:39:53 <naokotani>	what lol
Mar 10 22:39:55 <SummerEmacs>	yea but it doesn't mean i want to waste my time reading him either.
Mar 10 22:40:16 <naokotani>	It seems like you have a very strong opinion for not having read his books
Mar 10 22:40:46 <SummerEmacs>	i didn't have to read mein kampf to know it was an antisemitic book either.
Mar 10 22:41:09 <SummerEmacs>	of course i did read it (just a few years ago) but i didn't have to in order to know what it was about.
Mar 10 22:41:36 <naokotani>	I think comparing him to hitler is maybe... a small stretch
Mar 10 22:42:05 <SummerEmacs>	i'm not comparing his actions to hitler, i'm comparing his conspiracy theories.
Mar 10 22:42:33 <BiggerEatier>	Every once in a while Summer comes raining fire lol
Mar 10 22:42:42 <SummerEmacs>	i didn't bring him up 😛 
Mar 10 22:44:02 <naokotani>	yeah I had read abou this before
Mar 10 22:44:41 <naokotani>	basically he thinks some poeple survived the ice age that had some more advanced science and people say that its sort of like white supremacy
Mar 10 22:44:43 <naokotani>	which is fair
Mar 10 22:45:18 <naokotani>	but like to say he's some kind of crazy racist is about as conspiracy level as anything he says
Mar 10 22:45:24 <naokotani>	which is ironic to say the least
Mar 10 22:45:42 <BiggerEatier>	OK, I will leave you guys to argue about Graham Hancock, gotta get back to work 
Mar 10 22:45:45 <BiggerEatier>	Adios folks
Mar 10 22:45:49 <naokotani>	later
Mar 10 22:46:24 <naokotani>	its like I said, arguing about nothing. its literally just entertainment light reading books not really meant to be academic
Mar 10 22:47:09 <SummerEmacs>	https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/01/02/close-encounters-racist-kind
Mar 10 22:47:25 <SummerEmacs>	it's long but worth it
Mar 10 22:47:39 <naokotani>	no, its not lol
Mar 10 22:48:26 <naokotani>	people take this stuff waayyy too seriously
Mar 10 22:49:10 <SummerEmacs>	i'd say they didn't take it seriously enough and we had the rise of Qanon because of it, and other crazy conspiracy theories linked to all of this stuff.
Mar 10 22:49:13 <SummerEmacs>	that's why i'm so against it
Mar 10 22:50:02 <naokotani>	I completely disagree that's why we have qanon
Mar 10 22:51:01 <naokotani>	Someone who has been reasonably educated can read books and not be ideologically tainted by them
Mar 10 22:51:11 <SummerEmacs>	well i'm not the only one to say it. a lot of people who track this stuff professionally have pointed out the roots of it being this sort of stuff.
Mar 10 22:52:06 <BiggerEatier>	When it comes to current events its probably best to take everything with a grain of salt, even coming from professionals
Mar 10 22:52:42 <naokotani>	people are going to come up with cooky stuff, if your socoiety is copllapsing its not because of that
Mar 10 22:53:15 <SummerEmacs>	i didn't say it's all of it, but it's definitely tied to it
Mar 10 22:54:38 <SummerEmacs>	but i'm gonna go take my shower now. night everyone. 🙃 👋

Mar 10 23:41:05 <naokotani>	I should actually get audio books of dune
Mar 11 00:11:56 <BiggerEatier>	I enjoyed the first Dune... not a big fan of this trend lately where a single story is broken into multiple movies, but other than that I thought it was good
Mar 11 00:17:35 <naokotani>	Had you read the books?

Mar 11 00:47:10 <sahil_>	shom: one cool trick that I use often in brave browser (chromium based browsers is --> map the ctrl key to the right alt, and then you can do ctrl (from the right thumb + t to create a new tab, ctrl+w to close the current tab.) Ctrl + 1 2 3 4.. to go to 1 2 3 4th tabs respectively
Mar 11 01:35:26 <shom>	sahil_: thanks for the suggestion, I use homerow mods. So my index finger is control if I press and hold (both hands), middle is shift, ring is alt, pinky is meta.
Mar 11 01:39:34 <shom>	benoitj: glad you saw it on IMAX, I think the visual spectacle is worth the IMAX... not sure I'll rewatch it but glad to have seen it the way the cinematography is intended. BiggerEatier, I recommend seeing it in IMAX in case it wasn't clear 😂

Mar 11 02:25:46 <naokotani>	my god im trying to tutor this guy in web development and he insists on using notepad 
Mar 11 02:26:16 <naokotani>	for the love of god and all that is holy cna we at least use notepad ++
Mar 11 02:27:52 <sahil_>	Still faster than vscode though :)
Mar 11 02:29:35 <naokotani>	going to have to hard disagree on that

Mar 11 02:46:31 <Fade>	auntie cow!
Mar 11 02:51:07 <BigEatie>	naokotani: First coding class I ever took was back in 1999 -- it was a summer Java class at a local college, the professor and the students all used notepad, and that was my preferred way of coding for several years until I discovered in notepad++ (or was it notepad2?) you could not only make horizontal selection but block selection
Mar 11 02:51:24 <BigEatie>	After that I was notepad++ for a long time
Mar 11 02:53:57 <BigEatie>	sahil_ never noticed any speed issues with vscode, seems snappy
Mar 11 03:00:57 <sahil_>	BigEatie: :) It was supposed to be a joke.
Mar 11 03:01:31 <sahil_>	But silly me, forgot that we are serious on editors here.

Mar 11 06:40:23 <sahil_>	I find myself in the place where the little that I know gets into my head. How do you people deal with it, if you feel like it.
Mar 11 06:42:07 <sahil_>	One way I found is to keep myself busy in doing harder and harder stuff, but then the moment people find about it, they start bloating my ego again.
Mar 11 06:43:24 <BigEatie>	I hang out here, and realize I know so very little
Mar 11 06:45:50 <sahil_>	BigEatie: That gave me another insight. It's all about identities. I better identify myself as one of the community members, and things will be a lot more comfortable, compared to thinking like a student etc.
Mar 11 07:25:19 <glenneth>	I concur with BigEatie :)
Mar 11 07:44:35 <cow_2001>	now i'm trying to redirect error into null.  there's %make-void-port won't do
Mar 11 07:44:41 <cow_2001>	but it won't do
Mar 11 07:44:58 <cow_2001>	makes my spawn throw a segmentation fault
Mar 11 07:45:13 <cow_2001>	(spawn "sh" (list "sh" "-c" "echo moo 1>&2") #:error (open-file "moo-error-file" "w")) works but (spawn "sh" (list "sh" "-c" "echo moo 1>&2") #:error (%make-void-port "wb")) does not and results with a segmentation fault
Mar 11 08:10:35 <sektor>	Bah. The cat is begging for food three horus early.
Mar 11 08:11:14 <glenneth>	hey sektor .  lol, I feel for you
Mar 11 08:23:29 <cow_2001>	confusion! will be my epitaph
Mar 11 08:52:27 <alternateved>	Good morning
Mar 11 08:53:38 <glenneth>	hey alternateved o/
Mar 11 08:56:25 <glenneth>	I got multiple workspaces per monitor figured out in hyprland.  Had to install hyprsome to get it done but it's working great
Mar 11 09:06:43 <daviwil>	morning folks
Mar 11 09:07:04 <cow_2001>	daviwil: Zelazny's Merlin saga is a page turner D:<
Mar 11 09:07:25 <cow_2001>	daviwil: look what i wrote! (you don't have to look) https://codeberg.org/kakafarm/guile-null-ptr/
Mar 11 09:08:17 <cow_2001>	i keep writing these simple scripts that do trivial stuff
Mar 11 09:08:23 <cow_2001>	i want to do something less trivial
Mar 11 09:09:50 <daviwil>	cow_2001: nice!  would be cool to provide a library from this, too, so that it can be integrated into apps.  also, you might be able to skip shelling out to curl by using the (web client) functions
Mar 11 09:09:57 <cow_2001>	oh!
Mar 11 09:10:23 <daviwil>	I'd also call it guile-0x0 because people recognize the name of the URL
Mar 11 09:10:50 <daviwil>	I didn't know what 'null-ptr' referred to until I went to the link
Mar 11 09:11:02 <cow_2001>	thought of that, but... guile has a problem with numbers
Mar 11 09:11:38 <cow_2001>	module / library names must not start with a number
Mar 11 09:11:55 <cow_2001>	it's a known bug
Mar 11 09:12:04 <daviwil>	understood, trying to think if there's another way around it
Mar 11 09:12:20 <cow_2001>	so, (guile-0x0 commands clipboard) and the like
Mar 11 09:12:26 <cow_2001>	?
Mar 11 09:12:28 <daviwil>	I think that's acceptable
Mar 11 09:12:30 <alternateved>	Simly O?
Mar 11 09:12:33 <cow_2001>	i see
Mar 11 09:12:45 <alternateved>	s/simly/simply
Mar 11 09:12:57 <daviwil>	the guile-json library uses just `json' as the first part of the module name, but in your case I think having the name be recognizable is more important
Mar 11 09:13:16 <daviwil>	but that's just one crafter's opinion
Mar 11 09:13:49 <cow_2001>	guile-0x0 or guile-0x0.st?
Mar 11 09:14:15 <daviwil>	i'd leave the .st out, even the emacs package is emacs-0x0
Mar 11 09:14:22 <cow_2001>	ah
Mar 11 09:14:34 <daviwil>	in fact, it's just 0x0 once installed
Mar 11 09:20:48 <cow_2001>	thank you
Mar 11 09:22:20 <daviwil>	no worries!  it's a useful library to have around
Mar 11 09:22:40 <daviwil>	one thing I'd love for this community to do is flesh out the Guile ecosystem with useful stuff like this
Mar 11 09:27:34 <trev>	i really want to love guile but every time i try hacking on something with it i end up spending so much time ironing out the tooling and libraries 
Mar 11 09:27:57 <daviwil>	Which parts give you the most grief?
Mar 11 09:27:59 <trev>	i guess that may just be some beginning pains
Mar 11 09:28:18 <daviwil>	I saw you were trying to experiment with crafter-bot, nice :)
Mar 11 09:30:09 <trev>	well, i was challenging myself to not use emacs for it, so that means no geiser. I'm using neovim with a plugin called conjure, to eval sexps to the repl. I got through all the hump of installing libraries manually. It wasn't hard for me, but i could see it not being easy for a newbie, compared to something like Chicken eggs
Mar 11 09:30:18 <trev>	the worst part is always the REPL experience 
Mar 11 09:30:49 <trev>	i need to spend more time with it and create a good workflow on starting and connecting to a repl
Mar 11 09:30:53 <glenneth>	hey trev o/
Mar 11 09:31:13 <glenneth>	daviwil: o/
Mar 11 09:31:26 <trev>	hey glenneth, happy monday
Mar 11 09:31:28 <daviwil>	trev: guile-ares-rs provides an nREPL server for Guile which you might be able to use more easily from neovim: https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/guile-ares-rs/
Mar 11 09:31:31 <daviwil>	hey glenneth
Mar 11 09:32:01 <daviwil>	The Guile experience is definitely weak when not using Guix and Emacs, though, that's for sure
Mar 11 09:32:17 <trev>	daviwil: yeah there is an open issue for having that implemented into Conjure. You should take a look at that plugin if you haven't seen it. It's impressive 
Mar 11 09:32:28 <daviwil>	I have heard about it, yeah
Mar 11 09:32:40 <cow_2001>	renamed!
Mar 11 09:32:51 <daviwil>	cow_2001: 🚀
Mar 11 09:33:15 <daviwil>	I think it would be good to spend some effort trying to make Guile easier for anyone to use
Mar 11 09:33:18 <cow_2001>	now need to convert it into a library
Mar 11 09:33:28 <trev>	am i wrong to think that guile won't really have a place at the table unless the tooling is decent across all environments, even the forsaken VSC*de?
Mar 11 09:33:42 <daviwil>	I think that depends on what the goal is
Mar 11 09:34:03 <daviwil>	I don't really see Guile as a language for the average VS Code user, but definitely the tooling should be equally good across "hacker" editors
Mar 11 09:34:27 <daviwil>	I don't mean that as a diss on VS Code users, more that the people who use VS Code are typically writing a different kind of app
Mar 11 09:34:39 <daviwil>	I don't expect people to be writing Guile at big companies
Mar 11 09:34:55 <daviwil>	But small teams, either proprietary or Free Software projects, that is feasible
Mar 11 09:35:16 <daviwil>	guile-ares-rs is definitely an attempt to make Guile more usable across all editors that have nREPL support
Mar 11 09:35:16 <trev>	i see. that makes sense
Mar 11 09:36:56 <cow_2001>	if you build it, a few will come, maybe.  when a few, maybe, will come, build it slightly bigger.  when you build it slightly bigger, a few more will come, feasibly.
Mar 11 09:37:10 <trev>	yeah i spent some time looking into nREPL and it appears to be simple for the area-rs use case, but i don't know fennel well enough to hack it into conjure
Mar 11 09:37:22 <trev>	perpetually getting blocked by something :D 
Mar 11 09:37:36 <daviwil>	yeah, not enough hours in the day for that
Mar 11 09:37:57 <daviwil>	but maybe if I can stoke enough interest, more people helping out will make some progress
Mar 11 09:39:02 <trev>	yeah, another thing i thought about when looking at that IRC library which appears quite dead, is that you only need a small group of devs (like this community?) to revitalize an ecosystem to the point of comfortable usability 
Mar 11 09:39:12 <daviwil>	yep
Mar 11 09:39:32 <glenneth>	wiating on the intermediate scheme course daviwil :)  may have more confidence to contribute
Mar 11 09:39:52 <daviwil>	ekaitz mentioned on the Flux stream that there is a newer fork of it redesigned to use the 8sync actor model library
Mar 11 09:40:26 <daviwil>	https://gitlab.com/janneke/snuik
Mar 11 09:40:31 <daviwil>	That may be a full project instead of a library, though
Mar 11 09:41:54 <daviwil>	I think it could be more interesting to rewrite guile-irc using Fibers instead
Mar 11 09:42:07 <trev>	i also keep trying to avoid guix, but now i think it needs to be the npm/cargo/pip of guile
Mar 11 09:42:20 <daviwil>	glenneth: Yeah, I want to get that going!  I felt like I needed to actually write the proposed projects myself before bringing people on board, but maybe I'm being a perfectionist :)
Mar 11 09:42:37 <daviwil>	trev: It basically is, but the problem is that it isn't fully cross-platform
Mar 11 09:42:48 <daviwil>	Making Guix work on Windows is probably a no-go
Mar 11 09:43:06 <daviwil>	I suppose it's *somewhat* possible in MSYS2 but I have no idea how much effort that would take
Mar 11 09:43:19 <daviwil>	actually, not just MSYS2 but MINGW64
Mar 11 09:43:53 <daviwil>	I'd actually consider writing a more focused dependency manager for cross-platform projects which just pulls Git repos and assembles a load path
Mar 11 09:44:14 <daviwil>	it'd have to deal with native module builds, though, which adds complexity
Mar 11 09:44:24 <daviwil>	but Guix would be ideal
Mar 11 09:44:47 <daviwil>	I wish I had double the amount of time so I could spend as much time hacking on projects as creating content :)
Mar 11 09:45:14 <daviwil>	but maybe my time is better spent getting more people motivated to work on common goals
Mar 11 09:48:08 <glenneth>	and there's the rub daviwil the content you create definitely motivates people
Mar 11 09:49:21 <daviwil>	I just need to find the right balance of promotion and effort organizing
Mar 11 09:49:26 <trev>	when i think of guile i think of FOSS instead of windows LOL
Mar 11 09:49:34 <daviwil>	definitely
Mar 11 09:50:02 <daviwil>	Windows is not the highest importance, but you handicap its usefulness for developing apps and games if Windows isn't supported
Mar 11 09:53:25 <trev>	i could see how you could start a project and rally the community to work on it
Mar 11 09:54:22 <daviwil>	it's doable, I just need to come up with a clear direction and kick off some of the work myself
Mar 11 09:54:33 <trev>	writing some systemcraft-y programs
Mar 11 09:56:30 <trev>	glenneth can write a discourse api client in guile and we can have a few different client frontends
Mar 11 09:57:21 <trev>	i'm just dreamin here, in reality we all have lives and no time for having fun on the computer like we're 22 without any cares :']
Mar 11 09:57:39 <daviwil>	the problem with projects like that is that I really struggle to decide whether they should be purely in Emacs or if Guile plays a role somehow
Mar 11 09:57:56 <daviwil>	this weekend I was thinking about a Guile library that drives Sway, but then I wondered if that should actually be written in Emacs Lisp instead
Mar 11 09:58:03 <trev>	lol
Mar 11 09:58:21 <daviwil>	the only real solution is to rewrite Emacs in Guile ;)
Mar 11 09:58:30 <trev>	✅ Emacs parasite in the brain
Mar 11 09:58:59 <daviwil>	Emacs is really useful as a programmable environment
Mar 11 09:59:05 <trev>	i made spaghetti the other day and was thinking to myself "should this just be in emacs?"
Mar 11 09:59:20 <daviwil>	I think we've all experienced that at some point
Mar 11 09:59:25 <glenneth>	lol
Mar 11 09:59:42 <trev>	glenneth tried to feed his cat using emacs!!
Mar 11 09:59:58 <daviwil>	it isn't inconceivable
Mar 11 10:00:00 <trev>	made a command and a rube goldberg machine to dispense the food
Mar 11 10:00:44 <daviwil>	"From Org tables to your cat's table, insert-kibble has you covered"
Mar 11 10:01:03 <glenneth>	i've thought about it :)
Mar 11 10:01:11 <trev>	just don't get it confused with insert-ratpoison
Mar 11 10:01:20 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 11 10:01:54 <glenneth>	 i'm still stuck with stash.scm
Mar 11 10:02:01 <trev>	daviwil: emacs is unmatched for scheme/lisp it seems. so much so that i feel like it gatekeeps a bit
Mar 11 10:03:28 <daviwil>	there's really no reason why that should be the case, but I suppose that once someone gets indoctrinated into Lisp they seek out Lisp-focused tools
Mar 11 10:03:49 <daviwil>	on the other hand, what comes first, the Lisp interest or the Emacs interest?
Mar 11 10:03:54 <trev>	that's probably it
Mar 11 10:04:52 <trev>	for me lisp i guess since the interest stems from functional programming
Mar 11 10:05:33 <daviwil>	yeah, that's sort of how it happened for me
Mar 11 10:06:04 <glenneth>	emacs for me.  I had no real interest in programming at all 
Mar 11 10:06:04 <daviwil>	I was getting paid in grad school to write Common Lisp but didn't really see the value of it yet until I started learning about macros, then I started looking for a better programming environment than vim, which lead me to "Lisp in a Box" which was based on Emacs
Mar 11 10:07:23 <glenneth>	and then.  A few systemcrafters and Flux videos later....
Mar 11 10:07:33 <glenneth>	:D
Mar 11 10:07:54 <daviwil>	the cult indoctrination is working!!
Mar 11 10:09:07 <glenneth>	TBH daviwil your Flux streams for the game jam.  could just see you were having fun with it. 
Mar 11 10:09:30 <daviwil>	that's really cool!  I should do more of those
Mar 11 10:09:48 <daviwil>	I think the next Ludum Dare is coming up soon
Mar 11 10:09:59 <daviwil>	April 12
Mar 11 10:11:27 <glenneth>	Honestly.  And listening to yuou explain what you were doing and hoping to achieve, lifted the veil.  Even though I had no idea what a car or a cdr were
Mar 11 10:12:02 <glenneth>	but now i do :)
Mar 11 10:14:56 <trev>	re: stash.scm -- that is a great project idea too glenneth 
Mar 11 10:15:07 <trev>	i think it could really rally some people in this community
Mar 11 10:16:07 <glenneth>	roll it up as a library to be incorporated into other programs
Mar 11 10:21:25 <cow_2001>	okay, don't know how to (web ...) ~_~
Mar 11 10:22:16 <glenneth>	this so far  https://0x0.st/Hhp8.txt
Mar 11 10:22:38 <cow_2001>	how do you curl -F using guile's (web ...)?
Mar 11 10:23:41 <daviwil>	glenneth: nice and clean!
Mar 11 10:24:44 <glenneth>	changed a bit from previous efforts but still getting errors.  learning though :)
Mar 11 10:24:57 <glenneth>	thanks daviwil 
Mar 11 10:25:42 <daviwil>	cow_2001: you'd need to use http-request with #:method 'POST and #:headers '(("Content-Type" . "multipart/form-data")), then the body would need to be encoded the right way for formdata, so in other words you kinda have to construct that manually
Mar 11 10:26:02 <cow_2001>	hmm
Mar 11 10:26:13 <cow_2001>	need to read about multipart/form-data
Mar 11 10:44:57 <trev>	cow_2001: you didn't come up with a recursive name like g-golf?
Mar 11 10:47:34 <cow_2001>	:<
Mar 11 10:47:47 <trev>	g-paste : guile pasta-a-snippet-to-external...
Mar 11 10:48:07 <daviwil>	I think the g-* naming convention is uncommon
Mar 11 10:48:26 <naokotani>	I think some logitech stuff uses that
Mar 11 10:48:29 <naokotani>	g this g that
Mar 11 10:48:38 <daviwil>	g-unit
Mar 11 10:48:38 <trev>	it's also confusing
Mar 11 10:48:47 <trev>	i thought g-golf was a code golf thing
Mar 11 10:49:06 <naokotani>	im not going to lie, system crafters is something a g unit in its own right
Mar 11 10:49:54 <daviwil>	a hip hop entourage?
Mar 11 10:50:43 <naokotani>	As in a unit of Gs, gangsters, OGs even in some cases
Mar 11 10:51:15 <daviwil>	I'll take it
Mar 11 10:51:39 <naokotani>	im thinking something along the lines of that scene in office space where the smash the printer
Mar 11 10:51:46 <trev>	g-unit isn't a guile unit testing framework?
Mar 11 10:51:53 <daviwil>	not yet
Mar 11 10:52:07 <naokotani>	you might be bething j unit
Mar 11 10:52:12 <naokotani>	that's the java testing framework
Mar 11 10:52:20 <trev>	yeah 
Mar 11 10:52:27 <daviwil>	it has to play the intro loop for In Da Club while it's running your tests
Mar 11 10:52:59 <naokotani>	I have my guile tests cofigured to run hypnotize by notorius BIG when I run tests
Mar 11 10:54:16 <naokotani>	In other news. I am having a hell of a time getting mulli monitors to not be on crack on wayland
Mar 11 10:54:29 <trev>	do you have to throw singles at the computer to get it to do the tests?
Mar 11 10:54:56 <naokotani>	trev: No usually I rap battle my guile into doing things
Mar 11 10:55:14 <naokotani>	I have something like marvin set up and I rap battle it
Mar 11 10:56:09 <naokotani>	I tried to follow th hyprland section on multi monitors and it did.... odd things. I tired way displays and it works... sort of
Mar 11 10:56:25 <naokotani>	way dispalys seems to have a bit of a mind of its own. 
Mar 11 10:56:41 <trev>	glenn got it to work with hyprsome he said
Mar 11 10:56:47 <trev>	whatever that is
Mar 11 10:58:18 <naokotani>	I think the issue is I need to figure out the hyprland config itself
Mar 11 10:58:23 <naokotani>	but its somewhat.... vague int he docs
Mar 11 10:58:36 <naokotani>	It hink it assumes you have outside knowledge about wayland, which is fair
Mar 11 10:59:35 <naokotani>	This is alpha software and my first program in Rust, bugs are bound to happen but nothing that will break your system.
Mar 11 10:59:37 <naokotani>	Some features are most likely missing.
Mar 11 10:59:54 <naokotani>	I might pass on hyprsome for now
Mar 11 11:00:43 <naokotani>	ti could be part of my issue is that im using a laptop monitor and a real monitor and thats causing some weirdness
Mar 11 11:02:54 <trev>	people say hyprland is mostly stable now i thought
Mar 11 11:05:35 <cow_2001>	there's prior art from cwebber
Mar 11 11:05:40 <cow_2001>	https://notabug.org/cwebber/guile-webutils/src/master/webutils/multipart.scm
Mar 11 11:06:14 <naokotani>	that's hyprsome
Mar 11 11:06:27 <naokotani>	its not acutally made by the same people. its a hobby project
Mar 11 11:06:34 <cow_2001>	i really need to get in bed and go to sleep
Mar 11 11:06:44 <naokotani>	maybe it works perfectly, but that doesn't really inspire confidence
Mar 11 11:06:59 <cow_2001>	good night!
Mar 11 11:07:04 <daviwil>	cow_2001: nice!  I was looking for that but couldn't remember where it was
Mar 11 11:07:19 <cow_2001>	how about guile-gurl?
Mar 11 11:07:26 <cow_2001>	how big is curl?
Mar 11 11:08:04 <cow_2001>	my brain doesn't even have a sense of scale for such a thing
Mar 11 11:08:12 <daviwil>	having a simplified HTTP client wrapper would be nice, but it doesn't need to go as far as curl
Mar 11 11:08:47 <cow_2001>	someone once told me that things are complex because details matter
Mar 11 11:09:38 <daviwil>	the important part is deciding which details matter
Mar 11 11:09:41 <cow_2001>	it sounds a bit of a self evident truth, but if you simplify stuff enough you might get unexpected bad behaviour
Mar 11 11:09:57 <cow_2001>	hmm
Mar 11 11:10:01 <daviwil>	you might, but I think it's better to solve specific problems and then expand and iterate over time
Mar 11 11:10:19 <cow_2001>	"think small"
Mar 11 11:10:35 <cow_2001>	or rather, think concretely
Mar 11 11:10:39 <daviwil>	exactly
Mar 11 11:10:55 <cow_2001>	okay, i really need to go to sleep.  real good night now!
Mar 11 11:11:01 <daviwil>	seeya!

Mar 11 11:19:23 <naokotani>	ok. it sems to be working. but now I can't get it to be on the right
Mar 11 11:32:36 <glenneth>	naokotani: https://github.com/sopa0/hyprsome
Mar 11 11:33:15 <naokotani>	yeah I looked at that. My issue is now it absoutely insists that my laptop is on the left
Mar 11 11:33:49 <glenneth>	https://0x0.st/Hhpl.txt
Mar 11 11:34:16 <glenneth>	have to give them coordinates
Mar 11 11:34:45 <naokotani>	yeah I am. and its not working. its very odd
Mar 11 11:35:02 <glenneth>	https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors/
Mar 11 11:35:17 <glenneth>	ahh.  Sorry
Mar 11 11:36:11 <glenneth>	hyprctl monitors from the cli
Mar 11 11:37:31 <glenneth>	my laptop display was always eDP-1.  hyprland shows it as eDP-2.  changed it in my config and all is good
Mar 11 11:38:16 <naokotani>	yeah everything is fine, resoultion is fine, but for ive tried every comobo of those shifting values I can think of and its not shifting
Mar 11 11:38:43 <naokotani>	workspaces work. 
Mar 11 11:39:04 <glenneth>	cool.
Mar 11 11:39:40 <trev>	cow_2001: how about "an idiot admires complexity, but a genius admires simplicity" 
Mar 11 11:39:52 <glenneth>	you set HDMI at 0x0?
Mar 11 11:40:38 <glenneth>	asuming it's HDMI out
Mar 11 11:41:43 <naokotani>	its umm
Mar 11 11:41:47 <naokotani>	display port
Mar 11 11:45:53 <glenneth>	post your monitors section?
Mar 11 11:47:24 <glenneth>	https://git.sr.ht/~glenneth/dotfiles/tree/master/item/hyprland/hyprland.conf
Mar 11 11:47:31 <naokotani>	hold on im going to restart
Mar 11 11:47:36 <naokotani>	because something jsut isn't making sense
Mar 11 11:47:49 <naokotani>	doens't matter what I do witht eh poistions it doesnt' change
Mar 11 11:47:57 <glenneth>	ok 
Mar 11 11:48:00 <naokotani>	but I had run way-displays so maybe it bugged something out
Mar 11 11:48:47 <naokotani>	becuase it really just feels like its ignoring the values entirely
Mar 11 11:55:23 <naokotani>	yeah that worked
Mar 11 11:55:28 <naokotani>	soemthing was just bugged out
Mar 11 11:55:36 <glenneth>	awesome :)
Mar 11 11:55:39 <naokotani>	was changing values for like 30 minutes and nothing was working
Mar 11 11:55:42 <naokotani>	was going nuts lol
Mar 11 11:55:57 <glenneth>	crafting lol
Mar 11 11:56:32 <glenneth>	I'm pretty sold on hyprland
Mar 11 11:56:52 <naokotani>	yeah I really like it overall
Mar 11 11:57:12 <glenneth>	installed hyprpaper to handle wallpapers too 
Mar 11 11:57:30 <naokotani>	yeah i used wpaperdd
Mar 11 11:57:45 <naokotani>	I didn't realize hyprpapr was a thing, I might switch at some point
Mar 11 11:57:57 <naokotani>	but wpaperd seems to do exactly what I need so Idk
Mar 11 11:59:13 <glenneth>	was just on a list of recommended utils.  First one I tried, it worked just fine
Mar 11 11:59:38 <naokotani>	yeah I used hypridle
Mar 11 11:59:51 <naokotani>	seems to work. hyprlock I wasn't so in to
Mar 11 12:00:57 <glenneth>	not that concerned about that just yet lol
Mar 11 12:01:16 <naokotani>	yeah its not a big deal
Mar 11 12:01:21 <glenneth>	,y laptop doesn't go too far 
Mar 11 12:01:42 <glenneth>	*my 
Mar 11 12:02:14 <naokotani>	same,b ut I have a 5 year old
Mar 11 12:03:40 <glenneth>	lol.  I don't have those issues :)
Mar 11 12:11:56 <naokotani>	trying to get it set up for streaming today
Mar 11 12:12:13 <naokotani>	I had a tutoring session last night and it was um... rough
Mar 11 12:12:30 <naokotani>	might try to just get OBS set up so I can just stream that
Mar 11 12:24:02 <glenneth>	you stream too? 
Mar 11 12:26:43 <naokotani>	No
Mar 11 12:26:46 <naokotani>	might be fun
Mar 11 12:26:56 <naokotani>	I've thought about maybe just doing a like casual come code with me
Mar 11 12:27:20 <naokotani>	similar to what system crafters is, but bad because daviwil is liek 500 times more knowledgable than me lol
Mar 11 12:27:47 <daviwil>	I have a team of producers feeding information into my headphones at all times
Mar 11 12:28:53 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 11 12:29:22 <naokotani>	well you have just been doing this stuff way longer. I am happy to know what I don't know
Mar 11 12:30:43 <naokotani>	but yeah I would just do rust and javascript web stuff and if people want to watch that's great
Mar 11 12:38:52 <trev>	daviwil: isn't the whole thing just a bit and you just use an ipad and apple watch in your day to day life?
Mar 11 12:39:36 <daviwil>	yes, my whole activity is funded by a shadowy FOSS conglomerate
Mar 11 12:44:43 <naokotani>	well you never know. Didn't Richard Stallman go to Epstein's island or osmething
Mar 11 12:46:37 <daviwil>	stallman didn't get the invite because he doesn't use WhatsApp
Mar 11 12:46:53 <naokotani>	by whatsapp I assume you mean weechat?
Mar 11 12:47:24 <daviwil>	no, I mean WhatsApp, as it is not FOSS
Mar 11 12:47:46 <naokotani>	That it ain't
Mar 11 12:49:17 <naokotani>	oh, you weren't around before I asked. Do you have any advice on mics? I am looking at just getting a blue yeti and an arm thing, but It hought you might have some insight
Mar 11 12:50:03 <naokotani>	Ideally looking for osmething sub 200 canadian
Mar 11 12:51:03 <trev>	naokotani: https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/mv7?variant=MV7-K
Mar 11 12:51:07 <trev>	the podcaster mic
Mar 11 12:51:44 <naokotani>	ain't working
Mar 11 12:51:50 <naokotani>	its the mv7k?
Mar 11 12:51:55 <trev>	yeah
Mar 11 12:52:28 <trev>	gotta make sure everyone knows you have a podcast
Mar 11 12:52:39 <naokotani>	yeah this is 249 USD
Mar 11 12:52:43 <naokotani>	which about double my budget
Mar 11 12:53:15 <alternateved>	Shure has great mics
Mar 11 12:54:13 <naokotani>	I don't have any right wing think tank seed money
Mar 11 12:54:22 <naokotani>	Im just trying to get set up for teaching online
Mar 11 12:55:22 <daviwil>	I'll be getting a Shure for my next one, but right now I use an AudioTechnica AT2035 condenser mic with a Focusrite Saffire 2i2 audio interface
Mar 11 12:56:51 <daviwil>	I paid 145 USD for that one a long time ago
Mar 11 12:57:23 <naokotani>	yeah that seems to about what it is now
Mar 11 13:00:49 <naokotani>	hhmm, maybe I'm realistically under budget
Mar 11 13:04:01 <naokotani>	I also wonder if a dynamic mic would be better for not picking up keyboards
Mar 11 13:10:39 <trev>	i think you can get directional condensers but probably just need a noise gate or something
Mar 11 13:10:54 <daviwil>	noise gate is key
Mar 11 13:11:05 <naokotani>	noise gate is software?
Mar 11 13:11:14 <daviwil>	yeah its a filter in OBS
Mar 11 13:11:27 <naokotani>	oh ok. yeah im reading the arch wiki on obs atm
Mar 11 13:12:32 <trev>	you don't want it to pick up on any flatulence from your doritos and beans diet
Mar 11 13:12:46 <naokotani>	trev: I mostly eat potatoes
Mar 11 13:12:57 <trev>	with ranch
Mar 11 13:13:04 <trev>	oh no we're back to this again
Mar 11 13:13:26 <naokotani>	What I am thinking is going with a USB and then if I decide to get real serious down the line get a studio mic and an interface
Mar 11 13:13:38 <naokotani>	https://www.sennheiser.com/en-us/catalog/products/microphones/profile-usb-microphone/profile-usb-microphone-700065
Mar 11 13:14:05 <naokotani>	ive had seinheisser headphones for years and they are bomb proof
Mar 11 13:18:26 <barocio>	Morning, Crafters!
Mar 11 13:18:31 <daviwil>	hey barocio
Mar 11 13:18:33 <naokotani>	barocio: morning
Mar 11 13:20:25 <trev>	mornin
Mar 11 13:20:48 <trev>	i think most usb mics sound like crap and definitely don't like the blue yeti
Mar 11 13:20:54 <trev>	just my two cents though 
Mar 11 13:20:58 <barocio>	Here, struggling with my site 😅, and also with my guix (system and home) configuration 😭.
Mar 11 13:21:23 <naokotani>	150 dollar mics sound worse than 300 dollar mics
Mar 11 13:21:27 <naokotani>	no way around that
Mar 11 13:22:51 <trev>	yep
Mar 11 13:23:11 <naokotani>	but a 300 dollar mic is acutally a 500 dollar mic
Mar 11 13:23:15 <naokotani>	because you need an interface
Mar 11 13:24:13 <trev>	i think a headset mic sounds better than some of those low end condensers though
Mar 11 13:24:23 <naokotani>	true
Mar 11 13:24:25 <naokotani>	I have this
Mar 11 13:24:32 <trev>	depending on the headset, which is also expensive 
Mar 11 13:26:17 <naokotani>	https://www.amazon.ca/Antlion-Audio-Attachable-Noise-Cancelling-Playstation/dp/B07YN25KWN?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=ABA3VCXRI2AFN
Mar 11 13:26:34 <naokotani>	taht or something very similar
Mar 11 13:27:43 <naokotani>	so. maybe usb condersor mics are a scam to get kids that want to be youtubers to spend a bunch of money on what is in reality not much better than a 50 dollar desktop mic?
Mar 11 13:28:10 <naokotani>	I also have a low budget interface
Mar 11 13:29:26 <naokotani>	https://ca.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/sound-blasterx-g6
Mar 11 13:29:29 <naokotani>	something like that
Mar 11 13:29:37 <naokotani>	so really id probably be downgrading
Mar 11 13:30:23 <trev>	i had a focusrite like david that i got from massdrop many years ago
Mar 11 13:31:24 <naokotani>	what I should do is try some recording with what I have and see how it is
Mar 11 13:31:38 <trev>	the dac amp won't help i think
Mar 11 13:32:38 <naokotani>	oh its just for audio out?
Mar 11 13:32:52 <trev>	yeah
Mar 11 13:32:53 <naokotani>	I had to get it because plugging straight into my desktop was causing all kinds of background noise
Mar 11 13:33:36 <trev>	maybe you can find some used gear from a struggling musician 
Mar 11 13:34:04 <naokotani>	it says it has a "Discrete Headphone Bi-amp:
Mar 11 13:34:21 <naokotani>	what I should do is record something and play it back and see where I really stand
Mar 11 13:35:15 <naokotani>	of coures, this still leaves the matter of what to do with my birthday money
Mar 11 13:37:57 <glenneth>	anyone familiar with the 'get-opt-long' function of the 'ice-9' module for guile scheme?
Mar 11 13:42:54 <trev>	naokotani: save it till next birthday and compound your spending power? lol
Mar 11 13:45:27 <naokotani>	after all
Mar 11 13:45:31 <naokotani>	kripparian uses a headset
Mar 11 13:45:42 <naokotani>	and he's a real OG streamer
Mar 11 13:47:33 <gopar>	morning beautiful ppl. haven't been in here in a sec
Mar 11 13:48:23 <daviwil>	hey gopar
Mar 11 13:48:41 <gopar>	hey, did you give your talk already? How'd that go?
Mar 11 13:48:49 <daviwil>	conference is in May
Mar 11 13:49:07 <gopar>	oops, I totally knew that
Mar 11 13:51:43 <daviwil>	no worries!
Mar 11 13:59:13 <glenneth>	gopar: o/
Mar 11 14:02:07 <talos>	Good day Crafters
Mar 11 14:04:44 *	gopar waves intensely at glenneth  
Mar 11 14:04:59 <glenneth>	hey talos 
Mar 11 14:07:37 <daviwil>	https://github.com/altsem/gitu
Mar 11 14:08:31 <daviwil>	looks pretty nice
Mar 11 14:09:53 <gopar>	pretty slick. Already has a good amount of stars
Mar 11 14:11:09 <talos>	Heyo glenneth
Mar 11 14:14:43 <glenneth>	do i just dive in to the #guile and #scheme irc channels and start asking questions?
Mar 11 14:15:12 <daviwil>	glenneth: I'd start with Guile, but what did you want to ask about `get-opt-long`?
Mar 11 14:15:17 <daviwil>	#guile, I mean
Mar 11 14:17:22 <talos>	Start with Guile if you like charge characters, otherwise pick almost any other character 
Mar 11 14:17:36 <talos>	His Sonic Boom is undefeatable!
Mar 11 14:17:37 <glenneth>	i got guile-stash.scm to work but i had to hardcode the paths in to the .scm file.  trying to utilise the 'get-opt-long' function for command line input is throwing "match" errors
Mar 11 14:17:56 <trev>	is it this one?: https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/getopt_002dlong.html
Mar 11 14:18:31 <daviwil>	glenneth: My guess is that the option syntax might be slightly off, can you paste it?
Mar 11 14:18:49 <glenneth>	trev: yes.  That;s what I've been reading
Mar 11 14:20:15 <glenneth>	https://0x0.st/HhOh.txt commented out the 'get-opt'long' section to test the rest of the script
Mar 11 14:21:58 <glenneth>	and the backtrace error https://0x0.st/HhOC.txt
Mar 11 14:25:56 <glenneth>	i have yet to add directory traversal, error handling, command-line argume3nts, path-handling and user permissions :D
Mar 11 14:27:28 <daviwil>	glenneth: https://0x0.st/HhVX.txt
Mar 11 14:28:06 <daviwil>	the format of each arg item is `(arg-name (option-name option-val))`  where the list of option names and expected values are described below the function in the manual
Mar 11 14:28:15 <daviwil>	they really need to include an example there so that its more clear
Mar 11 14:28:51 <daviwil>	The result of running that sample is `((()) (package-dir . "bar") (target . "foo"))`
Mar 11 14:30:13 <glenneth>	Thanks daviwil I'll try that :)
Mar 11 14:35:12 <zororg>	Hi all! Actually I was reading newsletter 07, and felt that even I was thinking over zettelkasten and plain org mode notes extensively.
Mar 11 14:35:29 <zororg>	Was reading over many blogs and posts on reddit.
Mar 11 14:37:01 <zororg>	Kinda I came to conclusion that leveraging the plain org mode would be good. Many pointed out to use tags and headlines very much with notes. And after using packages like `consult` `org-ql`, I can feel that there is no need for zettel system for org mode users.
Mar 11 14:37:31 <zororg>	Definitely this will be a good idea for a stream sometime!
Mar 11 15:36:42 <glenneth>	how do you guys keep track of changes in your code while working on it? 
Mar 11 15:37:21 <benoitj>	I do multiple commit while I work on code, most of these commits get squashed
Mar 11 15:37:36 <alternateved>	I mostly track changes by git diffs
Mar 11 15:38:05 <trev>	glenneth: git d
Mar 11 15:38:07 <trev>	iff
Mar 11 15:39:05 <benoitj>	there is also a key element to this, slicing your work in small "working" elements (compiles, tests are passing, etc)
Mar 11 15:39:17 <glenneth>	so you run git for every change?
Mar 11 15:39:28 <benoitj>	no
Mar 11 15:39:38 <benoitj>	not every change is worth tracking
Mar 11 15:39:43 <benoitj>	hmm,
Mar 11 15:39:47 <benoitj>	what is change for you :P
Mar 11 15:39:50 <glenneth>	I've just made ten changes in five minutes lol
Mar 11 15:40:03 <benoitj>	I dont track at that level
Mar 11 15:40:19 <trev>	you could look into something like undo-tree
Mar 11 15:40:22 <glenneth>	that's what i mean benoitj 
Mar 11 15:40:26 <trev>	forgot what it's called on emacs
Mar 11 15:40:52 <benoitj>	I track small units of a feature, not every single keyboard input
Mar 11 15:42:01 <benoitj>	yeah, undo is maybe the right tool, but at that level, you dont really need to, it's stuff you coded 3 minutes ago, I hope you remember :P. I do make special commits if I know i'm going to change many things, right before making all these destructive changes
Mar 11 15:44:16 <glenneth>	the script I am woking on works, but only when the paths are hard coded.  daviwil helped me out, i commented out my working section, and incorporated those changes.  I'm still getting errors but different ones.  Think it has more to do with my command line arguments now
Mar 11 15:44:34 <daviwil>	glenneth: What I do is commit the current state of my code when I'm happy with it, then I run `git diff` after making changes to check out what I've done since the last commit
Mar 11 15:44:51 <daviwil>	I do that with `magit-status` to make things easier to navigate inside of Emacs
Mar 11 15:46:09 <glenneth>	ok.  maybe i need to slow my roll :)  just trying to figure out a good workflow.  Y'know...now I'm a developer :D
Mar 11 15:46:10 <trev>	also having diff-hl makes for a nice way to navigate through hunks of changes in a file
Mar 11 15:46:23 <glenneth>	totally kidding btw
Mar 11 15:47:04 <trev>	if you're developing something then you're a developer
Mar 11 15:47:19 <glenneth>	I'm taking where it is right now as a win lol
Mar 11 15:47:31 <benoitj>	glenn
Mar 11 15:47:42 <benoitj>	glenneth: if you use emacs, you're already a developer ;)
Mar 11 15:48:11 <glenneth>	haha  I'll take that benoitj :)
Mar 11 15:49:08 <benoitj>	in practice, what you asked is quite similar to: do you take notes of every single toughts that you think of for more than 10 seconds. no :P
Mar 11 15:50:04 <benoitj>	I think it's somewhat related to the perception that developers write a lot of code in a day. nope.
Mar 11 15:50:11 <glenneth>	the script isn't correctly parsing the --target option even though it's clearly provided in the command line
Mar 11 15:50:45 <glenneth>	BUT that's progress, right daviwil ?
Mar 11 15:51:17 <benoitj>	:D, even if i'm out of context, yes, having more information than before is progress
Mar 11 15:51:21 <daviwil>	glenneth: Make sure you're not taking the first item off of the `(command-line)` result list, apparently optargs-long expects it
Mar 11 15:54:19 <benoitj>	daviwil: that course uses geiser I guess
Mar 11 15:54:59 <glenneth>	daviwil: where did you find that snippet of information?
Mar 11 15:55:11 <daviwil>	benoitj: yep
Mar 11 15:55:51 <benoitj>	daviwil: did you try Andrew's nrepl for geiser/emacs?
Mar 11 15:56:09 <daviwil>	glenneth: I actually discovered it by running into the same problem when I experimented with your snippet, I saw that --target value wasn't showing up in the result list and my guess was that since --target was the first parameter being passed in, it was somehow being skipped.  turns out I was right!
Mar 11 15:56:26 <daviwil>	benoitj: we took at look at it on stream a few months back, it works to a basic level but not for enough along yet
Mar 11 15:56:30 <glenneth>	I'll need to re-assess my 'parse-arguments' section :)
Mar 11 15:56:33 <benoitj>	ok

Mar 11 16:05:56 <Marvin2>	hmph i was young so i guess
Mar 11 16:06:17 <trev>	exactly
Mar 11 16:06:47 <daviwil>	lol
Mar 11 16:07:27 <trev>	daviwil: what you said earlier about being torn between doing everything in elisp or outside of emacs reminded me of a segment in The Art of Unix Programming where ESR discusses Emacs
Mar 11 16:07:50 <Fade>	what did ESR say?
Mar 11 16:07:54 <trev>	(he is an emacs user)
Mar 11 16:09:47 <trev>	in my recollection, i thought he had a bias for emacs but he gave sound explanations of why you would choose a more minimal editor and why you would choose emacs...and even the "anti-religious" approach of using both
Mar 11 16:10:10 <naokotani>	trev: im going to solve that problem by rewrting emacs in fortran and when we can just do everything in fortran
Mar 11 16:10:14 <trev>	mostly he describes the history of why OG Unix devs disliked emacs and why the MIT crew loved it
Mar 11 16:10:19 <daviwil>	hey folks, quick poll - which site font do you like better between these two: https://systemcrafters.net OR https://staging.systemcrafters.net

Mar 11 16:10:30 <daviwil>	the font sizes will be adjusted, focus more on the readability of the text
Mar 11 16:11:29 <naokotani>	I like the EVBsH

Mar 11 16:14:38 <trev>	daviwil: did you comment out Gabarito font? i think that one is better 
Mar 11 16:14:42 <Marvin2>	daviwil: did the matrix bridge was down and i still did it, but people might be redundant. [SOLVED]. Now I only like two videos. an MF doom is quite loose.
Mar 11 16:14:59 <alternateved>	Nice Marvin2 
Mar 11 16:15:07 <trev>	people can be redundant 
Mar 11 16:15:13 <daviwil>	trev: I felt like the font weight of that one is too thick even at 100, it looks really nice otherwise
Mar 11 16:15:41 <trev>	new font seems too round for my liking. it is legible though 
Mar 11 16:16:07 <naokotani>	im a big legible enjoyer
Mar 11 16:16:19 <daviwil>	the original font is definitely not as readable for some reason
Mar 11 16:16:30 <daviwil>	I dunno if the letter shapes are too tall or something
Mar 11 16:17:24 <trev>	isn't it cause it's monospace?
Mar 11 16:17:47 <trev>	or similar to a monospace
Mar 11 16:18:02 <daviwil>	it's not exactly monospace, it's Iosevka Aile which is a bit more variable-width but not as much as a true serif font
Mar 11 16:18:05 <daviwil>	err sans-serif
Mar 11 16:18:21 <daviwil>	but it definitely feels monospace
Mar 11 16:20:36 <trev>	daviwil: got any more font choices? 
Mar 11 16:23:31 <daviwil>	Not at the moment, need to search a bit more
Mar 11 16:23:46 <Fade>	how are you bundling the font in the page?
Mar 11 16:27:16 *	Fade exposes his total lack of web chops
Mar 11 16:28:56 <trev>	web chops for lunch today?

Mar 11 16:55:48 <glenneth>	:D
Mar 11 16:57:07 <Fade>	excellent
Mar 11 17:02:37 <glenneth>	if i can get the --target option to work correctly and add some minor conflict handling tonight I'll be happy
Mar 11 17:03:03 <Fade>	sorry, what are you working on specifically?

Mar 11 17:27:15 <Fade>	!triggerahh. interesting
Mar 11 17:27:16 <Marvin2>	triggerahh.: unknown command.
Mar 11 17:27:19 <naokotani>	anyone have any clue how I might go about figuring out why that '~' is in my home folder?
Mar 11 17:27:40 <Fade>	come again?
Mar 11 17:27:47 <naokotani>	I linked a picture
Mar 11 17:28:22 <Fade>	by POSIX, tilde is a shell alias for $HOME
Mar 11 17:28:36 <morganw>	That looks like a file named ~
Mar 11 17:29:07 <morganw>	try: ls -al '~'
Mar 11 17:29:47 <Fade>	I misread what you were saying
Mar 11 17:30:06 <naokotani>	ok weird
Mar 11 17:30:07 <Fade>	if you do 'ls -il' you will be able to find the inode of the file
Mar 11 17:30:17 <naokotani>	I did that and foudn it had a .config in it
Mar 11 17:30:23 <naokotani>	with nothing but weechat config
Mar 11 17:30:31 <Fade>	then do 'find . -inum <inode-number> -exec rm -i {} \;'
Mar 11 17:30:32 <naokotani>	I had sort of thought it was related to weechat but wasnt sure how
Mar 11 17:31:00 <morganw>	You should just be able to delete it normally as long as the shell doesn't expand it
Mar 11 17:31:07 <Fade>	it's almost certainly a bug in the file handling logic of weechat.
Mar 11 17:31:25 <naokotani>	morganw: thats is what worries me...
Mar 11 17:31:31 <Fade>	at least in Bash, you're going to need to go through the inode.
Mar 11 17:31:35 <Marvin2>	at least from the trigger list, it uses Strings and inlcudes the table schema, but that's why you are probably vastly overcome by the lifetimes since you'll try to blame a line of pyhton in over 5 years
Mar 11 17:31:35 <naokotani>	i Iguess I could empty it and use rmdir to me sure
Mar 11 17:32:54 <Fade>	you can also refer to the file as ~/~ because the shell will only expand the first tilde.
Mar 11 17:33:24 <naokotani>	oh
Mar 11 17:33:33 <naokotani>	dired used it's super power to delete it
Mar 11 17:33:42 <Fade>	dired is pretty smart
Mar 11 17:33:45 <Fade>	:)
Mar 11 17:33:46 <morganw>	As long as it is quoted I wouldn't have thought you would need to do anything special to delete it.  It just needs to not expand.
Mar 11 17:33:48 <Marvin2>	As long as it runs everywhere easily.
Mar 11 17:34:10 <naokotani>	I tried it in quotes with rmdir and it said its not empty
Mar 11 17:34:21 <Fade>	I'm reaching into the ancient archives of my memory, but I recall having a problem with this in the past that required I use the inode.
Mar 11 17:34:24 <Marvin2>	I'm reaching into the ancient archives of my primary keys to be read some brain expert talking about
Mar 11 17:35:03 <morganw>	If it isn't empty then I don't think that is related to how to reference it, unless you are accidentally expanding it.
Mar 11 17:35:32 <naokotani>	well its gone and I ain't brining it back lol
Mar 11 17:35:32 <Fade>	that's true
Mar 11 17:35:57 <naokotani>	i definitely wasn't going to mess with rm -r '~'
Mar 11 17:36:06 <Fade>	you either went to some pains to create the file to begin with, or there's a file handler in your running software with a bug in it.
Mar 11 17:36:46 <naokotani>	Since it only had a .config and that only had weechat directory im going to go on a limb and assume wechat did it
Mar 11 17:37:05 <Fade>	that would be reasonable
Mar 11 17:37:14 <naokotani>	my GUESS is that wehnt I did the auto fonfig slash commands .config/weechat didn't exist so it tried to create it
Mar 11 17:37:31 <naokotani>	but thats a whild guess for sure
Mar 11 17:37:41 <Fade>	it's also possible that the directory file with the tilde name was created, and it messed with weechat's filename expansion code.
Mar 11 17:37:52 <naokotani>	true
Mar 11 17:37:56 *	naokotani shrugs
Mar 11 17:38:26 <Fade>	given the relative newness of your system installation, I'm guessing it was weechat, though.
Mar 11 17:38:41 <Fade>	otherwise I'd guess an entropy bug. :)
Mar 11 17:39:05 <naokotani>	I think I was messing with my HOME env variable
Mar 11 17:39:17 <naokotani>	because kanata doesn't defautling where it should
Mar 11 17:39:35 <naokotani>	but then I created a service adn put int he full path and fine
Mar 11 17:39:35 <Fade>	yeah. edge case.
Mar 11 17:39:54 <naokotani>	maybe if home is somehow incorrectly set it weird things
Mar 11 17:40:35 <naokotani>	but I did printenv and looked at everythign and didn't see anythign weird
Mar 11 17:41:06 <naokotani>	my capactity to break linux knows no bounds
Mar 11 17:41:07 <Fade>	you'd have to go spelunking in the weechat code to find out how it determines what the XDG_HOME is.
Mar 11 17:41:10 <Marvin2>	you'd have to 😉
Mar 11 17:41:35 <naokotani>	what kind of ssh key should I make
Mar 11 17:41:57 <naokotani>	for my vps
Mar 11 17:42:03 <shom>	o/ crafters!
Mar 11 17:42:11 <naokotani>	\o
Mar 11 17:42:55 <Fade>	i've been using ed25519 since quite a few years.
Mar 11 17:43:06 <naokotani>	that's what github says to do
Mar 11 17:43:21 <Fade>	but you might find better compatibility with an RSA key of high bitlength.
Mar 11 17:43:55 <Fade>	but I'd use RSA only if the ecdsa variant fails.
Mar 11 17:44:16 <naokotani>	ok. I can always make a second key if need be I guess
Mar 11 17:45:57 <shom>	Another vote for ed25519, I switched over from RSA a few years ago and haven't had any issues with ed25519 in the wild yet (for compatibility)
Mar 11 17:46:48 <Fade>	it should be the universal default to ssh-keygen at this point in history, imo.
Mar 11 17:46:56 <naokotani>	should I password protect it and figure out how to use ssh-agent?
Mar 11 17:47:06 <Fade>	I tend not to
Mar 11 17:47:20 <naokotani>	me too, but was curious what opinions were
Mar 11 17:47:26 <shom>	You should password protect it just in case you accidentally leak it
Mar 11 17:47:51 <Fade>	in practice it's an infinitesimal reduction in coverage
Mar 11 17:48:25 <Fade>	shom states the specific failure mode of concern. :)
Mar 11 17:48:27 <naokotani>	id h ave to leak it AND not know
Mar 11 17:48:29 <Marvin2>	id h ave to leak it
Mar 11 17:48:30 <benoitj>	I use the gpg-agent with ssh compat to leverage my yubikey gpg auth key
Mar 11 17:49:17 <Fade>	although I gotta say, if you're leaking private ssh keys, you have other bigger problems.
Mar 11 17:49:20 <Fade>	lol
Mar 11 17:49:30 <naokotani>	I was trying to figure out how I would go about that
Mar 11 17:49:34 <Marvin2>	I was told by my gang to play around!
Mar 11 17:49:34 <shom>	Fade: haha thanks, I feel like all opinoins should come with some context on why that's the thought process
Mar 11 17:49:35 <Marvin2>	Fade: haha thanks, I just feel like small town in northeast MS near Columbus
Mar 11 17:49:40 <benoitj>	Fade: :D
Mar 11 17:50:09 <naokotani>	accidentally turn my .ssh folder into a public git repo and then post it on reddit accidentally?
Mar 11 17:50:15 <shom>	also so many people/companies have committed secrets in repos without realizing sometimes for years
Mar 11 17:50:25 <Fade>	that would be one path to utter humiliation.
Mar 11 17:50:38 <naokotani>	api keys I can totally see
Mar 11 17:51:03 <Fade>	api keys are a real problem in that specific vector.
Mar 11 17:51:23 <naokotani>	my teacher had people signing up for things and getting API keys and then submitting them in assignemnts on our school thing
Mar 11 17:51:33 *	Fade blinks
Mar 11 17:51:44 <Fade>	your teacher is either a criminal or very very dumb.
Mar 11 17:51:45 <naokotani>	I mentioned that i didn't think that was a good practice
Mar 11 17:52:24 <naokotani>	this guy wanted me to help him and he posted his api key on discord
Mar 11 17:52:32 <Fade>	:|
Mar 11 17:52:35 <Fade>	good lord.
Mar 11 17:52:37 <shom>	It's add just enough friction to add another factor (especially for laptop and mobile where I use fingerprint unlock) without causing any friction in my workflow so I'm pro password.
Mar 11 17:52:40 <naokotani>	I was like ok this is the problem with your js, but hte bigger problem is posting your api keys on discord lol
Mar 11 17:53:15 <naokotani>	its not even THAT big a deal to unlock it every push/pull honestly
Mar 11 17:53:34 <Fade>	I use tramp a lot so I prefer not to interject a password prompt. ssh-agent is probably the way to go if you're really concerned.
Mar 11 17:53:36 <shom>	api keys are the new hunter2
Mar 11 17:53:51 <naokotani>	I guess for the vps its a bigger annoyance
Mar 11 17:54:05 <shom>	oh yeah, I use ssh-agent
Mar 11 17:54:25 <naokotani>	I've used it but never learned how to make it stay
Mar 11 17:54:31 <naokotani>	I guess I should...
Mar 11 17:54:37 <Fade>	it's considered best practice, but I find the regular password entry kind of a pain in the ass.
Mar 11 17:54:44 <Fade>	so I don't use it.
Mar 11 17:54:54 <Fade>	which is, I guess, kind of YOLO.
Mar 11 17:54:58 <Fade>	maybe I'm dumb.
Mar 11 17:55:10 <shom>	benoitj: I've been meaning to setup yubikey ssh but never got around to it. I wish my laptop had a NFC reader
Mar 11 17:55:35 <Fade>	benoitj's setup is specifically very bitchin'.
Mar 11 17:55:59 <naokotani>	i have no clue what that is
Mar 11 17:56:01 <Marvin2>	i have found sane settings for ERC telega etc. Why would you be switching out of your config so the editor
Mar 11 17:56:03 <benoitj>	shom: I have a yubikey nano, it lives in one of the usb port
Mar 11 17:56:05 <naokotani>	any post to team me?
Mar 11 17:56:10 <shom>	Fade: you're and expert, so you won't do anything dumb, but I worry about the people pasting keys in discord
Mar 11 17:56:24 <daviwil>	Information wants to be free
Mar 11 17:56:38 <daviwil>	That's why I license all my API keys under the GPL
Mar 11 17:56:55 <benoitj>	Fade: I know you're half trolling, but that setup is 3 lines in my nix config :P
Mar 11 17:57:08 <Fade>	well, it wants to diffuse to a higher state of entropy, for sure. :)
Mar 11 17:57:11 <shom>	benoitj: doesn't that defeat the the second-factor aspect somewhat to have it always attached?
Mar 11 17:57:29 <shom>	daviwil: hahahhahaha
Mar 11 17:57:34 <Fade>	lol
Mar 11 17:57:48 <Fade>	benoitj: well, the half that's not trolling is admiration. :)
Mar 11 17:57:53 <Fade>	it's a good practice.
Mar 11 17:57:58 <naokotani>	i think ideally id enter my password the first time after a reboot and then its just unlocked
Mar 11 17:58:15 <benoitj>	shom: the private keys are always in the yubikey, and you've got to enter a pin to unlock the key, and 3 times wrong, and it's locked "permanently"
Mar 11 17:58:22 <Fade>	although I've had bad experiences with smart tokens getting eaten by a deep old one when I wasn't looking.
Mar 11 17:58:25 <benoitj>	Fade: ok :)
Mar 11 17:59:07 <Fade>	I was a big fan of google authenticator for a time.
Mar 11 17:59:08 <naokotani>	lets face it, someone is more likely to figure out my digital ocean passowrd is password12345
Mar 11 17:59:13 <benoitj>	shom: even if someone was to use the unlocked key once, they would not be able to use it as soon as the agent requires the pin
Mar 11 17:59:56 <Fade>	and here we land at the knife-edge of security postures
Mar 11 17:59:58 <benoitj>	the first part is common to any use of agent, the last part is what you get to keep your private keys on the yubikey or any similar hardware keys
Mar 11 18:00:04 <shom>	benoitj: ahh I see, how often does the agent ask for the pin?
Mar 11 18:00:29 <naokotani>	apparently im going to the swing set
Mar 11 18:00:31 <Fade>	on one side, 'as much security as I can actually functionally tolerate' and on the other 'as much security as I can implement without turning off the machine.'
Mar 11 18:00:31 <naokotani>	ttyl
Mar 11 18:00:48 <shom>	bye naokotani
Mar 11 18:00:50 <benoitj>	shom: configurable, mine is set for couple of hours.
Mar 11 18:00:54 <Fade>	later, naokotani 
Mar 11 18:01:20 <benoitj>	shom: got to balance convenience with risks
Mar 11 18:01:26 <glenneth>	well.  I got it https://0x0.st/HhJj.txt
Mar 11 18:01:29 <Fade>	ezzackly
Mar 11 18:01:30 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/IxxJd ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 11 18:01:39 <glenneth>	Thanks
Mar 11 18:01:46 <glenneth>	agai
Mar 11 18:02:01 <daviwil>	Looks good glenneth 
Mar 11 18:02:05 <Fade>	is this your first full scheme program, glenneth?
Mar 11 18:02:08 <Marvin2>	is this outrider thing
Mar 11 18:02:08 <benoitj>	I get kind of the same convenience as not encrypting my ssh / gpg keys, but without giving direct access to the private keys
Mar 11 18:02:29 <glenneth>	Thanks again daviwil that was exactky the issue i was having
Mar 11 18:02:45 <benoitj>	shom: I have my original gpg key on couple of sd cards that I use to extend it every year
Mar 11 18:02:47 <Fade>	benoitj: that's why it's a good configuration.
Mar 11 18:02:55 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 11 18:03:09 <Fade>	when I redo my entire computational infrastructure hopefully this year, I'll likely follow a similar path.
Mar 11 18:03:29 <glenneth>	it is Fade yeah.  outside of the exercises that daviwil set for the course
Mar 11 18:03:33 <benoitj>	I just put in my calendar 1 week before it expires to manage my keys, extend it, and override the keys in my yubikeys
Mar 11 18:03:41 <shom>	yeah sorry, that's what I meant how long does your agent ask after. Gotcha... If it's good enough for you, maybe I should start using my nano with my laptop (I have a pair of 5C, one on my keyring and one attached to home desktop). I wish I could quantum entangle them, adding both is kinda annoying to any new service, luckily it's not often.
Mar 11 18:03:50 <Fade>	this seems pretty clean, to me.
Mar 11 18:04:16 <benoitj>	shom: I have a nano and a 5 nfc
Mar 11 18:04:24 <benoitj>	I pretty much only use the nano now
Mar 11 18:04:34 <Fade>	benoitj: what does the failure look like if you lose your hardware keys?
Mar 11 18:05:09 <benoitj>	I just reload from my sd cards
Mar 11 18:05:37 <benoitj>	got 3 copies of the original keys anyway to be able to extend them
Mar 11 18:05:42 <Fade>	I used my phone as a hardware key for quite awhile.
Mar 11 18:05:48 <Fade>	google authenticator was pretty nice
Mar 11 18:06:00 <shom>	Fade: and benoitj, great points on security vs convenience. I subscribe to what's the most I'll actually do without cursing my past self
Mar 11 18:06:02 <Marvin2>	Fade: and nm0i thanks so much easier to type unfortunetely
Mar 11 18:06:03 <glenneth>	it only parses individual files rn. so will continue to build on it and add functuinality.  For now I have a working model
Mar 11 18:06:05 <benoitj>	yeah, I use that for MFA too
Mar 11 18:06:17 <Fade>	until I had to reset my phone to factory settings, and only then found out that google backups which I had configured did not capture the state of authenticator.
Mar 11 18:06:19 *	nm0i slaps Marvin2 
Mar 11 18:06:26 <nm0i>	Morning all >.>
Mar 11 18:06:36 <Fade>	and I was quite thoroughly locked out of pretty much everything for a substantial period of time.
Mar 11 18:07:21 <benoitj>	I did loose my keys once. I just recreated these. since my "public" keys are only valid for a year, it's not that big of a deal
Mar 11 18:07:43 <shom>	hi nm0i, for real I wish Marvin wouldn't tag users but I guess it's nice to randomly summon crafters
Mar 11 18:07:45 <Fade>	this google auth experience really put me off 2fa.
Mar 11 18:07:46 <Fade>	lol
Mar 11 18:07:47 <nm0i>	Fade: is there a way to ask your lispy kid not to give one an unsolicited highlight?.. 
Mar 11 18:07:55 <benoitj>	keys as in, i messed up my backup by shredding the passphrase I used :D
Mar 11 18:08:08 <daviwil>	glenneth: excellent progress so far! 
Mar 11 18:08:25 <Fade>	hum...
Mar 11 18:08:34 <Fade>	it'd be quite weird without any proper nouns.
Mar 11 18:08:39 <shom>	Fade: that's my nightmare scenario, I religiously backup my recovery codes but I'm sure it'll screw me someday
Mar 11 18:09:01 <shom>	*someday when I'm away from home
Mar 11 18:09:27 <Fade>	are you notified on mentions?
Mar 11 18:09:33 <daviwil>	I am
Mar 11 18:09:53 <daviwil>	Marvin loves waking me up at on call hours 
Mar 11 18:09:58 <Fade>	:/
Mar 11 18:10:10 <daviwil>	Just kidding, I don't have notification sounds turned on, I'm not a maniac 
Mar 11 18:10:24 <nm0i>	I am... I would rather remain notified from this channel but I guess it'd be better for opsec to learn to ignore highlights from specific users.
Mar 11 18:10:30 <daviwil>	My mind is already a pinball machine without it
Mar 11 18:10:35 <benoitj>	daviwil: you need ICQ wav notification ;)
Mar 11 18:10:40 <daviwil>	Uh oh! 
Mar 11 18:10:48 <Fade>	nm0i: perhaps you should set your client to ignore the bot
Mar 11 18:10:53 <BigEatie>	Howdy folks
Mar 11 18:11:22 <BigEatie>	Apparently there's a Chess module for ERC. Anyone up for a game, and want to figure out how to use it with me?
Mar 11 18:11:23 <nm0i>	Fade: I don't want to ignore it completely... He is cute.
Mar 11 18:11:40 <Fade>	I don't know how to deal with your feature request.
Mar 11 18:12:14 <nm0i>	Don't, I'll just look into ignoring highlights based on source, thanks for the idea.
Mar 11 18:12:23 <Fade>	I guess I could implement some feature to alias your handle by specifically requesting it in a command.
Mar 11 18:12:58 <Fade>	like !unmentionme
Mar 11 18:13:14 <BigEatie>	Ahh, yes, make us all the result of a hash function
Mar 11 18:13:24 <BigEatie>	all our names the result of a hash function*
Mar 11 18:13:51 *	nm0i blushes, "Oh my, I've never been inside of a hash function before..."
Mar 11 18:13:52 <Fade>	it keeps track of who is here for the purpose of having it ignore users who are annoyed by its nonsense.
Mar 11 18:14:13 <BigEatie>	nm0i is henceforth known 55f7591eb802683a26e2e52b8eff95cf27f2d861
Mar 11 18:14:18 <Fade>	so it already has a hash of everybody. if you issue an !ignoreme command
Mar 11 18:14:37 <Fade>	it will ignore everything you say unless that utterance is '!ignoreme off'
Mar 11 18:14:59 <Fade>	but this will not stop it from uttering something based on its chaining history.
Mar 11 18:15:26 <BigEatie>	We're all hashes in this grand computer called the universe anyway
Mar 11 18:15:39 <Fade>	I would imagine eigenvectors
Mar 11 18:15:43 <nm0i>	It's fine, I guess, Fade, I was mostly just surprised by the summon.
Mar 11 18:15:44 <Fade>	but okay. :)
Mar 11 18:16:04 <Fade>	I'm not adverse to trying to fix the problem. I'm just thinking out loud.
Mar 11 18:16:12 <BigEatie>	Fade: The hashes are isomorphic to the eigenvectors so its all the same
Mar 11 18:16:20 *	Fade grins
Mar 11 18:16:25 <nm0i>	BigEatie: that's sir 55f7591eb802683a26e2e52b8eff95cf27f2d861 for you!
Mar 11 18:18:33 *	BigEatie offers his humblest apologies
Mar 11 18:19:10 *	Fade opens the bots head in emacs
Mar 11 18:19:29 <BigEatie>	Now to fix its positronic neural net.....
Mar 11 18:20:38 <BigEatie>	Fade, is Marvin on one of the git forges? Would love to take a look as well
Mar 11 18:21:02 <Fade>	!sources
Mar 11 18:21:04 <Marvin2>	sources:: https://github.com/fade/harlie.git
Mar 11 18:21:46 <Fade>	it also self-hosts its source, so you can read it online here: http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/source
Mar 11 18:23:00 <Fade>	huh. there's a bug there. you'll have to use github. :)
Mar 11 18:23:04 <BigEatie>	Getting internal server errors from deepsky when attempting to open the code, just fyi
Mar 11 18:23:55 *	Fade puts a todo on the web-server.lisp file.
Mar 11 18:28:02 <shom>	Fade: as long as you're considering things about Marvin, I was put-off by (him/it) until I realized Marvin was a bot... I hope no one quits right away because they think an user is a jerk. Basically I would have liked if the name of the bot made it clear it was a bot that was learning. I do enjoy Marvin for the record, I think the additional entropy to a mass conversation is great.
Mar 11 18:28:05 <Marvin2>	Fade: as long as it's not there yet lol. Ive got all of us all, except for my thesis work) but just amazing
Mar 11 18:29:10 <shom>	hahhaa case in point, hilarious entropy
Mar 11 18:29:22 <benoitj>	shom: I did have to say at least twice that it was our drunk bot
Mar 11 18:32:56 <Fade>	yeah, I looked at changing his name, but the length of handles in the libera irc implementation of the protocol is pretty short.
Mar 11 18:33:32 <Fade>	I hoped by giving it the name of a well-known robot, it'd be obvious
Mar 11 18:34:54 <benoitj>	c3p42?
Mar 11 18:35:29 <Fade>	I guess I could keep some state about the users it has seen and just say something about his ontological eigenvector the first time it sees a handle, but that would trigger every time somebody joined with a different handle.
Mar 11 18:35:31 <Marvin2>	I guess not?
Mar 11 18:36:03 <benoitj>	that colud be good
Mar 11 18:36:20 <Fade>	NOTE: I am a bot.
Mar 11 18:36:31 <Fade>	it would be saying this kind of a lot.
Mar 11 18:36:45 <benoitj>	NOTE: I am a bot. I'm on training, and sometimes I sounds like I'm drunk
Mar 11 18:36:47 <benoitj>	:D
Mar 11 18:36:49 <Marvin2>	NOTE: I am looking at custom injection mould companies 🤣
Mar 11 18:36:57 <benoitj>	haha
Mar 11 18:37:03 <Fade>	lol
Mar 11 18:38:02 <shom>	Marvin is a well-known robot if you're from a particular time and places. I didn't get the connection until after I realized Marvin was a bot. How about MarvBot (still 7 chars) or other combos that are longer like MarvinBot, MarvinDaBot DaBot (pronounced like benoitj) sounds like a classy last name
Mar 11 18:38:07 <Fade>	I could privmsg the user from the bot the first time they show up, but this might be percieved as more annoying/aggressive than just not knowing it's an artificial idiot.
Mar 11 18:38:54 <glenneth>	https://git.sr.ht/~glenneth/guile-stash
Mar 11 18:38:58 <Marvin2>	[ https://git.sr.ht/~glenneth/guile-stash ]::[ Couldn't fetch this page. ]
Mar 11 18:39:08 <benoitj>	yeah, in channel message is quite enough. and it also kind of remind people that are less present here that it's our crazy bot
Mar 11 18:39:09 <glenneth>	;D
Mar 11 18:39:10 <Marvin2>	yeah, in channel message is quite loose.
Mar 11 18:40:03 <glenneth>	proud moment
Mar 11 18:40:09 <Fade>	this is good. this is the largest channel it has ever been joined to, so these are new issues to consider.
Mar 11 18:40:18 <Fade>	nice job, glenneth 
Mar 11 18:40:19 <shom>	glenneth: the repo might be private
Mar 11 18:41:08 <shom>	Fade: maybe an in channel message the first time a new member messages?
Mar 11 18:41:10 <Marvin2>	Fade: maybe an aqcuired taste
Mar 11 18:41:20 <shom>	hahahhahahahah
Mar 11 18:41:40 <Fade>	shom: that's what I was saying. :)
Mar 11 18:41:45 <shom>	Marvin2: is self aware about it creator, run!!!!
Mar 11 18:42:03 <Fade>	I didn't know if it'd be more annoying than just letting the user discover that the handle is attached to a ridiculous process.
Mar 11 18:42:27 <shom>	Ah, good deal, sorry I misunderstood when you guys were talking about channel joins, I get it now!
Mar 11 18:42:46 <benoitj>	Fade: he was kind of annoying when he knew 2-3k phrases
Mar 11 18:42:56 <glenneth>	public now shom thanks
Mar 11 18:42:57 <benoitj>	he kept always interupting
Mar 11 18:43:02 <Fade>	repitition is the mother of annoyance
Mar 11 18:43:04 <Fade>	ask any toddler
Mar 11 18:43:16 <benoitj>	now he's kind of jumping at the right time with hilarious messages
Mar 11 18:43:28 <Fade>	that effect is caused by the fact that the trigger code is a stochastic process
Mar 11 18:43:47 <Fade>	over time it will accumulate more and more uncommon words, and it will quiet down.
Mar 11 18:43:56 <shom>	To me, it might be more annoying to existing crafters but more welcoming to new crafters. I tend to take that bet but I'm not always here so take it with a grain of Marvin2
Mar 11 18:44:05 <Fade>	in the beginning, by definition, the words are likely to be likely.
Mar 11 18:44:24 <Fade>	I'm looking at the feature now.
Mar 11 18:44:33 <benoitj>	Fade: you've got to add an additional trigger to "shut.*up Marvin2", some users tell him that, would be fun if they got a nice reply from him :P
Mar 11 18:44:46 <shom>	that's so interesting, I love seeing Marvin2 learn in real time
Mar 11 18:44:58 <Fade>	!status
Mar 11 18:45:01 <Marvin2>	status:: I know 91,819 phrases.
Mar 11 18:45:10 <Fade>	some days are better than others
Mar 11 18:45:11 <benoitj>	wow, we'll reach 100k this week
Mar 11 18:45:12 <Fade>	:)
Mar 11 18:45:16 <shom>	!trigger
Mar 11 18:45:18 <Marvin2>	trigger:: waifus, soccer, urge, make, medly, have, apply, putting, nutrition, while
Mar 11 18:45:33 <benoitj>	some of his messages are like soccer punch
Mar 11 18:45:35 <Marvin2>	some of the snakeguy supercut
Mar 11 18:45:38 <Fade>	some of those words aren't likely to happen unless auntie cow shows up. :D
Mar 11 18:45:43 <shom>	waifus as a trigger is just perfect
Mar 11 18:45:45 <Marvin2>	waifus as a behind-the-scenes thing for you Marvin2 Stay out of marvin
Mar 11 18:45:49 <Fade>	first one wins
Mar 11 18:46:03 <Fade>	s/one/match
Mar 11 18:46:20 <Fade>	!trigger
Mar 11 18:46:22 <Marvin2>	trigger:: urge, make, medly, have, apply, putting, nutrition, while, love, libraries
Mar 11 18:48:28 <Fade>	the first iteration of the bot used to respond when it was mentioned 
Mar 11 18:48:42 <Fade>	this lead to arguements between people that didn't know it was a bot and the bot
Mar 11 18:48:48 <Fade>	which was amusing, but not very friendly.
Mar 11 18:49:13 <Fade>	s/argue/argu
Mar 11 18:49:24 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 11 18:49:25 <shom>	glenneth: nice project and I like the documentation you wrote, very cool!
Mar 11 18:49:52 <Fade>	I could throw triggers in like easter eggs
Mar 11 18:50:01 <Fade>	but they wouldn't be specifically adaptive
Mar 11 18:51:17 <shom>	glenneth: one question I had about the recursive functionality, is this for a use case where a target folder already exists and you want a subset of files to be symlinked from the source (as opposed to symlinking the whole folder)
Mar 11 18:55:35 <barocio>	Did anyone notice that gitu is written in RUST? Just saying…
Mar 11 18:58:11 <barocio>	http://0x0.st/HhJ6.png

Mar 11 19:00:13 <barocio>	Gitu: http://0x0.st/HhJI.png

Mar 11 19:01:09 <glenneth>	shom: that functionality will be added.  right now it's limited to individual files.  I'm hoping for it to be a GNU stow alternative
Mar 11 19:01:11 <Marvin2>	shom: that actually sounds pretty good!
Mar 11 19:03:28 <shom>	barocio_: that's really nice, I like that I can use my magit muscle memory
Mar 11 19:03:30 <Marvin2>	barocio_: that's really cool
Mar 11 19:05:41 <shom>	glenneth: nice, I see. I don't understand the current recursive all-files in folder symlink function (since I would just symlink the parent folder), but I don't need to get :) congrats on the first scheme project that's awesome!
Mar 11 19:13:30 <glenneth_>	shom: yeah. needs some fine tuning for directory traversal, error checking user permissions and so on. it's all on my TODO list 😁 Thank you
Mar 11 19:15:07 <glenneth_>	several hours ago, it wouldn't even read a single file lol
Mar 11 19:19:24 <Fade>	poor program
Mar 11 19:19:24 <shom>	glenneth: I'm glad I was around for the origin story of your first public repo!
Mar 11 19:19:35 <Fade>	waiting for the creator to catch up! :)
Mar 11 19:22:51 <glenneth_>	Thoroughly enjoyed it shom 
Mar 11 19:26:56 <trev>	barocio: gitu seems nicer than lazygit
Mar 11 19:27:06 <trev>	i will keep an eye on it
Mar 11 19:27:10 <trev>	maybe even try it out!
Mar 11 19:30:55 <Fade>	.oO(Why would I be working with git and not emacs... ?)
Mar 11 19:31:09 <Fade>	'splain please
Mar 11 19:32:20 <naokotani>	Fade: Approximatetly what temp would your recommend to drink black tea at?
Mar 11 19:33:13 <Fade>	I only drink black currant tea, which is made with black tea, and I've never looked into the temperature of the water after it has exited the kettle and steeped.
Mar 11 19:33:20 <Fade>	so... IDK?
Mar 11 19:33:39 <Fade>	is there a correct answer?
Mar 11 19:34:25 <trev>	if i stay here long enough i think that i'll find a way to live in emacs even if i'm living like a poor psychotic man
Mar 11 19:34:44 <naokotani>	I just assumed you would have an opinion on the matter
Mar 11 19:34:46 <Marvin2>	I just got my feet up right now
Mar 11 19:34:48 <Fade>	my question was genuine...
Mar 11 19:35:08 <Fade>	i'm having trouble imagining the scenario where I have a featured terminal, and git, but not emacs.
Mar 11 19:35:30 <naokotani>	hard to imagine
Mar 11 19:35:39 <Fade>	what is the use-case of a magit clone on the terminal?
Mar 11 19:36:19 <Fade>	a premptive strike to prevent emacs from stealing neovim users? :)
Mar 11 19:36:21 <Marvin2>	a premptive strike to prevent emacs from hell stream
Mar 11 19:36:30 <Fade>	ah, hell stream. I know it wewll.
Mar 11 19:36:54 <Fade>	s/wew/we
Mar 11 19:37:15 <naokotani>	so, yubikey requires me to buy a 50 dollar gizmo, so thats probably not happening
Mar 11 19:37:35 <Fade>	physical tokens cost money
Mar 11 19:37:39 <Fade>	for sure
Mar 11 19:37:59 <naokotani>	That's fair and reasonable, I just don't see myself buying one right now
Mar 11 19:38:08 <Fade>	also fair
Mar 11 19:38:40 <Fade>	for reasons already covered, I think 2fa without an actual dedicated hardware token is a bad idea.
Mar 11 19:39:39 <naokotani>	a bad idea of not worth the bother?
Mar 11 19:40:17 <naokotani>	I can't believe im spending my afternoon paralyzed with indecision about my ssh key
Mar 11 19:40:19 <Fade>	when I balanced the threats and probable adversaries of my compute infrastructure, that's the conclusion that felt correct to me.
Mar 11 19:41:04 <trev>	Fade: serious answer is RIIR most likely
Mar 11 19:41:09 <Fade>	if you're facing state actors, I'd probably use the hardware token, and make sure it wasn't keyed to anything that could be physically cut off of my body.
Mar 11 19:41:11 <Marvin2>	if you're into scheme / lisps and especially if you have a jaccuzi but imma just shower tonight
Mar 11 19:41:19 <trev>	hahah
Mar 11 19:41:35 <daviwil>	The Summer Effect 
Mar 11 19:41:52 <Fade>	The bot is distinctly more charmins since she came back.
Mar 11 19:42:06 <naokotani>	Now that you meation it, we do get a lot of updates on her show behaviour
Mar 11 19:42:12 <naokotani>	shower*
Mar 11 19:42:31 <Fade>	zoomers feel guilty when they miss messages
Mar 11 19:42:34 <trev>	who bathes in a jacuzzi? 
Mar 11 19:42:36 <Fade>	irc is a lossy medium.
Mar 11 19:42:57 <naokotani>	trev: people who aren't plebs?
Mar 11 19:43:20 <Fade>	the tub in the master bathroom at my family domicile when I was a child was a jacuzzi.
Mar 11 19:43:32 *	trev sits and cries in pleb tub
Mar 11 19:43:35 <Fade>	although I quickly learned that you don't put bubble bath in a jacuzzi.
Mar 11 19:43:58 <Fade>	suddenly... IBIZIA!
Mar 11 19:45:15 <naokotani>	So here is my philosophy. If it's important enough that I need to put a password on the key to keep it safe, its important enought spend 50 bucks on a physical token
Mar 11 19:45:31 <Fade>	I see we are on the same page.
Mar 11 19:49:57 <Fade>	naokotani: why did you ask about black tea?
Mar 11 19:50:19 <naokotani>	My black tea is around 50c and it triggered me a bit
Mar 11 19:50:31 *	Fade chuckles
Mar 11 19:50:50 <Fade>	is that too cold?
Mar 11 19:50:57 <naokotani>	for black tea
Mar 11 19:51:11 <Fade>	I don't mind black currant tea when it's cold
Mar 11 19:51:34 <naokotani>	I drink gyokuro green tea around 50 for the first steep
Mar 11 19:51:41 <Fade>	but straight black tea is a lot more pungent.
Mar 11 19:51:42 <naokotani>	40-50 
Mar 11 19:51:52 <Fade>	I'm really not a tea afficionado.
Mar 11 19:52:10 <naokotani>	Sorry, I shouldn't have assumed. That's rude of me
Mar 11 19:52:15 <Fade>	I drank black currant tea because it had the most caffeine in the tea rack
Mar 11 19:52:22 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 11 19:52:47 <naokotani>	I am a tea afficnando, im also poor so I usually drink off the shell black tea
Mar 11 19:53:07 *	Fade nods
Mar 11 19:53:30 *	sahil_ nods as well
Mar 11 19:59:29 <shom>	trev and barocio_ I appreciate the non-emacs tools/chat, keep it coming. Not everything NEEDS to be in emacs evenn if it is wonderful that emacs can do everything.
Mar 11 20:01:28 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 11 20:01:43 <naokotani>	I was trying to edit my ssh config
Mar 11 20:01:44 <trev>	shom: take cover, grenade incoming!!!
Mar 11 20:01:51 <shom>	Fade: sincere reply to use case, tramp is slow and clunky for me to use (because I'm not proficient) so for remote systems I really like being able to ssh and do quick config changes on the terminal but I do miss magit when I do that. So that's exactly where a gitu would be cool.
Mar 11 20:02:03 <naokotani>	all of a sudden my mouse goes wild and starts pasing stuff and going crazy
Mar 11 20:02:06 <Marvin2>	all of your undoing
Mar 11 20:02:22 <naokotani>	and I realize my son had my wireless mouse and was playing with it
Mar 11 20:02:40 <Fade>	shom: fair enough
Mar 11 20:03:05 <naokotani>	yeah I agree with shom
Mar 11 20:03:19 <shom>	naokotani: hahaha see this is why you need to password protect yourkeys, computers can't be trusted *goes back into faraday cage* /s
Mar 11 20:04:15 <Fade>	shom is the second person that has described tramp as clunky in the past couple of weeks, so it must be real, but I basically never feel that way when I'm using it.
Mar 11 20:04:33 <Fade>	this could just be down to the fact that it saves me a context switch. i don't know.
Mar 11 20:04:47 <naokotani>	I use evil, so its not really a context switch
Mar 11 20:05:26 <shom>	trev: they're just emacs love grenades :D
Mar 11 20:05:30 <naokotani>	nvim with like 10 lines of config is all I really need to edit quite happily
Mar 11 20:05:34 <Fade>	I mean, by switching to the terminal executing the ssh login procedure to the remote, and then navigating to the code repo and issuing the git commands.
Mar 11 20:05:36 <Marvin2>	I mean, both are doing okay. Got a good data source
Mar 11 20:05:49 <Fade>	that context switch.
Mar 11 20:06:19 <Fade>	even with network latency, i'm faster in tramp.
Mar 11 20:06:36 <naokotani>	yeah idk a terminal is super q and then I need to write ssh and then the alias name
Mar 11 20:07:15 <naokotani>	which I have to write anyway for tramp...
Mar 11 20:07:20 <Fade>	if this is your main workflow, then optimisations are likely. :)
Mar 11 20:07:29 <trev>	ssh FadeWorkstation1
Mar 11 20:07:33 <Fade>	I run tramp almost completely out of bookmarks.
Mar 11 20:07:33 <trev>	oops wrong window
Mar 11 20:07:55 <naokotani>	when I do use tramp, I use bookmarks
Mar 11 20:08:03 <naokotani>	like I do bookmark my server
Mar 11 20:08:39 <naokotani>	I use it here and there. sometimes syntax highlighting is nice
Mar 11 20:09:13 <naokotani>	to the extent nvim isn't able to do it
Mar 11 20:10:53 <naokotani>	also
Mar 11 20:11:07 <naokotani>	I find myself needing root to edit files frequently
Mar 11 20:11:25 <naokotani>	which I find convinient to do with sudoedit
Mar 11 20:12:28 <shom>	Fade: that's what I meant about me not being proficient, I don't have bookmarks and I don't use remote machines enough to really learn better tramp usage and setup good habits and workflow. I hit the wrong key combo and all of a sudden emacs is stalled getting stuff from remote server, all of it comes down to lack of skill but building that skill is not zero cost.
Mar 11 20:13:13 <Fade>	zero-cost is a fallacy :)
Mar 11 20:13:19 <Fade>	but I understand what you mean.
Mar 11 20:13:46 <shom>	I also worry about becoming a one trick pony who can't do anything without my highly custom config. I help a lot of folks on their machines so having proficiency in widely available tooling is more helpful for me personally
Mar 11 20:14:37 <shom>	You're right, if I always worked in a tool or environment building skill is totally worth it. 
Mar 11 20:17:27 <shom>	I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything, just sharing my view. But I like knowing things outside of emacs even for things that I choose to do in emacs and asking the "why not emacs" for everything feels a little discouraging. Hope everyone will take that in the spirit it's meant: I love emacs and want to get better but I also want to talk about other things and encourage others as well
Mar 11 20:18:47 <shom>	yikes, that's a wall of text, my bad. that's what we get when I'm kanata'd up on my laptop and feel comfy typing on it.
Mar 11 20:19:18 <Fade>	:)
Mar 11 20:20:39 <Fade>	happily I'm not the only one bloviating around here. 
Mar 11 20:22:23 <shom>	Bloviating Vascillations is going to be the name of my album
Mar 11 20:22:37 <shom>	or podcast!
Mar 11 20:24:04 <Fade>	track 1: What's your fucking SSH key?
Mar 11 20:24:22 <Fade>	track 2: So 2 factor?
Mar 11 20:24:33 <Fade>	oh wait... that's naokotani's album.
Mar 11 20:30:51 <naokotani>	go ahead, make fun of the new guy
Mar 11 20:31:17 <naokotani>	poor innocent defensely nao
Mar 11 20:32:35 <Fade>	sure, you're a wee puppy, until you find a tank to drive into prague. ;)
Mar 11 20:34:37 <naokotani>	budapest?
Mar 11 20:35:20 <Fade>	I just figured the velvet revolution would have been an affront. :D
Mar 11 20:35:23 <Marvin2>	I just "subscribe" to people, start doing scheme
Mar 11 20:35:32 <naokotani>	oh 1968 prague
Mar 11 20:36:38 <naokotani>	one of my many criticism of the ussr is they held on to some of those countires that had no reason really to be in the ussr
Mar 11 20:36:59 <Fade>	imperialist scum.
Mar 11 20:37:32 <naokotani>	I just think a yugoslavia style setup would hav ebeen better
Mar 11 20:37:34 <Marvin2>	I just played
Mar 11 20:38:11 <naokotani>	if they felt like they had more autonomy socialism might have stuck, but when confronted with the old spectre of Russian chauvanism they probably would have been against just about anything
Mar 11 20:38:54 <Fade>	getting punched in the face puts people off, whether they deserve it or not.
Mar 11 20:40:44 <naokotani>	honestly I think the betrayal of the other allies played a big part as well. If there had been more of an effort for peaceful coexistence maybe things would hav ebeen better, but sadly we live in reality
Mar 11 20:41:26 <naokotani>	the ussr could have been led by jesus christ himself and it would have been too much of a threat to the west
Mar 11 20:42:03 <Fade>	I think the megadeath made an impression on nascent sattelites, but I'm not ezzackly a scholar on soviet union genesis.
Mar 11 20:43:08 <naokotani>	neither am I. I do know that's its very complicated and that their politic system was well down the list of reasonst he cold war happened
Mar 11 20:43:15 <zos>	most of my grandfather's siblings died at the hands of the USSR...
Mar 11 20:43:31 <Fade>	my impression is that the revolution was stillborn, and the fetus got up and rampaged around eastern europe.
Mar 11 20:43:44 <naokotani>	I mean
Mar 11 20:43:46 <naokotani>	no
Mar 11 20:43:53 <naokotani>	the nazis invaded lol
Mar 11 20:44:09 <naokotani>	and there was a power vacuum
Mar 11 20:44:15 <Fade>	zos: my first wife grew up in the polish block of the ussr. it was pretty grim.
Mar 11 20:44:38 <naokotani>	a lot of the former ussr continues to look pretty grim
Mar 11 20:44:45 <naokotani>	and it was grim before the soviets
Mar 11 20:45:28 <Fade>	the megadeath in particular said everything needing said about the so called socialist revolution in russia.
Mar 11 20:45:29 <naokotani>	the grimness appears to have deeper roots and complex causes
Mar 11 20:45:35 <zos>	was it? The soviets implemented depopulation on a fairly large scale 
Mar 11 20:45:47 <Fade>	to whit
Mar 11 20:45:55 <naokotani>	yea, the russian empire was grim
Mar 11 20:46:01 <naokotani>	that;s not up for debate lol
Mar 11 20:46:03 <naokotani>	sorry
Mar 11 20:46:05 <trev>	yeah it is
Mar 11 20:46:22 <zos>	having double digit % of the population eliminated tends to have long term negative consequences
Mar 11 20:46:32 <naokotani>	when did that happen?
Mar 11 20:47:07 <zos>	That is how Stalin pacified the Baltic states
Mar 11 20:47:07 <trev>	joe steel
Mar 11 20:47:12 <daviwil>	alright, let's avoid topics that can't really be discussed well in a channel about computer stuff :)
Mar 11 20:47:23 <naokotani>	thanks daviwil 
Mar 11 20:47:23 *	Fade laughs
Mar 11 20:47:39 <Fade>	it's nonsense all the way down. :)
Mar 11 20:48:24 <trev>	history started on January 1, 1970 anyway
Mar 11 20:48:35 <trev>	prove me wrong!
Mar 11 20:48:57 <benoitj>	this is the year of the first computer, right?
Mar 11 20:49:46 <trev>	i think so
Mar 11 20:50:01 <Fade>	it's the date of unix first boot
Mar 11 20:50:18 <benoitj>	the date of enlightenments
Mar 11 20:50:42 <benoitj>	it's the ADA (After dark age)
Mar 11 20:51:56 <naokotani>	the real question is after all of this why ssh is still asking for a password
Mar 11 20:52:13 <Fade>	it can sense your doubt
Mar 11 20:52:15 <benoitj>	ssh-add -l
Mar 11 20:52:26 <benoitj>	you see your key there?
Mar 11 20:52:48 <naokotani>	I think the server is asking for my user password
Mar 11 20:52:59 <benoitj>	ah, then unmatched key
Mar 11 20:53:13 <benoitj>	ssh -vvv I think to get super verbose stuff
Mar 11 20:53:28 <naokotani>	oh ok. I thought password authentication was off ill try that
Mar 11 20:53:56 <benoitj>	ssh-copy-id some-server is one way to send your key to the server
Mar 11 20:54:00 <naokotani>	oh, yeah
Mar 11 20:54:09 <naokotani>	its not finnding the key
Mar 11 20:54:19 <naokotani>	you weren't kidding when you said super verbose 
Mar 11 20:54:24 <naokotani>	just got the servers life story
Mar 11 20:54:46 <naokotani>	do I send it to root or the user? 
Mar 11 20:58:02 <benoitj>	which remote user will you connect to? and first of all, you should never have remote root ssh access with password
Mar 11 20:58:05 <Marvin2>	which remote user will you be transferring to a bunch of ts on your phase. Just I used RDE, I got a dj here
Mar 11 21:00:34 <naokotani>	I needed it to get the server back
Mar 11 21:00:54 <naokotani>	so send it to the user... ok. that's what I did weird
Mar 11 21:12:09 <zos>	I am thinking of trying to work through SICP and the lecture videos from the 80s. I know they have a fairly good reputation from some LISP enthusiasts... Any thoughts? 
Mar 11 21:12:11 <naokotani>	oh it as some kind of PAM authentication
Mar 11 21:12:12 <Marvin2>	I am going to solve that problem too. Although having a big fan of Mozart.
Mar 11 21:12:28 <naokotani>	allowing password access
Mar 11 21:19:01 <BigEatie>	Oh boy, missed a heavy conversation
Mar 11 21:21:16 <naokotani>	Fade started it. im innocent i promise
Mar 11 21:22:02 <trev>	shom: https://github.com/NeogitOrg/neogit
Mar 11 21:22:05 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/bNjsy ]::[ GitHub - NeogitOrg/neogit: An interactive and powerful Git interface for Neovim, inspired by Magit ]
Mar 11 21:23:04 <benoitj>	naokotani: /etc/ssh/sshd_config has "allow root password" somewhere
Mar 11 21:23:51 <naokotani>	yeah. That was off. something called PAM was on and I read the docstring and it said it can override password off
Mar 11 21:24:01 <naokotani>	not really sure whta that is
Mar 11 21:27:04 <shom>	trev: that's neat. I do have a super minimal neovim config... hmm :)
Mar 11 21:28:03 <shom>	alright folks, catch you later. I'll be working on track 3: systemd or nah? ;)
Mar 11 21:28:19 <benoitj>	pam is the mechanism to do login and authorization on linux (priviledge access management). it's a modular system that allows to have different backend for authentication and authorization, and different rules based on services
Mar 11 21:29:49 <naokotani>	oh so like you could have a specfic rule for scp/ssh
Mar 11 21:29:52 <naokotani>	or something I guess
Mar 11 21:30:02 <naokotani>	or use something other than ssh entirely
Mar 11 21:31:54 <benoitj>	kind of, or use a LDAP as a backend password / group db. 
Mar 11 21:31:55 <naokotani>	the best part about breaking things is all the learning yu get to do fixing it
Mar 11 21:32:01 <benoitj>	in most cases, you dont care about pam
Mar 11 21:32:05 <zos>	I vaguely remember (from a Red Hat training) that PAM is considered very important, and I seem to remember running into issues with it and ssh-agents, but it is one of those things that does not come up for end users that much
Mar 11 21:32:06 <benoitj>	you leave it alone :D
Mar 11 21:32:07 <Marvin2>	I vaguely remember (from a Red arrow pointing at before you gotta. it's like..required.
Mar 11 21:32:27 <naokotani>	oh lol i disabled it
Mar 11 21:32:42 <naokotani>	it seemed like it was allowing password access
Mar 11 21:32:46 <benoitj>	did you disabled it? or just told sshd to ignore it?
Mar 11 21:33:10 <naokotani>	ssh specifically
Mar 11 21:33:48 <benoitj>	yeah, it may still there but not used by ssh
Mar 11 21:34:51 <benoitj>	but from what you told me, i'm suspicious of your OS. that sounds like a bad one considering you had to turn off pam to allow accessing ssh with keys which is more secure than password
Mar 11 21:35:21 <naokotani>	USEpam no
Mar 11 21:35:23 <naokotani>	is whwat I put
Mar 11 21:35:36 <benoitj>	gentoo?
Mar 11 21:35:40 <naokotani>	its ubuntu
Mar 11 21:35:48 <benoitj>	ok, I never had to mess around with this
Mar 11 21:35:48 <naokotani>	maybe im confused (im probably confused)
Mar 11 21:36:03 <benoitj>	the sshd_config was from the default install?
Mar 11 21:36:10 <naokotani>	well lol
Mar 11 21:37:11 <naokotani>	yes, but my son is on ym desk and Im relagated to an occasional chair and he started playing with the mouse when I was in the sshd_config file
Mar 11 21:37:28 <naokotani>	I SHOULD have :q!
Mar 11 21:38:08 <naokotani>	but I thought I fixed what he did, but perhaps I didn't
Mar 11 21:38:23 <naokotani>	thankfully this server is not exactly mission critial to anything
Mar 11 21:39:12 <naokotani>	it actually took me quite a while to realize what happened. I thought my computer was having some kind of seizure
Mar 11 21:39:14 <Marvin2>	it actually took me a day
Mar 11 21:39:38 <daviwil>	zos: i have heads good things about the lectures but I haven't tried to watch them yet
Mar 11 22:12:21 <cowboy8625>	hey hey!
Mar 11 22:19:10 <cowboy8625>	i am on mac and for some reason my emacs will spawn two windows on start up.  The second one is a file I have not opened in emacs before it auto opening it.
Mar 11 22:19:13 <Marvin2>	i am going ot murder me if I eat too much fun in here when i find myself low on energy.
Mar 11 22:40:07 <cowboy8625>	How is everyone/
Mar 11 22:40:24 <BigEatie>	 Good, how are you
Mar 11 22:40:31 <cowboy8625>	not bad!
Mar 11 22:40:52 <cowboy8625>	been working on moving over to emacs from vim.
Mar 11 22:40:55 <Marvin2>	been working at this debug adapter thing dape which is basically stable
Mar 11 22:41:02 <BigEatie>	Nice!
Mar 11 22:41:04 <BigEatie>	How's that going
Mar 11 22:41:07 <cowboy8625>	oh nice!
Mar 11 22:41:07 <Marvin2>	How's that going to be allocated to the http protocol
Mar 11 22:41:19 <BigEatie>	Marvin2 is a bot
Mar 11 22:42:15 <cowboy8625>	BigEatie: Its going well! I spent a lot of time working on setting up each language and now im trying to get debugging working for typescript
Mar 11 22:42:22 <cowboy8625>	its been quit tricky
Mar 11 22:42:42 <BigEatie>	Yea, I'm 3 or 4 years in now, still a noob lol
Mar 11 22:42:52 <cowboy8625>	lol
Mar 11 22:44:15 <cowboy8625>	trying to see if there is a way to have a fully working web browser in emacs and not just eww.
Mar 11 22:46:16 <BigEatie>	You're on mac, so EXWM is not an option -- I've heard people use x-widgets for that kind of thing, have no idea what that is really though
Mar 11 22:46:21 <BigEatie>	Also no idea if it works on mac
Mar 11 22:48:07 <cowboy8625>	i am on mac but thats for work.  Linux at home.   I do want to get EXWM working on both to maybe help with streamlining work flows.
Mar 11 22:48:09 <Marvin2>	i am sure I will make a gopher site
Mar 11 22:48:21 <cowboy8625>	ill look up the project! thanks!
Mar 11 22:48:54 <BigEatie>	I really like EXWM
Mar 11 22:49:25 <cowboy8625>	i need to start using it sooner rather then later
Mar 11 22:50:40 <BigEatie>	Tried it out for shits and giggles, never looked back (until I tried hyprland, which definitely tempted me)
Mar 11 22:51:00 <BigEatie>	But yea, that's one sure way to use a browser in Emacs
Mar 11 22:51:07 <BigEatie>	Always bugged me that I couldn't do that back when I was on i3
Mar 11 22:51:09 <Marvin2>	Always bugged me that I was left in a few years ago
Mar 11 22:51:17 <cowboy8625>	lol
Mar 11 22:51:29 <cowboy8625>	ill he to look up hyprland
Mar 11 22:51:49 <BigEatie>	I mean, it's pretty, not sure it's more functional though
Mar 11 22:53:16 <cow_2001>	trev: aaaaa
Mar 11 23:06:35 <cowboy8625>	ill be back after
Mar 11 23:06:38 <cowboy8625>	dinner
Mar 12 00:24:49 <cowboy8625>	back

Mar 12 00:59:03 <naokotani>	I downloaded ranger and thought "I should alias this to r, lets type r in my terminal and see what it does now"
Mar 12 00:59:23 <naokotani>	oh.. well that was easy
Mar 12 00:59:39 <cowboy8625>	hey hey is there a way to only enable a keybinding in emacs using evil mode where when im am in some-mode and normal state a keybinding is active.  I am using general as well and didnt quit understand how to achieve this.
Mar 12 00:59:41 <Marvin2>	hey hey is there a garbage collector in rust?
Mar 12 00:59:44 <benoitj>	:)
Mar 12 00:59:54 <cowboy8625>	i like vifm over ranger
Mar 12 01:00:18 <benoitj>	cowboy8625: yes there is a way
Mar 12 01:01:03 <naokotani>	Marvin2: no
Mar 12 01:02:23 <benoitj>	cowboy8625: general-define-key
Mar 12 01:02:44 <naokotani>	is that the general package?
Mar 12 01:02:58 <benoitj>	you can specify the map to extend (the mode specific map), and "STATES" it applies
Mar 12 01:05:45 <benoitj>	something like (generral-define-keys :keymaps 'some-mode-map :states '(normal) "some key" #'some-command)
Mar 12 01:05:53 <benoitj>	naokotani: yeah
Mar 12 01:06:10 <benoitj>	you may have to play a bit with it, but it's close
Mar 12 01:06:12 <Marvin2>	you may have to ask sandrine she's the expert
Mar 12 01:06:16 <naokotani>	yeah I used to use general a lot. its pretty powerful
Mar 12 01:07:05 <cowboy8625>	ohhh ok! thanks! i will give it a shot
Mar 12 01:07:48 <benoitj>	I use the same, but to remap keys in specific modes, but the doc shows it also accept "states" as input
Mar 12 01:08:36 <naokotani>	It's also good as a way to just keep all or most of your keybinds localized to keep track of them
Mar 12 01:08:39 <Marvin2>	It's also possible that the average monthly here
Mar 12 01:09:10 <benoitj>	naokotani: yeah, I do that. and use :general keyword in use-package
Mar 12 01:10:53 <BigEatie>	cowboy8625: something like this? https://0x0.st/Hhwr.txt
Mar 12 01:10:57 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/aZHBY ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 12 01:11:02 <BigEatie>	I use nvmap quite a bit as well...

Mar 12 01:11:15 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/dcxTI ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 12 01:14:16 <naokotani>	Never knew about SetEnv in ssh config. quite handy if you don't want ot set it on the other end
Mar 12 01:15:52 <benoitj>	BigEatie: looks like I read the doc right :P
Mar 12 01:18:18 <cowboy8625>	benoitj: so `:keymaps` is what is bind to the mode?  I am trying to rebind neotree rename file to `r` if im in normal mode and in a neotree buffer
Mar 12 01:19:58 <benoitj>	cowboy8625: yeah, that key is defined in a neotree of some sort keymap.
Mar 12 01:20:57 <benoitj>	just go in the proper mode, then C-h k then type the key you want to override, you should should get enough info to find the keymap
Mar 12 01:21:00 <Marvin2>	just go full FSF style open source projects, and limited to individual files. I'm hoping
Mar 12 01:21:33 <benoitj>	typically -map added to the mode activated
Mar 12 01:22:14 <benoitj>	dired-mode-map for example. they are also variables ;), so C-h v can give you it's help
Mar 12 03:28:24 <cowboy8625>	hey hey!
Mar 12 03:29:04 <naokotani>	ho! ho!
Mar 12 03:29:13 <benoitj>	hey ho
Mar 12 03:43:54 <BigEatie>	Hey, ef-themes now has ERC colors
Mar 12 03:44:23 <naokotani>	and I just configured weechat themes
Mar 12 03:44:25 <naokotani>	rip
Mar 12 03:45:24 <BigEatie>	Yea I just did the whole erc override of ef-themes last week
Mar 12 03:45:58 <benoitj>	i use vivendi-tinted
Mar 12 03:46:25 <BigEatie>	I normally use my own, which is a dark-theme, but if I'm out in sunlight I'll usually opt for ef-maris 
Mar 12 03:46:29 <BigEatie>	ef-maris-light*
Mar 12 03:47:51 <BigEatie>	Hmm, some of it clashes a bit
Mar 12 03:47:59 <BigEatie>	I think I prefer my own spin on it
Mar 12 03:48:09 <naokotani>	Seems to look ok for me
Mar 12 03:49:07 <BigEatie>	I prefer notifications to be a little less conspicuous, and I dunno, I just feel like there isn't enough contrast on my own messages, at least not on ef-maris-light
Mar 12 03:49:41 <BigEatie>	Is WeeChat an emacs thing, or is that a totally separate client?
Mar 12 03:50:01 <naokotani>	its a terminal client
Mar 12 03:50:18 <BigEatie>	Gotcha.
Mar 12 03:50:19 <naokotani>	it works well, but its a real paint to beautify
Mar 12 03:55:03 <benoitj>	BigEatie: I do something similar with the "sunlight" theme

Mar 12 07:49:53 <cow_2001>	glenneth the manual you've linked was for the guile 1.8 version - http://gnu.ist.utl.pt/software/guile/docs/docs-1.8/guile-ref/Included-Guile-Modules.html
Mar 12 07:49:54 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/zzoDN ]::[ Included Guile Modules - Guile Reference Manual ]
Mar 12 07:55:47 <cow_2001>	glenneth there is a procedure in (ice-9 getopt-long) used for getting options called option-ref
Mar 12 07:56:08 <cow_2001>	it has some extra stuff you could use
Mar 12 07:58:38 <cow_2001>	it's in Guile Modules > getopt-long > option-ref Reference https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/option_002dref-Reference.html
Mar 12 07:58:41 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/jKmUh ]::[ option-ref Reference (Guile Reference Manual) ]
Mar 12 07:59:56 <cow_2001>	by the way, if there are no non-flaggy options in `some-options` here `(option-ref some-options '() #f)`, the result is not #f, but '(), which is annoying
Mar 12 08:00:23 <cow_2001>	for any other key, if it wasn't part of the command line arguments, it would have returned #f
Mar 12 08:25:19 <glenneth>	so it HAS to be an option with a flag? 
Mar 12 08:49:40 <alternateved>	Good morning
Mar 12 08:49:55 <glenneth>	hey alternateved o/
Mar 12 08:52:54 <glenneth>	daviwil: is it ok to create a guile scheme sub-category under Programming on the forum?
Mar 12 08:53:56 <daviwil>	glenneth: I'm going to switch to using tags for languages, tools, etc, so you can start now by tagging your post as #guile
Mar 12 08:55:05 <glenneth>	ok.  I do recall a previous conversation about that.  Just wanted to double check.  Thanks :)
Mar 12 08:56:57 <glenneth>	and why am i so anxious all of a sudden about posting about guile-stash? :D
Mar 12 08:57:57 <daviwil>	it's always weird posting about a new project, but you'll be fine :)
Mar 12 08:59:18 <glenneth>	it does feel weird.  Was just about to post and.... self-doubt lol
Mar 12 09:41:19 <daviwil>	Finished the style refresh, I think it looks a lot better: https://systemcrafters.net/
Mar 12 09:41:21 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/AWjWg ]::[ Welcome! - System Crafters ]
Mar 12 09:44:13 <glenneth>	Nice
Mar 12 09:45:30 <alternateved>	Looks great, though I wonder if font isn't a bit on the small side
Mar 12 09:46:19 <daviwil>	Desktop or mobile? 
Mar 12 09:47:55 <alternateved>	Desktop
Mar 12 09:48:19 <glenneth>	daviwil how to add a tag on a forum post please? search box only shows #news
Mar 12 09:53:08 <alternateved>	daviwil: but maybe those are just my settings, would be great to get input of others
Mar 12 09:53:47 <daviwil>	alternateved: appreciate the input!  I don't want it to feel too small.  i'll tweak it a bit more
Mar 12 09:53:54 <glenneth>	alternateved: you need a bigger monitor :D
Mar 12 09:54:04 <daviwil>	glenneth: Interesting, I guess it doesn't let people arbitrarily create tags
Mar 12 09:54:07 <daviwil>	let me add one
Mar 12 09:54:17 <glenneth>	thanks
Mar 12 09:54:28 <alternateved>	glenneth: I have 27-inch one
Mar 12 09:56:17 <glenneth>	lol.  same.
Mar 12 09:56:24 <daviwil>	glenneth: try it now, I added #guile and #scheme
Mar 12 10:02:10 <glenneth>	thanks daviwil just got a call from my boss.  post it when i get finished
Mar 12 10:02:12 <Marvin2>	thanks daviwil just got super hungry looking at a pizza shop owned by albanians in Japan and I fall asleep about 80% of the bigger problem.
Mar 12 10:02:58 <daviwil>	Marvin's off the rails
Mar 12 10:03:05 <glenneth>	haha Marvin2 on form
Mar 12 10:03:28 <alternateved>	Oh wow, that sounds like a hell of a delirium 
Mar 12 10:03:30 <Marvin2>	Oh wow, maybe don't join the greek tourism development department
Mar 12 10:03:51 <alternateved>	Ahaha, on point
Mar 12 10:04:02 <glenneth>	just gets better
Mar 12 10:36:29 <glenneth>	posted
Mar 12 10:40:55 <daviwil>	congrats glenneth!  i'll mention this in the newsletter and stream this week :)
Mar 12 10:44:43 <glenneth>	that was unexpected, but thanks daviwil going to update the readme and thank the systemcrafters community.  Everyone i got advice from was soo helpful and supportive.  Made it a great experience, and a good base to add to I think 
Mar 12 10:48:13 <glenneth>	struggled with it for a couple of weeks and then it just started coming together :)
Mar 12 10:50:28 <daviwil>	you were persistent!  it was only a matter of time
Mar 12 11:16:57 <thanosapollo>	Morning crafters! 
Mar 12 11:21:42 <trev>	hey thanosapollo
Mar 12 11:22:40 <trev>	about your forum post, it's nice to remember that once upon a time emacs and vim were split 50/50 in popularity
Mar 12 11:22:43 <Marvin2>	about your interview
Mar 12 11:25:00 <thanosapollo>	I was baby when that was the case :) 
Mar 12 11:34:43 <glenneth>	hey thanosapollo o/ trev \o 
Mar 12 11:35:11 <trev>	hey glenneth 
Mar 12 11:35:13 <trev>	a
Mar 12 11:44:49 <trev>	daviwil: before you left you should've leaked the source code for the vscode remote ssh extension
Mar 12 11:45:16 <trev>	it would've solved a lot of issues with remote development in other editors
Mar 12 11:45:42 <trev>	they were doing some real magic with that and no one could seem to replicate it well
Mar 12 12:17:01 <daviwil>	trev: looks like an obfuscated version of the JS can be extracted from the .vsix file (just rename it to .zip)
Mar 12 12:17:04 <Marvin2>	trev: looks like cons cells
Mar 12 12:17:12 <daviwil>	not the same, obviously, but maybe answers can be found
Mar 12 12:18:10 <naokotan1>	interesting. I tried to isntall jitsi-meet on my server. not only did it not work, but it broke the server
Mar 12 12:18:17 <trev>	i though they had some code baked into vscode for it too
Mar 12 12:18:34 <daviwil>	that part I'm not sure about
Mar 12 12:19:00 <trev>	looks like cons cells
Mar 12 12:19:02 <naokotan1>	also, good morning
Mar 12 12:19:15 <naokotan1>	also, its my birthday! im 39 years young today
Mar 12 12:19:21 <daviwil>	happy birthday sir
Mar 12 12:19:25 <trev>	wow happy birthday
Mar 12 12:19:43 <naokotan1>	whatcha tryin' to fix trev?
Mar 12 12:20:03 <trev>	nothin, just day dreaming
Mar 12 12:20:23 <alternateved>	happy birthday naokotan1 
Mar 12 12:20:39 <trev>	my new printer just came and i think the guy that delivered it was a vampire cause he was dressed in a suit and had long straight hair
Mar 12 12:21:08 <naokotan1>	trev: They are getting bad. Thick with vampires around here
Mar 12 12:21:15 <alternateved>	Or Nick Cave trev 
Mar 12 12:21:18 <naokotan1>	thanks alternateved 
Mar 12 12:21:28 <daviwil>	they hire vampires so that they don't have to worry about their employees staring in the mirror all dya
Mar 12 12:21:43 <naokotan1>	can vampires take selfies?
Mar 12 12:22:07 <daviwil>	let's kick off a seance to ask the restless spirit of Steve Jobs
Mar 12 12:22:49 <trev>	alternateved: similar!!
Mar 12 12:24:21 <alternateved>	ha, see?!
Mar 12 12:24:26 <alternateved>	Do you live in Brighton?
Mar 12 12:24:28 <trev>	let's give steve job's ghost some tougher questions like how to install guix on a macbook air
Mar 12 12:28:27 <thanosapollon>	How can you make toasters more like Emacs? 
Mar 12 12:28:30 <Marvin2>	How can you turn your head it sounds like adventure. I always thought it was a russian orchestra also
Mar 12 12:30:03 <trev>	thanosapollon: is this a riddle?
Mar 12 12:30:52 <BigEatie>	Happy birthday naokotan1!
Mar 12 12:39:34 <glenneth>	Happy Birthday naokotan1 
Mar 12 12:39:47 <naokotan1>	thanks BigEatie glenneth 
Mar 12 12:43:08 <trev>	what will you do for your birthday, naokotan1 ?
Mar 12 12:43:40 <naokotan1>	going to go for a walk
Mar 12 12:43:46 <naokotan1>	and my wife is making a pie
Mar 12 12:54:20 <glenneth>	🎉
Mar 12 12:54:31 <naokotan1>	trev: you saved my life
Mar 12 13:01:24 <naokotan1>	oh that's cool
Mar 12 13:01:43 <naokotan1>	when you delete something with tramp it will scp it to your local trash?
Mar 12 13:01:46 <Marvin2>	when you greet everyone back on doing it after i obsess over the html and react stuff
Mar 12 13:10:45 <trev>	naokotan1: how did i save it?
Mar 12 13:11:20 <naokotan1>	oh you told me to put build instructions in my readme. I lost some stuff and since I had the build instructions I knew what to do
Mar 12 13:11:22 <Marvin2>	oh you use Marvin2?
Mar 12 13:11:59 <trev>	oh awesome
Mar 12 13:12:21 <trev>	triple "oh"s!

Mar 12 13:19:31 <naokotan1>	im enjoying this setup
Mar 12 13:20:10 <naokotan1>	I have emacs take up most of the screen and then I have a bunch of tabbed terminals to the left (my monitor is lsightly off set ot the left)
Mar 12 13:22:02 <naokotan1>	then I have super hjkl to move windows and super u to cycle tabs. I need to change the tab colors. its currently not really readable
Mar 12 13:25:35 <glenneth>	naokotan1: nice :)
Mar 12 13:26:17 <trev>	naokotan1: you should try a little padding in the terminal and in emacs
Mar 12 13:26:20 <trev>	around the edges
Mar 12 13:26:50 <naokotan1>	um. im happy with the emacs padding
Mar 12 13:26:59 <naokotan1>	the terminal yeah
Mar 12 13:27:13 <naokotan1>	id probably do about 10px
Mar 12 13:27:36 <naokotan1>	10-20
Mar 12 13:28:11 <naokotan1>	what would be nice is if I could change it based on whether its full screen or not
Mar 12 13:28:28 <naokotan1>	id go way higher on the terminal padding in feel screen
Mar 12 13:28:34 <naokotan1>	full*
Mar 12 13:29:25 <trev>	i mean the internal padding, not the window manager. like set in kitty and in emacs
Mar 12 13:29:27 <Marvin2>	i mean I can't believe the added nothing to d2r seasons 6
Mar 12 13:29:45 <alternateved>	Ah, d2r season 6 was pretty dope
Mar 12 13:29:55 <naokotan1>	what? they literally did nothing
Mar 12 13:30:05 <naokotan1>	its the same as season 4...
Mar 12 13:30:25 <naokotan1>	anyway, yeah I would change it in kitty
Mar 12 13:30:39 <alternateved>	What terminal is that btw?
Mar 12 13:30:48 <naokotan1>	its kitty

Mar 12 13:32:05 <alternateved>	Yeah, it is AFK but it will be back Marvin2 
Mar 12 13:32:27 <alternateved>	Though I debate Gnome/KDE from time to time
Mar 12 13:32:38 <naokotan1>	for some reason I am getting weird line height in my org setup stuff
Mar 12 13:40:37 <naokotan1>	the padding looks a bit funny with neovim. I should just use the terminal background instead of whatever astrovim sets
Mar 12 13:40:47 <naokotan1>	anyway going to get a coffee at the store

Mar 12 14:42:10 <Fade>	lies. you do very bad things to the browser fairly regularly.

Mar 12 14:42:53 <naokotan1>	Marvin's long term memory is sqlite?
Mar 12 14:43:03 <Fade>	postgresql
Mar 12 14:43:29 <naokotan1>	I have a bad habit of using sqlite for bots so they are more portable
Mar 12 14:43:58 <glenneth>	on the way to 100,000 phrases.
Mar 12 14:44:03 <Fade>	this specific bot has been running for a very long time in several extremely long lived channels.
Mar 12 14:44:04 <glenneth>	cool
Mar 12 14:44:06 <Marvin2>	cool to update but only have PDFs of. I think 2fa without an editor or producer y ou want to ask sandrine she's the expert
Mar 12 14:44:07 <Marvin2>	this specific quirk is endemic to any use of them on cpu only.
Mar 12 14:44:17 <Fade>	the systemcrafters context is the first new one in ~10 years
Mar 12 14:44:37 <naokotan1>	oh. I have no idea what upper limits are on sqlite
Mar 12 14:44:39 <trev>	can we get to 1 million??
Mar 12 14:45:05 <Fade>	09:44 < semaphor> status:: I know 5,605,023 phrases.
Mar 12 14:45:16 <Fade>	'Yes'.
Mar 12 14:45:49 <naokotan1>	max size of sqlite is 140 TB, but I assume things get janky before that
Mar 12 14:45:52 <Marvin2>	max size of sqlite is 140 TB, but I am leaning towards this being worse than the actual training code for handling links, I wonder if it doesn't matter, all based on its way out grocery shopping. I'll check that I know you've meant good luck)
Mar 12 14:46:17 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 12 14:46:21 *	Fade laughs
Mar 12 14:46:43 <Fade>	!haiku
Mar 12 14:46:43 <naokotan1>	Marvin was being unsuually coherent for a bit and then he just went way off topic
Mar 12 14:46:46 <Marvin2>	Marvin was a power tool free for open source. Bitwarden is what deafeated Marvin1?
Mar 12 14:46:50 <Marvin2>	haiku:: some nice features to / browsing directly to the / level of interest
Mar 12 14:47:31 <naokotan1>	oh I didn't see your command I thought he did the haiku himself was becoming an emergent conciousness
Mar 12 14:47:32 <Fade>	the Beneficient Celestial Electron appears to be with his stochastic probability this morning.
Mar 12 14:47:32 <trev>	he's getting very vocal right now
Mar 12 14:48:09 <Fade>	frequency rises and falls with the trigger list and the frequency count of the words it contains.
Mar 12 14:48:55 <naokotan1>	according to this the max rows in a sqlite table is 264
Mar 12 14:49:16 <Fade>	sqlite is fine for small requirements
Mar 12 14:49:37 <naokotan1>	do I have rows and columns mixed up in my head or does 264 seem small
Mar 12 14:49:43 <Fade>	this bot has pretty large word tables supporting the markov chaining logic.
Mar 12 14:50:16 <Fade>	264 columns is quite a few, but I've seen database tables that weren't insane with more.
Mar 12 14:50:18 <Marvin2>	264 columns is quite confusing; it's almost like you can use goguma on my way out
Mar 12 14:50:25 <Fade>	medical databases in particular have a great many columns.
Mar 12 14:50:42 <naokotan1>	rows
Mar 12 14:51:05 <naokotan1>	264 columns seems fine to me
Mar 12 14:51:19 <Fade>	264 rows would not be enough rows for any real use; I suspect your report to be errant.
Mar 12 14:51:22 <Marvin2>	264 rows would not be strictly necessary
Mar 12 14:51:28 <naokotan1>	yeah
Mar 12 14:51:55 <naokotan1>	It hink its a typo because the next thing is saying max columns is 32767
Mar 12 14:52:34 <Fade>	I have this system wallpaper downloader that strip-mines the wallhaven.cc website, which tends to collect a great many image files
Mar 12 14:52:41 <naokotan1>	postgres max rows per table is  4.2 billion, tough bigger
Mar 12 14:53:01 <Fade>	at the moment, the code indexes everything when it starts up, but I've been planning to put that index in sqlite.
Mar 12 14:53:43 <naokotan1>	if you are already connected to a postgresql db why not use that?
Mar 12 14:54:31 <naokotan1>	wow a postgres field can be up to a 1GB
Mar 12 14:55:22 <Fade>	because it makes giving the code to other people a big job for them, as opposed to just assuming that I can open a file in their XDG_HOME and save the index to that file with sequent logic.
Mar 12 14:55:26 <Marvin2>	because it had no eyebrows,b ut otherwise seemed very healthy for 78
Mar 12 14:55:39 <Fade>	which is the real super power of sqlite.
Mar 12 14:55:46 <Fade>	it's already everywhere.
Mar 12 14:56:15 <naokotan1>	oh. yeah thats why Iw as saying I used it for bots, but if it had that kind of demands id probably go to the effort to set up a postgresql db
Mar 12 14:56:45 <naokotan1>	which, if you give detailed instructions isn't rocket science really

Mar 12 14:58:15 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/czDjX ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 12 14:58:36 <Fade>	the lisp image Marvin is running in is connected to a shared table which serves every context in the image
Mar 12 14:58:53 <Fade>	so that's the number of phrases every instance has seen over a decade plus.
Mar 12 14:59:02 <Fade>	in this case, something like postgres is warranted.
Mar 12 15:00:28 <Fade>	it also runs on an actual live to the internet server, so depending on an actual relational database system isn't out of spec for the software type.
Mar 12 15:01:39 <naokotan1>	yes I support the decision

Mar 12 15:03:56 <naokotan1>	that looks like a fun job at my college
Mar 12 15:03:59 <Marvin2>	that looks like a claw machine thing
Mar 12 15:04:23 <Fade>	being a DBA is a difficult job on the spectrum of IT jobs.
Mar 12 15:04:26 <Marvin2>	being a bit
Mar 12 15:05:00 <naokotan1>	For sure, but they are looking for a student/graduate
Mar 12 15:05:11 <naokotan1>	notice compensation: 18$
Mar 12 15:05:26 <Fade>	it goes from months and maybe years of basically nothing but incremental work, to stark raving terror on christmas eve at 4am.
Mar 12 15:05:43 <naokotan1>	so basically being a ship captain
Mar 12 15:05:47 <Fade>	kind of
Mar 12 15:06:20 <Fade>	where the ship is ephemeral and incredibly valuable and depends on you being a total ninja as soon as you lurch out of sleep on christmas eve at 4am. ;D
Mar 12 15:06:45 <naokotan1>	like when the mate I had told me they switched the fuel tanks but didn't and then informeted they didn't when teh engine started sputtering as I was coming into dock in a busy quay
Mar 12 15:06:48 <Marvin2>	like when i'm running hugo then hugo server
Mar 12 15:06:54 <Fade>	I'm not even sure if this is minimum wage in ontario
Mar 12 15:07:05 <naokotan1>	this is Nova Scotia
Mar 12 15:07:15 <naokotan1>	The pay is clearly abysmal
Mar 12 15:07:17 <naokotan1>	but the job looks fun
Mar 12 15:07:45 <Fade>	I think if it's in competition with other jobs for similar money that wouldn't likewise spiff your resume, it's probably the one to apply to.
Mar 12 15:07:47 <Marvin2>	I think
Mar 12 15:08:13 <naokotan1>	judging by my classmates im definitely in the upper echelon of database know how
Mar 12 15:08:42 <Fade>	after talking to you for about a month, I'd say so.
Mar 12 15:08:49 <Fade>	particularly after you have described your classes.
Mar 12 15:11:38 <Fade>	they aren't delivering an education to anybody inside the institution that could take that job successfully with only what they taught in the school. :)
Mar 12 15:11:52 <naokotan1>	um
Mar 12 15:11:54 <naokotan1>	no lol
Mar 12 15:12:05 <Fade>	so you look like an actual jedi
Mar 12 15:12:19 <naokotan1>	realtively speaking, yes
Mar 12 15:13:55 <Fade>	if you want a letter of recommendation, I'll write it.
Mar 12 15:14:42 <naokotan1>	oh wow, thanks
Mar 12 15:14:42 <trev>	plot twist: naokotan1 is in prison and all the classmates are serial killers and gang members
Mar 12 15:14:54 *	Fade laughs
Mar 12 15:15:15 <naokotan1>	trev: more like runescape addicts
Mar 12 15:15:33 <trev>	oh no, they're time travelers from 2005???
Mar 12 15:16:04 <naokotan1>	I guess. they are constantly posting in the discord with Runescape flexes
Mar 12 15:16:15 <Fade>	you've spent over a month talking about fairly abstruse technical subjects with me and others around here, and in that time generated at least one piece of custom software that I found personally interesting. that's better info than I'd get in a three hour hiring gauntlet in a pretty thorough job interview.
Mar 12 15:16:18 <Marvin2>	you've spent over a month I think. I need to take a call. You use Hugo trev ?
Mar 12 15:16:27 <trev>	hahah
Mar 12 15:16:34 <trev>	yeah, i do, marv
Mar 12 15:16:46 <naokotan1>	I do love abutruse technical subjects
Mar 12 15:16:50 <Fade>	careful. he might start humping your leg, trev.
Mar 12 15:17:11 <trev>	down, bot, down!!
Mar 12 15:17:57 *	glenneth hands trev a rolled up newspaper
Mar 12 15:20:22 <naokotan1>	one thing I haven't really done is work on database frontends for normies
Mar 12 15:20:25 <Marvin2>	one thing that python and a half hours stuck in linux class
Mar 12 15:20:56 <naokotan1>	well, I guess that's exactly what encounter builder is...
Mar 12 15:20:58 <Fade>	if you can come to terms with the rust type system, a little CRUD app is going to be cake.
Mar 12 15:21:01 <trev>	database frontends = web apps
Mar 12 15:21:01 <Marvin2>	if you don't know it wewll.
Mar 12 15:21:29 <naokotan1>	I also have created several discord bot db frontends. ok I lied
Mar 12 15:22:54 <Fade>	the difficult work of database engineering happens where the schema meets the relational engine.
Mar 12 15:23:06 <naokotan1>	very much so
Mar 12 15:23:22 <Fade>	everything else is 'open a cursor, and create read update or delete'.
Mar 12 15:23:58 <naokotan1>	yeah, building a sane schema and then designing sane joins and so on
Mar 12 15:24:01 <Marvin2>	yeah, building a sane schema and then spam it 20 times and then if you were right, not working on a saturday afternoon 🤣
Mar 12 15:24:17 <Fade>	database stuff *really* benefits from KISS.
Mar 12 15:24:24 <naokotan1>	and then finding a systematic way to migrate
Mar 12 15:25:08 <Fade>	I suspect that your college already has a database
Mar 12 15:25:16 <Fade>	I'd be money it's MS-SQL
Mar 12 15:25:20 <Fade>	s/be/bet
Mar 12 15:25:24 <naokotan1>	would be a bit odd if they didn't
Mar 12 15:25:41 <Fade>	so it'll be a job of introspection and measurement.
Mar 12 15:26:06 <naokotan1>	ok I can put my yoga experince in my cover letter. im an introspection master
Mar 12 15:26:38 <Fade>	think of it like looking for the chaffing points on an old rig.
Mar 12 15:27:15 <naokotan1>	yeah I tyhink tht's what its going ot be yeah. I doubt im going ot be starting from scratch to build a college databse that has like 10 campuses
Mar 12 15:27:17 <Marvin2>	yeah I just assumed you were only just trying to keep that scratchpad window on top
Mar 12 15:27:20 <naokotan1>	for 18 an hour lol
Mar 12 15:27:58 <Fade>	frankly, at that hourly, I can't imagine they have more expectations than "candidate must actually be alive."
Mar 12 15:28:35 <naokotan1>	must know that a database isn't a HQ for Data from Star Trek
Mar 12 15:28:37 <Fade>	it probably drives the active directory setup across every campus.
Mar 12 15:28:56 <Fade>	it's running on a PentiumII loaded with Windows NT 3.51
Mar 12 15:29:06 <naokotan1>	lol
Mar 12 15:29:18 <naokotan1>	well I know for a fact all their infrastructure is microsoft
Mar 12 15:29:23 <naokotan1>	ebcause I interact with it daily
Mar 12 15:29:34 <Fade>	some wit will have tied the access keypad to the machineroom to this active directory server.
Mar 12 15:30:08 <Fade>	go forth and walk on water!
Mar 12 15:31:21 <Fade>	this is ezzackly what happened to amazon in their last big outage.
Mar 12 15:31:24 <Marvin2>	this is why I'm looking forward to the stream today ~_~
Mar 12 15:31:51 <naokotan1>	remember the github ddos or whatever?
Mar 12 15:31:53 <Fade>	global authentication went down, and they couldn't get into any of their datacenters to fix the problem because the keypads couldn't authenticate at the doors.
Mar 12 15:32:24 <naokotan1>	and I said it could be a geopolitcal foe. Idk if you say but there is a bunch of stuff int ehnews that came out after that MS got hacked by some Russian hackers
Mar 12 15:32:27 <Marvin2>	and I said triggered it? thnx benoitj
Mar 12 15:32:58 <naokotan1>	I think we are entering an era where security is going to be REALLY important
Mar 12 15:33:07 <Fade>	*entering*??
Mar 12 15:33:09 <naokotan1>	not that it wasn't already, but nex tlevel
Mar 12 15:33:18 <Fade>	I've been running red teams for like twenty years.
Mar 12 15:33:20 <Fade>	lol
Mar 12 15:33:21 <Marvin2>	I've been treating it as some kind of errors put rockets down
Mar 12 15:33:21 <naokotan1>	well from REALLY to REALL REALLY
Mar 12 15:33:49 <Fade>	I'm a little surprised, given everything you've talked about, that your college hasn't been hit by a massive ransom ware attack.
Mar 12 15:33:52 <Marvin2>	I'm a bad idea of having an nntp mirror?..
Mar 12 15:34:03 <naokotan1>	my brother does R & D for the government and he is constantly complaining about h ow bad it is
Mar 12 15:34:05 <Marvin2>	my brother is an anti typing extremist
Mar 12 15:34:35 <naokotan1>	obiouslly thats going ot be a high priority target though
Mar 12 15:34:36 <Fade>	your brothers are all shards of yourself.
Mar 12 15:34:38 <Marvin2>	your brothers are all correct.
Mar 12 15:34:47 <Fade>	also, usually, true.
Mar 12 15:34:55 <naokotan1>	my brother is an anti typing extremist lol
Mar 12 15:35:32 <naokotan1>	my wife is. She writes word documents on her phone
Mar 12 15:35:39 <naokotan1>	with swipe keyboard
Mar 12 15:36:06 <talos>	GOOD morning all
Mar 12 15:36:13 <Fade>	good lord
Mar 12 15:36:17 <Fade>	heya, talos
Mar 12 15:36:21 <naokotan1>	Meanwhile I go into cold sweats when I have ot touch my mouse
Mar 12 15:36:26 <naokotan1>	oposites attract I guess
Mar 12 15:36:29 <naokotan1>	talos: morning
Mar 12 15:36:36 <Fade>	I can't watch my wife use her computer.
Mar 12 15:36:39 <talos>	Heyo Fade and naokotan1
Mar 12 15:36:41 <Fade>	it actually causes anxiety.
Mar 12 15:36:47 <glenneth>	hey talos 
Mar 12 15:36:53 <talos>	Yo glenneth
Mar 12 15:39:30 <naokotan1>	for what it's worth I should ask my prof for a letter too
Mar 12 15:40:32 <cowboy8625>	hey hey!
Mar 12 15:41:17 <Fade>	good meeting!
Mar 12 15:43:06 <cowboy8625>	how is your day?
Mar 12 15:43:30 <Fade>	I'm feeling daunted by my todo list, so everything is on track.
Mar 12 15:43:37 <Fade>	how are you, cowboy8625 
Mar 12 15:43:38 <Fade>	?
Mar 12 15:44:27 <naokotan1>	Fade: can you write my report on how to debug netowrk problems in linux? its due on the 15th and I really don't want to do it
Mar 12 15:44:47 <Fade>	of course I could, but really why would I?
Mar 12 15:44:58 <Fade>	the process of debugging all complex systems is the same. :)
Mar 12 15:45:01 <naokotan1>	You would. I send over the specs
Mar 12 15:45:14 <visl>	naokotan1: turn if off and on again. if that doesn't it's a great excuse to try a new distro 
Mar 12 15:45:17 <naokotan1>	You would and you could and you most certainly should
Mar 12 15:45:20 <Marvin2>	You would and you were planning on March daviwil?
Mar 12 15:45:54 <Fade>	I feel like you don't need my help buffing your grade in a school run by those dumb guys on that one episode of star trek tng.
Mar 12 15:46:12 <naokotan1>	turn off and on > kick > start making random chaging config files
Mar 12 15:46:34 <Fade>	1) form a theory of the machine
Mar 12 15:46:52 <naokotan1>	its less about buffing my grade adn more about trying to offload my busy work
Mar 12 15:47:01 <Fade>	2) compare what the machine is doing to what the theory says it should
Mar 12 15:47:19 <visl>	isn't that what ai is for?
Mar 12 15:47:26 <Fade>	3) goto 2, make sure you stick to the theory of the machine 
Mar 12 15:47:35 <naokotan1>	visl: I've been known to dabble
Mar 12 15:47:54 <Fade>	I think on the scale of thermodynamic entropy my hours are more valuable than yours
Mar 12 15:48:02 <Fade>	certainly they are to me. :)
Mar 12 15:48:16 <naokotan1>	yeah, that's a very subjective valuation
Mar 12 15:48:46 <Fade>	there's the objective valuation that I get more for my labour than you do...
Mar 12 15:48:48 <Marvin2>	there's the scanning machine, I has the line cliches from the perspective of using emacs for 7 years now
Mar 12 15:49:07 <cowboy8625>	sorry had to leave
Mar 12 15:49:09 <Marvin2>	sorry had to reset my phone
Mar 12 15:49:23 *	naokotan1 zips his mouth. NO I won't talk about LTV in this server
Mar 12 15:49:27 <cowboy8625>	still getting used to ussing emacs
Mar 12 15:49:29 *	Fade imagines a situation where the bot phones people up to say random things to them.
Mar 12 15:51:35 <cowboy8625>	there seems to be a lot of bots in here
Mar 12 15:52:27 <Fade>	LTV is interesting in the context of IT work
Mar 12 15:52:38 <Fade>	because people who can spend less time at a job are paid more for their work.
Mar 12 15:52:45 <naokotan1>	Its very interesting and also haram in SC channel
Mar 12 15:53:44 <Fade>	well, a big discussion about soviet post revolutionary politics is probably not conducive to our mission.
Mar 12 15:53:50 <cowboy8625>	its been a long time since ive been in irc so im haveing to remember the ol tips and tricks
Mar 12 15:54:30 <Fade>	welcome
Mar 12 15:55:07 <naokotan1>	I just don't want ot get all fired up. I tend to get all fired up and I don't even like getting all fired up
Mar 12 15:55:24 <naokotan1>	chill making databases chris is much better than fired up chris
Mar 12 15:56:22 <naokotan1>	:%s/chris/naokotani/g
Mar 12 15:56:51 <Fade>	I'm currently trying to remember the discussion yesterday about the bot
Mar 12 15:56:56 <Fade>	there were some feature requests
Mar 12 15:57:46 <cowboy8625>	i used weechat for a long time but i am trying to switch to use emacs for everything.
Mar 12 15:57:48 <Marvin2>	i used to ussing emacs
Mar 12 15:58:07 <talos>	Why use Emacs when you could use VSCode /s
Mar 12 15:58:38 <cowboy8625>	I like to be different
Mar 12 15:58:40 <Marvin2>	I like how the pdfs look when I was trying to programming efficiently, you will be a lot of experimentation and refinement and it's amazing
Mar 12 15:58:46 <naokotan1>	why use VS code when you can use gutenberg press
Mar 12 15:58:55 <cowboy8625>	I used Vim for the last 6 years
Mar 12 15:59:05 <naokotan1>	Vim OP
Mar 12 15:59:32 <talos>	But seriously I do love Emacs
Mar 12 15:59:42 <cowboy8625>	I love vim but i just want all my keybindings all the time and I think emacs can give me that.
Mar 12 16:00:23 <naokotan1>	only one way to find out! give it a spin
Mar 12 16:00:34 <cowboy8625>	I am starting to love emacs.  I need to setup the programming part a bit better but everything else is nice so far.
Mar 12 16:00:44 <talos>	I think one text editor that has recently tried to and failed at outpacing Emacs was Atom?
Mar 12 16:00:49 <cowboy8625>	I have hit it hard over the last few days.
Mar 12 16:00:50 <naokotan1>	what's you issue with the programming part?
Mar 12 16:00:52 <Marvin2>	I have it any other sequence (which is both minimal and nice bells and whistles and still couldn't get it for that!
Mar 12 16:01:23 <talos>	Marvin2 process some infinite recursion
Mar 12 16:01:40 <naokotan1>	Marvin2 eats infinite recusions for breakfast
Mar 12 16:01:48 <talos>	Heh
Mar 12 16:01:59 <cowboy8625>	well i need to get the dap debugger working for the languages i use and that is hit or miss so far but that was a pain in vim as well.
Mar 12 16:02:28 <cowboy8625>	the auto completion for the lsp is a bit laggy so i need to use lsp-booster

Mar 12 16:06:55 <naokotan1>	eyah I dont have any issues with lag
Mar 12 16:06:56 <cowboy8625>	using ERC but it doesnt auto log me in to the systemcrafters room so that is something else to look into
Mar 12 16:07:30 <cowboy8625>	trev: I found eglot way laggy with javascript. I couldnt even use it laggy.

Mar 12 19:11:48 <morganw>	cowboy8625: You can put your credentials in a .authinfo file and it can use those.  You can also gpg encrypt it (as .authinfo.gpg).

Mar 12 21:17:20 <cowboy8625>	no a problem
Mar 12 21:17:35 <cowboy8625>	i will do th too. So much to setup
Mar 12 21:17:38 <Marvin2>	i will find something eventually. The issue with similar error,
Mar 12 21:17:44 <cowboy8625>	th ** then
Mar 12 22:04:40 <cowboy8625>	so what do yall use for code competion?  I am very confused about some packages.   Seems like Ivy and Counsel do competion, but there is also completion with the lsp as well but that makes the most sense to me.
Mar 12 22:11:40 <alternateved>	cowboy8625: most likely you are looking for company
Mar 12 22:11:53 <alternateved>	or its alternative corfu and cape
Mar 12 22:27:26 <cowboy8625>	welp im back
Mar 12 22:35:00 <visl>	cowboy8625: you missed it but alternateved suggested company or corfu and cape for completion.
Mar 12 22:35:25 <alternateved>	thanks visl 
Mar 12 22:35:35 <cowboy8625>	thanks!
Mar 12 22:35:51 <alternateved>	there are other alternatives
Mar 12 22:36:19 <morganw>	cowboy8625: There is the entry point for requesting completion, the actual things which generate completions, completion styles used to choose a completion, and the completion interface which everything is presented in.  Packages give you some or all of these.  But everything is also built into plain Emacs too.
Mar 12 22:36:27 <alternateved>	but company and corfu both offer popup completion 
Mar 12 22:36:39 <cowboy8625>	i am using some one elses config right how and i am going threw it and making it my own.   They have ivy and company in use right how.
Mar 12 22:37:36 <cowboy8625>	alternateved: thank you for the info!
Mar 12 22:40:32 <alternateved>	Have a good night everyone. :)
Mar 12 22:42:03 <visl>	i switched from company to corfu/consult/vertico/marginalia when all the hip kids did as well. granted i was using company before i was using lsp.. there were extra backends to install with it.  with corfu/consult it just plugs into eglot
Mar 12 22:42:07 <Marvin2>	i switched over from RSA a few minutes to convince us all the pages are so much time for your musings about prana.
Mar 12 22:43:21 <visl>	i don't tinker with this very much (which is the feature i want) so my view of how it all works might be wrong.
Mar 12 22:43:23 <Marvin2>	i don't see a lot with me actually seeing the value in the orchestra i think. I need for the record Marvin2 is a bad idea.

Mar 13 01:35:18 <mretka>	I'm also studying machine learning now
Mar 13 01:35:29 <mretka>	And dabbled a bit with Jupyter Notebooks and MLOps
Mar 13 01:35:37 <tdback>	I've skimmed over it a few times. Ended up doing a ton with DNS at work when setting up a sendmail relay server
Mar 13 01:36:53 <mretka>	Cool
Mar 13 01:37:37 <tdback>	how's the ML stuff? Using it at work with AWS at all?
Mar 13 01:44:04 <mretka>	Not yet, I'm studying it on the side, doing some small stuff with Kaggle datasets or toy datasets
Mar 13 01:46:05 <tdback>	sounds fun
Mar 13 01:47:31 <mretka>	Yeah, I'm enjoying it, and I picked up Python again, I'm getting familiar with the syntax again and learning some more libs
Mar 13 01:55:22 <mretka>	Gotta go now, nini
Mar 13 02:31:53 <tdback>	cya!
Mar 13 03:02:48 <cowboy8625>	hey!

Mar 13 03:06:50 <benoitj>	not tonight
Mar 13 03:07:09 <benoitj>	about you?
Mar 13 03:07:16 <cowboy8625>	just working on my config
Mar 13 03:07:27 <benoitj>	I updated my nix, but still have an issue with setxkbdmap
Mar 13 03:07:30 <benoitj>	ok
Mar 13 03:07:41 <cowboy8625>	oh how is nix?
Mar 13 03:09:12 <benoitj>	quite good
Mar 13 03:09:22 <benoitj>	been on it for couple of years now
Mar 13 03:10:05 <benoitj>	it's kind of like guix, with some differences
Mar 13 03:11:50 <cowboy8625>	i think i would like it
Mar 13 03:16:32 <benoitj>	what would you like about it? curious to hear from a new perspective
Mar 13 03:17:31 <cowboy8625>	the hole reloading or rebuilding when instaling things and you can just go back it something breaks is what ive been told.
Mar 13 03:24:11 <cowboy8625>	i am trying to make the line my cursor is on a little darker then the back ground. any ideas on how to make this happen?
Mar 13 03:24:12 <benoitj>	 yeah, it has "generations"
Mar 13 03:24:50 <benoitj>	look at the "faces" I think describe-faces is what you are looking for
Mar 13 03:25:08 <cowboy8625>	ok thanks!
Mar 13 03:55:14 <cowboy8625>	yeah in vim its just `set cursorrow` 
Mar 13 03:56:52 <benoitj>	in emacs, everything visible / color, fonts, etc is a "face"
Mar 13 03:57:47 <benoitj>	the face name to change is hl-line
Mar 13 03:59:43 <benoitj>	then just M-x customize-face hl-line
Mar 13 04:17:12 <cowboy8625>	well thanks for the help! im off for the night.

Mar 13 16:54:15 <cowboy8625>	i am very new to emacs.  Started using it not even a week ago and I am not fully using it.  I am working towards using it for Programming.  I currently use vim but I think emacs will let me extend the use of vim keybindings in more programs within it.
Mar 13 16:54:44 <cowboy8625>	its been a slow go though getting all the languages set up.

Mar 13 19:01:43 <trev>	i like being the token vim user in the group
Mar 13 19:01:50 <trev>	so that is why i advocate for emacs
Mar 13 19:06:23 <alternateved>	:D

Mar 13 19:22:15 <cowboy8625>	any recommendations on database tools?

Mar 13 19:38:36 <cowboy8625>	?
Mar 13 19:39:18 <benoitj>	what tool are you looking at? mongo, redis, a RDBMS, a client to connect to these, a emacs based client, a tool to automatically version your tables, etc...
Mar 13 19:39:33 <benoitj>	that simple questions is just the trunk of a large tree
Mar 13 19:39:34 <benoitj>	:D
Mar 13 19:39:36 <Marvin2>	that simple questions is just plain text
Mar 13 19:39:40 <benoitj>	haha
Mar 13 19:39:48 <benoitj>	Marvin2: you're right as usualy
Mar 13 19:41:12 <cowboy8625>	something like tablePlus or pgcli
Mar 13 19:42:09 <benoitj>	I used to use squirrel sql
Mar 13 19:42:27 <benoitj>	but emacs also has similar clients with various degree of features
Mar 13 19:42:44 <benoitj>	I think I also used turtle in the past
Mar 13 19:43:23 <benoitj>	now I use either a web ui, or just what is in my ide
Mar 13 19:43:32 <benoitj>	no need for much more

Mar 13 20:15:19 <ozzloy>	should mu4e-view-save-url be showing me the url?  is there some other rabbit hole i should go down?
Mar 13 20:15:23 <Marvin2>	should mu4e-view-save-url be showing me the php code in it, to analyze it.
Mar 13 20:16:02 <benoitj>	ozzloy: not sure if you're new here, in all cases, Marvin2 is a bot, so dont be mad at what he's saying, he's a drunk bot

Mar 13 20:17:20 <ozzloy>	i figured Marvin2 was a bot.  i was trying to figure out how that text was generated.  is it just randomly taking some of the words and hallucinating a sentence out of it?

Mar 13 20:21:15 <benoitj>	i'm on notmuch forever

Mar 13 20:22:25 <morganw>	ozzloy: If you mu4e now uses the Gnus message viewer, you might be able to use the command shr-maybe-probe-and-copy-url.  In Gnus you just put the cursor on the link and press u.

Mar 13 20:25:36 <ozzloy>	mu4e stole C-h
Mar 13 20:25:45 <ozzloy>	(wtf, mu4e?!)
Mar 13 20:25:49 <morganw>	Use F1 instead of C-h
Mar 13 20:26:10 <morganw>	(I think technically modes are allowed to steal C-h, but they are not meant to touch F1)
Mar 13 20:26:30 <benoitj>	or M-x describe-key

Mar 13 22:08:45 <benoitj>	16:59, the list is totally different
Mar 13 22:08:54 <Fade>	I see that
Mar 13 22:09:11 <benoitj>	and was only triggered once
Mar 13 22:09:17 <Fade>	the code that manages the trigger list is ~10 years old, and I haven't really visited since it was written.
Mar 13 22:09:20 <Fade>	lol
Mar 13 22:09:25 <cowboy8625>	be back on later
Mar 13 22:09:27 <benoitj>	then I tried to trigger it with rock, and it did not work
Mar 13 22:09:51 <benoitj>	anyway, bbl
Mar 13 22:09:54 <Fade>	Emacs probably holds the key
Mar 13 22:10:02 <Fade>	!trigger
Mar 13 22:10:04 <Marvin2>	trigger:: allowed, used, amazing, guess, your, most, process, lame, guix, level
Mar 13 22:10:52 <Fade>	this is actually probably a bug, which is in a pretty surprising / amazing place.
Mar 13 22:10:55 <Marvin2>	this is why I restart the process. probably later today.
Mar 13 22:11:03 <Fade>	you shutup
Mar 13 22:11:13 <Fade>	!trigger
Mar 13 22:11:14 <Marvin2>	trigger:: allowed, used, guess, your, most, process, lame, guix, level, pretty
Mar 13 22:26:03 <mretka>	Hmmm, let's see what happens:
Mar 13 22:26:11 <mretka>	allowed used guess your most process lame guix level pretty
Mar 13 22:26:32 <mretka>	Oh, Marvin2 needs one of these maybe?
Mar 13 22:26:42 <mretka>	Used to think a lot of things
Mar 13 22:26:44 <Marvin2>	Used to sit on the left margin.
Mar 13 22:26:51 <mretka>	Yup
Mar 13 22:26:58 <mretka>	Guess that's how it's working now
Mar 13 22:27:02 <Marvin2>	Guess that's just a extra class from the premise that any data published on the scale of thermodynamic entropy my hours are more polite to him
Mar 13 22:27:19 <ozzloy>	what if you used two of them, is that allowed?
Mar 13 22:28:11 <ozzloy>	i guess not, that's kinda lame and i think you should level up to maybe even 3 of them
Mar 13 22:28:14 <Marvin2>	i guess she bought it later this year simply by being south of Jackson
Mar 13 22:29:53 <ozzloy>	huh
Mar 13 22:30:48 <mretka>	Guess the lame phrase needs to involve guix and be a process?
Mar 13 22:31:10 *	mretka is thinking of permutations of the trigger words
Mar 13 22:31:31 <mretka>	Or maybe 2 at most?
Mar 13 22:31:35 <mretka>	Guess lame things
Mar 13 22:38:54 <ozzloy>	lol, i just got a spam email with a soviet union tld https://www.85offwatch.su

Mar 13 22:48:25 <ozzloy>	so like, say i have "as|" and the cursor is where the '|' is.  then i very quickly hit "fd".  i see "asf|" then "as|"

Mar 13 23:02:00 <shom>	Hi Fade 
Mar 13 23:02:08 <shom>	You're THE crafter 
Mar 13 23:02:15 <Fade>	naokotani: you need to require for some unknown reason 'cl-lib instead of 'cl since emacs 28
Mar 13 23:02:26 <shom>	I love that Marvin quoted me back to me, I feel famous 
Mar 13 23:02:26 *	Fade is _a_ crafter
Mar 13 23:02:28 <Marvin2>	I love that one episode of star trek tng.
Mar 13 23:02:59 <Fade>	other people are much much more crafty than I am. :)
Mar 13 23:11:31 <Fade>	(or, I just won the lottery)
Mar 13 23:11:37 <Fade>	I never know what's going on.
Mar 13 23:14:03 <naokotani>	the cl thing can't be what's causing the emacs service to not launch though
Mar 13 23:14:05 <Marvin2>	the cl vs clojure debate?
Mar 13 23:14:23 <Fade>	the cl thing is just a deprecation warning.
Mar 13 23:14:50 <Fade>	the pgtk thing in conjunction with wayland is a trouble vector I don't have any experience with.
Mar 13 23:15:11 <Fade>	it's a setup that daviwil has been running for a long while, though.
Mar 13 23:15:56 <Fade>	the emacs people and the wayland people are fighting about a thing that the wayland people think is either a feature or at worst a non-issue, and the emacs people think it's a show stopper.
Mar 13 23:16:23 <Fade>	I read about it a bit the first time I saw the message on a machine, but I haven't actually run into any problem.
Mar 13 23:17:19 <Fade>	I can only conclude that not many wayland developers use emacs. :)
Mar 13 23:17:21 <Marvin2>	I can only allocate an hour ago 😀

Mar 14 07:22:41 <trevdev>	Tis like a fracture in space and time!
Mar 14 07:22:43 <Marvin2>	Tis like a playoff game.
Mar 14 07:23:20 <shom>	Here's the video trev https://youtu.be/m8C0Cq9Uv9o?si=BPEFuGPMbBCGRvow I really like how Kickstart and the video explains what's happening instead of obfuscated framework

Mar 14 07:25:15 <shom>	Hahaha benoitj I've seen it and it's great. One of the earliest videos I've seen on emacs and got me hooked. 
Mar 14 07:25:28 <trevdev>	shom: If trev wrote his Neovim as a nix flake, I'll be boggled.
Mar 14 07:26:10 <trev>	trevdev: i'm not that psychotic 
Mar 14 07:27:00 <trev>	i'm on the side of making many one character changes to my config throughout the day
Mar 14 07:27:01 <trevdev>	When I have my eventual Emacs relapse, trev, it will also be flakified, as I am sick of things randomly breaking from 3 incoherent package managers not lining up nicely
Mar 14 07:27:20 <trevdev>	I. am. PsYcHoTiC
Mar 14 07:27:34 <trev>	all you need is lazy.nvim. only break stuff when you update :P
Mar 14 07:27:36 <Marvin2>	all you diagrams. no duplication
Mar 14 07:28:14 <trevdev>	Until lazy.nvim deprecates 2 years from now
Mar 14 07:28:28 <trevdev>	(Impetus for using Nix was Packer going poof)
Mar 14 07:29:29 <trev>	very fair point
Mar 14 07:29:47 <trev>	feel the same way about neovim as a whole sometimes
Mar 14 07:29:56 <trevdev>	All I have to do is run `nix run sourcehut:~trevdev/nvim-nix` and that shit builds on any system I can get nix on, it's beautiful
Mar 14 07:30:14 <trevdev>	And it "just works"
Mar 14 07:30:35 <trev>	it bundles all the plugins?
Mar 14 07:30:48 <trev>	so it doesn't pull from their respective repos?
Mar 14 07:30:59 <trevdev>	Plugins, tree-sitters, runtime dependencies (LSPs), everything. 
Mar 14 07:31:06 <trevdev>	All pinned.
Mar 14 07:31:18 <trev>	that does sound pretty great

Mar 14 07:35:10 <trev>	why do they call them flakes? is it cause the nix logo is a snowflake? or did the logo come after?
Mar 14 07:35:43 <benoitj>	flakes came after I think. its still stable beta
Mar 14 08:44:08 <glenneth>	If I was going to install gnu guix on my laptop is there a wayland ditribution or would I install guix and then start installing wayland and hyprland or sway?

Mar 14 10:36:55 <trev>	i find that i don't really need many git commands for usual work
Mar 14 10:55:03 <naokotani>	I just what is it... squash? rebase in magit a lot
Mar 14 10:55:32 <naokotani>	becuase I will always forget to add precisely one tiny thing to a commit
Mar 14 11:05:55 <thanosapollo>	running rebase to master is something everyone you work with will love you for! 
Mar 14 11:07:04 <alternateved>	Yeaah

Mar 14 11:30:16 <naokotani>	oh I never did on command line. always did magit
Mar 14 11:30:35 <naokotani>	so git commit --amend will just add a commit to the last commit?
Mar 14 11:31:46 <cow_2001>	i always just do git rebase -i HEAD~3 or something like that
Mar 14 11:32:13 <cow_2001>	then you can choose what to do with each of the few last commits
Mar 14 11:32:15 <Marvin2>	then you would choose a completion, and the fetus got up and rampaged around eastern europe.
Mar 14 11:32:31 <cow_2001>	how gigerian

Mar 14 17:42:02 <glenneth>	I've hit that a few times.  Very handy
Mar 14 17:42:06 <naokotani>	you are on wayland right? do you use emacs daemon mode?
Mar 14 17:43:29 <glenneth>	no.  I just run emacs but I've been thinking about it and just running emacsclient
Mar 14 17:43:43 <naokotani>	ah. ive been having trouble running the server on wayland

Mar 14 17:44:39 <glenneth>	ok.  I'll give it a spin tomorrow and report back 
Mar 14 17:45:00 <naokotani>	I must have installed a package that made it work,b ut I have no idea what it was lol

Mar 14 17:46:43 <naokotani>	so many weird interactions. I realzied yesterday I didn't ahve audio and I think when installed bluez it installed pipewire-pulse or osmething. or I forgot to put something int he arch-install script

Mar 15 01:05:24 <shom>	mretka: practicing hand writing would be a good idea for me, it keeps getting worse. 
Mar 15 01:05:41 <shom>	Do you use any special pens or paper? 
Mar 15 01:14:18 <mretka>	shom: Not really, I use the most common pen ever, the blue Bic Crystal pen
Mar 15 01:15:00 <mretka>	I got 2 boxes full of Bic Crystal pens here, and used over half of one already
Mar 15 01:15:10 <mretka>	For paper I have a couple legal pads and cheap notebooks
Mar 15 01:15:35 <mretka>	Like, real cheap stuff, so that way I don't keep worrying about the paper or the pen, I just use them without thinking too much
Mar 15 01:15:37 <Marvin2>	Like, real cheap stuff, so that the trigger list is ~10 years old, and I love that song

Mar 15 02:18:53 <shom>	mretka: nice, just doing without thinking is the best because then you'll actually do it. 
Mar 15 02:20:03 <shom>	naokotani: i went to high school in Japan (international English speaking) and took Japanese as a second language. I was NOT good at writing Kanji 
Mar 15 02:20:23 <naokotani>	I wouldn't say im good. But I enjoy it

Mar 15 04:31:44 <naokotani>	aka, trying to procrastinate doing my linux assignment
Mar 15 04:32:12 <naokotani>	I wonder if I can just hand in configuring arch linux twice this week for my linux assignment and be done with it
Mar 15 04:32:29 <benoitj>	:)
Mar 15 04:32:33 <benoitj>	sounds cool
Mar 15 04:33:13 <naokotani>	its been good. I learned a lot. I think last time I messed with arch I was really not so knowledable
Mar 15 04:33:21 <naokotani>	it was really a lot of just copying and pasting code
Mar 15 04:34:52 <naokotani>	I went with Libre Baskerville headers and source sans pro body

Mar 15 04:38:49 <visl>	i do prefer a package manager these days
Mar 15 04:40:51 <benoitj>	I do too, but it was quite interesting
Mar 15 04:41:22 <benoitj>	the time when you had to learn which frequency your CRT supported, or else fry the thing
Mar 15 04:41:25 <Marvin2>	the time i looked at changing his name, but the film section is basically the Yellow stuff that gives super power?

Mar 15 04:43:29 <visl>	and trying to configure your soundcard...
Mar 15 04:43:34 <cow_2001>	naokotani: if it's chronic, and it's not just because you keep yourself up and about, and you get normal hours of sleep but without feeling rested, call a doctor

Mar 15 04:44:52 <naokotani>	I think the first time I installed linux was around 2009
Mar 15 04:44:53 <cow_2001>	because having a certain amount of good sleep is the most important thing you could ever do, like eating and drinking and breathing
Mar 15 04:45:03 <cow_2001>	benoitj: moo
Mar 15 04:45:11 <naokotani>	yeah for sure. I am quitting nights
Mar 15 04:45:21 <visl>	i noticed distros ship with pipewire these days. i think this is the 4th or 5th or attempt at getting sound to work?
Mar 15 04:45:22 <naokotani>	Been doing it for almost 4 years and im done with it
Mar 15 04:45:35 <cow_2001>	do you have earplugs and blinds?
Mar 15 04:45:52 <benoitj>	visl: pipewire is a breeze
Mar 15 04:45:57 <naokotani>	I have been pretty happy with pipewire/wirepluber/pipewire-pulse
Mar 15 04:46:12 <benoitj>	I use pipewire-pulse
Mar 15 04:46:17 <visl>	yeah. i like pipewire.. oss and alsa were bad. pulse was less bad.
Mar 15 04:46:58 <naokotani>	pipewire is not at all bad. the cli is done so well too
Mar 15 04:47:00 <cow_2001>	i must have earplugs and i shut my window when i go to sleep.  anything that blinks and bangs will be bad in bed
Mar 15 04:47:14 <visl>	i haven't installed pipewire-pulse yet. wpctl has been working well enough
Mar 15 04:47:37 <naokotani>	for whatever reason I had to install pipewire-pulse
Mar 15 04:48:01 <naokotani>	don't ask me why, but wpctl wasn't pickup up my card

Mar 15 04:48:28 <visl>	i did a few years ago and if i remember correctly it was because whatever video support in firefox didn't support native pipewire or something. 
Mar 15 04:49:18 <naokotani>	oddly enough wpctl picked up my webcam

Mar 15 04:52:05 <benoitj>	any special as a usb DAC?
Mar 15 04:52:26 <visl>	i haven't tried my dac.. probably should before i sing pw's praises
Mar 15 04:52:42 <visl>	helvum looks neat
Mar 15 04:54:27 <benoitj>	me I just have a usb sound card, the onboard card was too crappy
Mar 15 04:54:53 <benoitj>	part of it is due to some ground issues
Mar 15 04:55:53 <benoitj>	but did not spent time troubleshooting it, in practice, it could be any of the docking station, or the desktop
Mar 15 04:56:52 <visl>	i had a laptop that did that. was something weird when it was plugged into power. i ended buying a cheap ground loop filter on amazon
Mar 15 04:57:11 <benoitj>	yeah, I have a cheap ground loop on one of the dock station
Mar 15 04:57:25 <naokotani>	the usb dac I got beause my desktop case was causing huge background noise
Mar 15 04:57:35 <naokotani>	when I plugged straight into it
Mar 15 04:57:48 <benoitj>	my issue is is that I "line mix" 4 computers
Mar 15 04:58:16 <benoitj>	I usually have to kind of balance the volumes, otherwise I get noise
Mar 15 04:58:44 <naokotani>	one day id like to get an actual sound system
Mar 15 04:58:56 <naokotani>	so I can really crank out the hip hop at high volume
Mar 15 04:58:58 <Marvin2>	so I gottga play
Mar 15 04:59:03 <benoitj>	I may need a nicer line mixer

Mar 15 05:16:38 <visl>	naokotani: headphones are a gradual step up game for most. in the end i justified upgrades because in an open office environment i needed something comfortable, nice, and obvious to signal "don't walk over and start talking to me"

Mar 15 05:28:26 <benoitj>	glenneth: you had plans or you designed the amp yourself?
Mar 15 05:28:52 <glenneth>	i had to wait months for my op amps to arrive in Jordan

Mar 15 05:30:58 <benoitj>	want to build dac, we'll see
Mar 15 05:31:12 <glenneth>	they got held up at customs lol.  Mot sure what they thought i was building :)
Mar 15 05:31:28 <benoitj>	hah

Mar 15 05:40:54 <benoitj>	it does look nice. did not know that one
Mar 15 05:41:11 <benoitj>	and it's pretty affortable
Mar 15 05:42:56 <shom>	Wow checking out the navidrome demo, it's pretty cool! 
Mar 15 05:43:28 <benoitj>	it's pretty nice
Mar 15 05:44:00 <benoitj>	glenneth: oh true, I forgot I helped searching that one :D
Mar 15 05:44:02 <visl>	navidrome looks interesting but my speakers support roon's RAAT but i don't really like roon....
Mar 15 05:44:13 <glenneth>	I ditched roon for it  using the substreamer app on my mobile

Mar 15 05:47:47 <benoitj>	beautiful
Mar 15 05:48:31 <glenneth>	and remotely - substreamer on my phone.  log in to navidrome and done

Mar 15 05:48:50 <benoitj>	I should install navidrome

Mar 15 05:49:41 <glenneth>	i have a huge music collection lol.  It's working better than Roon ever did
Mar 15 05:49:49 <visl>	huh. ya navidrome is a no-go.. doesn't support any wireless streaming. :( 
Mar 15 05:50:01 <benoitj>	what do you mean?
Mar 15 05:50:06 <benoitj>	over bluetooth?
Mar 15 05:50:20 <benoitj>	or with "wifi" speakers?
Mar 15 05:50:22 <visl>	wifi like airplay
Mar 15 05:50:24 <visl>	ya
Mar 15 05:50:25 <benoitj>	ok
Mar 15 05:50:30 <visl>	roon has their own "airplay" called raat
Mar 15 05:50:57 <visl>	so i use roon to stream to devialet phantoms via raat
Mar 15 05:51:04 <benoitj>	I think is should support airplay
Mar 15 05:51:06 <visl>	they support bluetooth, but it's bluetooth
Mar 15 05:51:12 <glenneth>	ahhh ok.  I don't have any wireless speakers
Mar 15 05:51:43 <benoitj>	hmm, subsonic supports it though
Mar 15 05:52:03 <visl>	i used subsonic until they did their close source pay us thing.
Mar 15 05:52:33 <benoitj>	visl: you can use dsub on your phone connecting to navidrome and playing to your airplay device
Mar 15 05:52:46 <benoitj>	that seems to be the way to do it
Mar 15 05:52:48 <benoitj>	not ideal

Mar 15 06:04:57 <Marvin2>	looking into moving the pegs or whatever you want your project build to use libraries to deal with teams is to play maggot brain so i can't get too obsessed...but i feel like I said you used two of them, but they were in the footer of the bot self hosts its code.

Mar 15 06:09:41 <trev>	shom: just a set of keycaps i ordered for my ortholinear board (full grid). to have a spacebar that spans 2 keys you need something called a "2u POS" keycap
Mar 15 06:12:12 <shom>	Ortholinear, my man!! I use a split ortholinear Corne board with Kailh 25g purpz switches.

Mar 15 06:34:13 <trevdev>	Did you build your corne?
Mar 15 06:34:49 <trevdev>	shom: ^ oops
Mar 15 06:36:58 <trev>	moonlander is pretty neat. i like the voyager too
Mar 15 06:37:36 <trev>	there is an open source one that is basically the voyager that i'm considering building 
Mar 15 06:37:38 <Marvin2>	there is also supported
Mar 15 06:37:59 <shom>	trevdev: I assembled it but didn't solder the hot swaps, I don't have the patience for that. 
Mar 15 06:38:03 <Marvin2>	trevdev: I assembled it but never got comfortable using terminal and see what's undercover. Have at least 15 years I think he has a "DOOMSDAY" command lol 😂
Mar 15 06:38:38 <trevdev>	I really want to build one myself but I also really don't need a new hobby
Mar 15 06:39:48 <shom>	Yeah, I split the difference in being able to fully customize but not make it a hobby. I ordered a board with hot swaps soldered and installed all the components. 
Mar 15 06:40:10 <shom>	That moonlander looks really really nice but I would like to try it before shelling out for it. 
Mar 15 06:41:11 <shom>	I got the board from boardsource.xyz, good experience. 
Mar 15 06:43:14 <jakef>	i have the glove80 :) 
Mar 15 06:43:59 <jakef>	it's so good that in a moment of weakness i considered using emacs keybindings
Mar 15 06:44:05 <glenneth>	jakef: I just got the glove80
Mar 15 06:44:33 <jakef>	are you used to it now?
Mar 15 06:45:01 <glenneth>	getting there with it yeah
Mar 15 06:45:10 <trev>	daviwil wears fingerless gloves while programming scheme until 2AM
Mar 15 06:45:31 <shom>	Hahaha jakef, even with home row mods I'm still an evil user
Mar 15 06:46:39 <glenneth>	haha.  I typed up the operations manual for a power plant in Afghanistan in fingerless gloves :D
Mar 15 06:46:44 <trev>	i made all the thumb keys [space] 😳
Mar 15 06:47:51 <shom>	glenneth: and jakef do you feel like you need to "hover" your fingers and then extend to hit keys? Or does it feel pretty natural? 
Mar 15 06:47:58 <trev>	glenneth: pre-taliban government? 
Mar 15 06:48:27 <glenneth>	shom it feels pretty relaxed
Mar 15 06:48:35 <glenneth>	trev: yes
Mar 15 06:50:03 <shom>	Yeah, I'd love to try out the moonlander and glove80. I wish there was a keyboard meetup by me. 
Mar 15 06:50:20 <jakef>	shom: it's my first split keyboard, so I don't have much to compare with... a lot feels different
Mar 15 06:50:30 <shom>	Actually what I'd really like is more of a glove 40 😂 gotten used to the fewer keys 
Mar 15 06:52:00 <jakef>	i learned to touch type when i got it, so going from using 60% of digits to 100% has been the challenge 
Mar 15 06:52:02 <Marvin2>	i learned a lot, still learning
Mar 15 06:52:08 <shom>	jakef I started on the deep end of the pool with a borrowed gergoplex (12g linear) and moved up to the Corne (25g linear) 
Mar 15 06:53:31 <shom>	I also learned to touch type 100% due to the split ergo. It was a steep curve but so worth it. I still type janky on a row stagger qwerty. I can't angle my wrists in far enough to proper touch type on a laptop keyboard. 
Mar 15 06:54:37 <jakef>	oh yeah, when i go back to a normal keyboard i go back to dumb typing
Mar 15 06:56:19 <trev>	i don't touch type very well, i just like when the keyboard thocks 
Mar 15 06:56:44 <trev>	i actually want to type slower, cause that means i will do less work
Mar 15 06:58:31 <glenneth>	trev: you'll do the same amount of work.  Will just take longer :D
Mar 15 06:59:39 <shom>	Hahaha think more type less!

Mar 15 08:33:39 <Marvin2>	what's so good that in a bit~
Mar 15 08:35:35 <trev>	naokotani: lazyvim is better with the configuration. it allows you to even just take the configs and move them to your own eventually

Mar 15 14:42:30 <naokotani>	Darn. must be something specific about my setup. its proving hard to debug. IT might be something to do with my particular nvidia card

Mar 15 15:29:06 <naokotani>	mucho
Mar 15 15:30:20 <piethesailor>	Pienso que esta correcto, pero no necesita 'me'.
Mar 15 15:30:42 <naokotani>	Creo que si porque es un verbo reflexivo
Mar 15 15:30:51 <naokotani>	sea un*
Mar 15 15:30:57 <piethesailor>	no se
Mar 15 15:31:11 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 15 15:31:14 <naokotani>	I th ink its like french
Mar 15 15:31:38 <naokotani>	with some verbs being reflexive and I thought sleep was one of them, though I havne't spoken spanish is probably 10 years
Mar 15 15:32:01 <piethesailor>	I am not fluent enough to have a say in the matter
Mar 15 15:32:03 <Marvin2>	I am interested to dig more inside of it yeah
Mar 15 15:32:05 <piethesailor>	either
Mar 15 15:32:33 <piethesailor>	I think one could also make a verb reflexive in some cases
Mar 15 15:32:39 <piethesailor>	maybe..
Mar 15 15:32:56 <piethesailor>	depending on the dialect. where you are in the mundo hipanhiblantes
Mar 15 15:33:02 <naokotani>	I'd imagine, but I think some of them sort of default to it
Mar 15 15:33:21 <piethesailor>	hispanhiblantes? how do I say this 
Mar 15 15:33:33 <naokotani>	spanish speakers?
Mar 15 15:33:36 <piethesailor>	hispanohablante

Mar 15 15:34:32 <naokotani>	If its on a cereal box, I know how to say it in french otherwise im hopeless
Mar 15 15:35:16 <naokotani>	I did take French for 2 years in university though, but again this was 15 years ago
Mar 15 15:35:51 <naokotani>	also, french is too hard. spanish much easier
Mar 15 15:41:04 <benoitj>	piethesailor: bonjour! :)
Mar 15 16:07:58 <saboto>	Hey daviwil, everything ready for this months scheme course?
Mar 15 16:10:45 <daviwil>	saboto: Rendering the videos for the first session now!
Mar 15 16:12:07 <naokotani>	I have a vision of you stiring a giant cast iron pot full of boiling VHS tapes right now
Mar 15 16:12:21 <daviwil>	more like running 3 different instances of Blender at the same time
Mar 15 16:12:25 <naokotani>	but you probably mean a different kind of rendering
Mar 15 16:12:59 <naokotani>	Now I have a mental image of the mainframe at hte daviwil complex
Mar 15 16:13:40 <Fade>	it runs on retsina and olives
Mar 15 16:13:50 <daviwil>	it runs on sleep deprivation
Mar 15 16:16:22 <benoitj>	it runs on parens
Mar 15 16:16:26 <Fade>	and the inordinate power of screaming infants!
Mar 15 16:16:34 <daviwil>	speaking of which...
Mar 15 16:16:42 <benoitj>	haha
Mar 15 16:16:55 <Fade>	my computronium has been underpowered since my sprog aged out of very early childhood.
Mar 15 16:17:38 <Fade>	so... modern humans originated in the african savannah...
Mar 15 16:18:11 <Fade>	*how* did we survive the night with the chilren wailing away and the hyaenas and lions in the dark?
Mar 15 16:19:43 <Fade>	that's the question having an infant left me with at 4am with bloodshot eyes and a fraying sense of relaxation.
