Dec 11 09:15:01 <SummerEmacs>	how's the fam?
Dec 11 09:15:16 <daviwil>	slow monday here
Dec 11 09:15:34 <daviwil>	we're doing alright, mom and baby still have respiratory symptoms but doing OK despite that
Dec 11 09:15:34 <SummerEmacs>	are you ok tho? how's the baby? how's the wife and the other lil kid?
Dec 11 09:15:38 <SummerEmacs>	ooh ok

Dec 11 09:15:55 <daviwil>	slowly, yeah
Dec 11 09:15:58 <SummerEmacs>	ok
Dec 11 09:15:58 <daviwil>	we're still testing positive
Dec 11 09:16:10 <SummerEmacs>	well you will probably for another few days i imagine.
Dec 11 09:16:17 <SummerEmacs>	it can take like 2 weeks to get rid of it i think
Dec 11 09:16:22 <daviwil>	lame virus
Dec 11 09:16:34 <SummerEmacs>	yea! it sucks!
Dec 11 09:16:39 <SummerEmacs>	it shut the bloody world down!
Dec 11 09:16:42 <SummerEmacs>	it should be banned.
Dec 11 09:17:02 <SummerEmacs>	we should ban that virus legally so that it will get arrested if it ever tries anything ever again!
Dec 11 09:17:35 <SummerEmacs>	but i'm glad things are slowly improving
Dec 11 09:18:01 <SummerEmacs>	the wind on the mont saint-michel was CRAZY btw
Dec 11 09:18:03 <SummerEmacs>	like super crazy
Dec 11 09:18:10 <SummerEmacs>	like gale force winds!
Dec 11 09:18:19 <SummerEmacs>	but it was a great time
Dec 11 09:18:45 <daviwil>	kinda scary!
Dec 11 09:18:56 <SummerEmacs>	haha no it was great
Dec 11 09:19:13 <SummerEmacs>	i dunno if you know what it is lemme show you hang on

Dec 11 09:19:38 <SummerEmacs>	really really famous place
Dec 11 09:20:09 <SummerEmacs>	we also saw the Bayeux tapestry
Dec 11 09:20:12 <SummerEmacs>	which was soooo cool
Dec 11 09:20:28 <SummerEmacs>	well i've seen it all before but it was so cool to see it with my parents

Dec 11 18:21:33 <Fade>	mortadella
Dec 11 18:23:07 <piethesailor>	Okay, just restarted my machine and got sent to the login grey background, but it freezes and I get dropped into BusyBox v1.3 ubilt in shell
Dec 11 18:23:19 <piethesailor>	and the prompt is (initramfs)
Dec 11 18:23:44 <piethesailor>	help lists a number of available commands
Dec 11 18:23:52 <Fade>	now, you get to google.
Dec 11 18:23:56 <piethesailor>	indeed
Dec 11 18:24:15 <SummerEmacs>	or ping daviwil
Dec 11 18:24:35 <piethesailor>	I'll see if I can do it myself first
Dec 11 18:25:11 <Fade>	it sounds to me like guix didn't correctly configure and install the bootloader.
Dec 11 18:26:36 <Fade>	it's interesting that it works intermittently.
Dec 11 18:27:07 <piethesailor>	Fade. I guess I need to figure out the command for getting the logs here
Dec 11 18:27:28 <Fade>	if you're sitting at the initrd prompt, it didn't find the root file system.
Dec 11 18:27:34 <SummerEmacs>	getting ready to go out
Dec 11 18:28:17 <piethesailor>	I suppose initrd and initramfs are more or less the same thing
Dec 11 18:28:44 <Fade>	read the docs, my good man :)
Dec 11 18:28:50 <piethesailor>	will doo
Dec 11 18:30:27 <Fade>	this is the fun part!

Dec 11 18:35:55 <Fade>	also, Going to California and Tangerine
Dec 11 18:35:59 <SummerEmacs>	yup
Dec 11 18:37:13 <SummerEmacs>	we're supposed to have gone already but dad won't turn it off u ntil the song is over lol
Dec 11 18:37:22 <Fade>	the ringtone on my phone for my wife is "Kashmir"
Dec 11 18:37:24 <SummerEmacs>	so we're waiting 🤣 
Dec 11 18:37:31 <SummerEmacs>	haha awesome i LOVE kashmir
Dec 11 18:37:36 <Fade>	ditto :D
Dec 11 18:37:58 <Fade>	have you watched "It Might Get Loud"?
Dec 11 18:38:16 <SummerEmacs>	nope i never have but i know about it
Dec 11 18:38:22 <SummerEmacs>	i should put it on my list but you'll have to remind me later tho
Dec 11 18:38:36 <Fade>	watching Page play Kashmir for the Edge and Jack White was really something. 
Dec 11 18:38:45 <Fade>	I want one of those danelectro lipstick guitars.
Dec 11 18:38:57 <SummerEmacs>	ok it just finished!
Dec 11 18:38:59 <Fade>	I'd keep it in that tuning for just that purpose.
Dec 11 18:39:01 <SummerEmacs>	we're going i'll see you later!
Dec 11 18:39:04 <Fade>	ciao
Dec 11 18:39:06 <SummerEmacs>	🤗 
Dec 11 19:03:13 *	Fade cues up Boards of Canada
Dec 11 19:03:23 <Fade>	which is precisely the kind of asteroid music which is good for hacking
Dec 11 19:11:33 <piethesailor>	A check in, Fade, I sent exit to that shell. and I got some output:
Dec 11 19:11:48 <piethesailor>	Gaveup waiting for root file system device. Common problems
Dec 11 19:12:06 <piethesailor>	boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)
Dec 11 19:12:20 <piethesailor>	check rootdelay
Dec 11 19:12:35 <Fade>	the bootloader is looking for the root filesystem on a disk that doesn't exist since you wiped out Pop_OS
Dec 11 19:12:40 <Fade>	</guess>
Dec 11 19:12:44 <piethesailor>	and missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev
Dec 11 19:13:05 <piethesailor>	right
Dec 11 19:13:32 <piethesailor>	I also get: ALERT UUID=xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx does not exist. dropping to a shell
Dec 11 19:13:32 <Fade>	typically the solution to that is to boot the machine using the installation media, mount the actual root device, and chroot to it.
Dec 11 19:14:02 <Fade>	once you have created the chroot, you can install grub on the machine or whatever passes for grub on an efi system 
Dec 11 19:14:11 <Fade>	I'm assuming a new system76 laptop uses efi.
Dec 11 19:14:16 <piethesailor>	mine did
Dec 11 19:14:54 <Fade>	the process to do this is common, but you can look at either gentoo or arch linux documentation on how to manually mount chroot, and install the (corrected) bootloader.
Dec 11 19:15:32 <Fade>	now, there may be some guix specific suggestions which would be more expedient, but I do not know what they are.
Dec 11 19:16:51 <piethesailor>	I might enter the usb stick and run through the install process to see if there is an option for setting this up as part of the process, that I missed
Dec 11 19:17:19 <Fade>	you could try to zero the disk, by catting /dev/zero to /dev/sdX 
Dec 11 19:17:31 <Fade>	then just repartition and go again.
Dec 11 19:17:54 <Fade>	you'd have to do this from the bootable install media, obviously
Dec 11 19:18:26 <Fade>	that should kill every remaining vestige of pop_os on the machine
Dec 11 19:19:43 <daviwil>	piethesailor: You need to use `sudo` for `herd status` because Shepherd will look for a user-level instance without it
Dec 11 19:19:45 <Fade>	also any data the disk ever held
Dec 11 19:20:04 <Fade>	ah, an expert
Dec 11 19:20:09 *	Fade defers to daviwil 
Dec 11 19:20:27 <daviwil>	piethesailor: This path tells me it's looking for a user Shepherd: /run/usr/1000/shepherd/socket
Dec 11 19:25:17 <sahil_>	I am taking notes on emacs, vim+tmux sshed in 4 VMs running in qemu, compiling libreoffice-dev (full cpu utilization), and 2 monitors. Arch btw, and Guess what, it's running faster than windows ideal. :) this is life.
Dec 11 19:25:56 *	Fade listens to sahil_'s computer sizzle across the internet
Dec 11 19:48:19 <piethesailor>	Hi daviwil! I am not sure if you've read any of my isues following what you responded to. Rebooting guix after following your full guix install video, the login screen hangs as a grey screen and then falls into the BusyBox shell. 
Dec 11 19:49:01 <piethesailor>	Fade has a good point that it looks like guix is unable to find the root file system. 
Dec 11 19:49:42 <piethesailor>	And maybe that is due to (I am on a System76 Pop_os machine) pop os boot loader getting in the way here.
Dec 11 19:49:55 <daviwil>	Yeah, Guix does not use BusyBox, so that might be a clue
Dec 11 19:54:54 <Fade>	I was guessing from imperfect information
Dec 11 19:55:25 <piethesailor>	During the guix install process, is there a way to eliminate the Pop_os bootloader? I went with the clear all partitions and install guix, but obviously left behind the bootloader. I can follow Fades advice above:
Dec 11 19:55:35 <piethesailor>	 <Fade>typically the solution to that is to boot the machine using the
Dec 11 19:55:36 <piethesailor>	       installation media, mount the actual root device, and chroot to it.
Dec 11 19:55:36 <piethesailor>	<Fade> once you have created the chroot, you can install grub on the machine
Dec 11 19:55:36 <piethesailor>	       or whatever passes for grub on an efi system 
Dec 11 19:56:47 <piethesailor>	you can look at either gentoo or
Dec 11 19:56:47 <piethesailor>	       arch linux documentation on how to manually mount chroot, and install
Dec 11 19:56:47 <piethesailor>	       the (corrected) bootloader.
Dec 11 19:56:50 <Fade>	I'm kind of an old fashioned sysadmin; for all I know there's a big "Press This Big Red Button To Save Your Installation!" button on the desktop.
Dec 11 19:57:09 <Fade>	which will automagically do pretty much what I described.
Dec 11 19:57:27 <Fade>	in any event, all of my advice should be superseded by whatever daviwil thinks.
Dec 11 20:10:52 <daniel42>	hi
Dec 11 20:11:33 <daniel42>	i think i am sasled and znced now , am i?
Dec 11 20:12:22 <Fade>	did this involve a whole velvet bag full of Swarovski Crystals? :D
Dec 11 20:14:00 <daviwil>	I'm definitely salsa'd
Dec 11 20:17:47 <Kolev>	I'm tea'd. Stomach is tanned.
Dec 11 20:18:06 <daniel42>	no forgot to verify email
Dec 11 20:18:19 <daniel42>	i think now i am sasled and znced
Dec 11 20:18:57 <daviwil>	daniel42: yes, you seem to be logged in and using ZNC
Dec 11 20:19:10 <daniel42>	thx dave

Dec 11 20:20:25 <Fade>	how long is the oracle free tier free?
Dec 11 20:20:35 <daniel42>	forever

Dec 11 20:31:23 <tdback>	Pretty sure they made it available only to paying users, and it *technically* doesn't violate GPL
Dec 11 20:31:48 <Kolev>	You can get THIS copy of the code, but you can't get updates. Good luck.
Dec 11 20:31:59 <Fade>	:|
Dec 11 20:32:14 <tdback>	Yeah because isn't centos stream their upstream for testing and such?
Dec 11 20:32:18 <Kolev>	If you share the software: No updates!
Dec 11 20:42:39 <davisrichard437>	tdback: it was verified that restricting the redistribution of source code doesn't violate the GPL?
Dec 11 20:42:57 <davisrichard437>	if so that kind of sucks
Dec 11 20:43:28 <Fade>	that would be very surprising to me.
Dec 11 20:54:21 <daniel42>	“One of the things that we’ve identified is Red Hat’s [customer contract] prohibits you from distributing any of the sources or assets that you’re getting,” Kurtzer said. “It’s a difficult one, because they’re not going against the GPL, but they’re saying if you exercise your rights according to the GPL, we will drop you as a customer.”
Dec 11 20:58:02 <piethesailor>	For this guix install, I think I just need to format the partition 'fat32 boot.esp /boot/efi'. I would think that is where the Pop_os boot loader is. 
Dec 11 20:59:09 <piethesailor>	maybe keep or change the mount point to something guix understands
Dec 11 20:59:51 <piethesailor>	Or following Fade suggestion, find the required bootloader for guix and install it here, then install guix..

janv. 18 07:33:35 <SummerEmacs>	did you see this btw? https://yadm.io/#
janv. 18 07:33:38 <SummerEmacs>	looks interesting
janv. 18 07:33:42 <SummerEmacs>	instead of using stow
janv. 18 07:34:34 <SummerEmacs>	it even has an entry for managing it with magit
janv. 18 07:36:21 <cow_2001>	i just throw my dotfiles into a dotfile repository where they gather dust and additional layers of files upon additional layers of files, like some sort of an ancient archaeological digging site
janv. 18 07:37:26 <SummerEmacs>	i have a synced folder for my dotfiles but i'm wondering if i'm doing it the hard way? only, i don't really have that many dotfiles tbh. i got like 20 files in that folder at most.
janv. 18 07:37:43 <SummerEmacs>	but maybe i should be using this sytem or maybe stow? i dunno.
janv. 18 07:39:09 <cow_2001>	i'm not the one to ask.  my way is TERRIBLE.
janv. 18 07:39:47 <SummerEmacs>	hehe
janv. 18 07:39:49 <SummerEmacs>	sounds like my way
janv. 18 07:39:59 <SummerEmacs>	just symlink by hand (with dired) to a folder
janv. 18 07:40:16 <cow_2001>	been thinking of this guix home thing, but i'm too scared to use it.  what if it'll overwrite something and the world would explode?!
janv. 18 07:40:29 <SummerEmacs>	it might do some damage.
janv. 18 07:41:33 <cow_2001>	i don't even symlink.  i have the working copy and the repository copy and when i change it in the working copy until i remember i need to keep track of my stuff, so i copy it over the repository copy and commit the changes
janv. 18 07:41:45 <SummerEmacs>	there i finished refiling all the fashion stories for the day
janv. 18 07:41:56 <SummerEmacs>	oh i have a symlink in my home directory
janv. 18 07:42:11 <SummerEmacs>	and then i sync the dotfiles folder
janv. 18 07:45:12 <cow_2001>	man, i slept on my left arm, i guess, and now it's tingly
janv. 18 07:45:33 <cow_2001>	alternatively, i have fatal neurodegeneration
janv. 18 07:45:39 <SummerEmacs>	if your arm isn't back to un-tingly then you have a circulation problem
janv. 18 07:45:58 <cow_2001>	huh
janv. 18 07:46:00 <cow_2001>	rip
janv. 18 07:46:01 <SummerEmacs>	yea
janv. 18 07:46:19 <SummerEmacs>	well you can check. do a little exercise with your arm for a minute or two. the blood flow should come back normally.
janv. 18 07:46:38 <SummerEmacs>	if not, i'd go check with a doctor cuz if it doesn't come back after a little while, it might be worth looking into ok?
janv. 18 07:47:05 <cow_2001>	...
janv. 18 07:47:32 <trev>	cows need a vet sometimes
janv. 18 07:47:38 <trev>	and to graze in the pasture 
janv. 18 07:49:06 <cow_2001>	okay, the internet says i'm dead
janv. 18 07:49:22 <SummerEmacs>	yea
janv. 18 07:49:28 <SummerEmacs>	but you're not dead
janv. 18 07:49:46 <SummerEmacs>	but if you're still tingly after a few mins and even an hour later, i'd go see a doctor. really.
janv. 18 07:49:58 <SummerEmacs>	i mean it could be nothing but it could be something you might want to take care of.
janv. 18 07:51:48 <cow_2001>	huh cervical spine problems
janv. 18 07:52:14 <cow_2001>	maybe
janv. 18 07:52:17 <cow_2001>	who knows
janv. 18 07:52:25 <SummerEmacs>	it depends
janv. 18 07:52:32 <SummerEmacs>	i'd see a doctor if it's still going on tbh

janv. 18 11:58:04 <naokotani>	His moustache was OP
janv. 18 11:58:15 <naokotani>	that article is hilarious for so many reasons

janv. 18 12:35:46 <trev>	i made hot cocoa like SummerEmacs was talking about

janv. 18 12:37:21 <daviwil>	sounds pretty good
janv. 18 12:38:07 <trev>	it is pretty cozy if i ignore the fact that my eyes are burning from staring into the computer for hours like a maniac
janv. 18 12:38:21 <daviwil>	sounds like a regular day
janv. 18 12:39:45 <trev>	daviwil: ever look at scsh (scheme shell)?
janv. 18 12:40:17 <daviwil>	not really, have you?
janv. 18 12:41:11 <trev>	nah, just came across it when looking into some shell stuff. it's written in scheme48
janv. 18 12:41:33 <trev>	never heard of that one, but the idea is pretty neat and the source code has funny comments
janv. 18 12:42:57 <daviwil>	Scheme48 is cool because its bytecode interpreter is written in a Scheme dialect called PreScheme which compiles directly to native code: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_48#Implementation
janv. 18 12:43:02 <daviwil>	statically typed too
janv. 18 12:48:08 <trev>	seems cool. died cause he didn't write any docs for it lol
janv. 18 12:51:24 <trev>	i went into a rabbit hole on shells and to me the scripting part seems so messed up from a programming language perspective. i thought "scheme would probably be a better replacement" and then saw scsh
janv. 18 12:51:55 <daviwil>	shell script is pretty awful, but the benefit is that it runs on pretty much any *NIX
janv. 18 12:52:38 <daviwil>	Fennel could be pretty interesting for scripty tools though because you can generate a standalone executable from a Fennel script
janv. 18 12:52:43 <trev>	yeah until you're like me and write them using bash-isms and they don't work on BSD or dash
janv. 18 12:52:48 <daviwil>	yeah
janv. 18 12:52:50 <daviwil>	that part sucks
janv. 18 12:52:56 <daviwil>	I try to avoid Bash-specific patterns
janv. 18 12:54:03 <trev>	i was actually looking at converting some of my bash scripts into lua, but it hurts to take a nice 5 line bash script that i spent like 6 hours on and ruin it

févr. 12 15:29:07 <naokotani>	I really need to make a shell script or somethign to add sudo to the previous command
févr. 12 15:29:19 <trev>	zsh has a plugin for that
févr. 12 15:29:32 <naokotani>	about 50% of the commands I enter are the last command I wrote + sudo
févr. 12 15:30:14 <trev>	up, ctrl a and typing sudo usually is ok for me
févr. 12 15:30:30 <naokotani>	I got some end to end testing going for my website. I used puppeteer to iteratively submit form data and then mocha to assert the json data
févr. 12 15:30:44 <trev>	wow awesome
févr. 12 15:30:52 <naokotani>	I actaully found a bug. for some reason it fails for a big bad evil guys above level 18
févr. 12 15:31:11 <naokotani>	haven't looked into why. that was enough for me for a sunday
févr. 12 15:32:42 <naokotani>	man, typescript feels so janky after working with rust and needing to pull in outside libraries to do testing is kind of cursed
févr. 12 15:33:26 <alternateved>	Meanwhile bash has sudo !! 
févr. 12 15:33:30 <naokotani>	maybe janky is an exaggeration
févr. 12 15:33:42 <naokotani>	oh really?
févr. 12 15:33:48 <naokotani>	sudo !! does the last command with sudo?
févr. 12 15:33:54 <trev>	 yeah basically every programming language feels like that now for me
févr. 12 15:33:57 <alternateved>	Supposedly
févr. 12 15:34:06 <naokotani>	lets find out
févr. 12 15:34:11 <trev>	forgot about that one
févr. 12 15:34:44 <naokotani>	alternateved: you just saved me about an hour a week
févr. 12 15:34:45 <trev>	works on zsh too
févr. 12 15:34:58 <alternateved>	naokotani: haha, nice!
févr. 12 15:35:08 <naokotani>	yeah works on bash in ubuntu 22
févr. 12 15:35:20 <naokotani>	idk if its in the bashrc though
févr. 12 15:35:26 <naokotani>	or, if its something with sudo itself?
févr. 12 15:36:17 <naokotani>	Anyway, I need to take my dog snow shoeing or she's going to leave me for another owner
févr. 12 15:36:20 <naokotani>	ttyl 
févr. 12 15:36:39 <alternateved>	naokotani: it's a shell feature
févr. 12 15:36:59 <alternateved>	https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#History-Interaction
févr. 12 15:37:08 <alternateved>	History expansion
févr. 12 15:37:49 <naokotani>	I guess its not surprising that someone encountred this problem and fixed it about 40 years ago
févr. 12 15:38:24 <alternateved>	Haha, totally
févr. 12 15:38:27 <naokotani>	still, I kind of want to write a script called "sudont" that does it 
févr. 12 15:38:50 <naokotani>	no no, "sudidnt"
févr. 12 15:39:33 <naokotani>	"sushouldacouldawoulda"
févr. 12 15:39:36 <alternateved>	Just write an alias for sudo: alias please=sudo
févr. 12 15:40:29 <naokotani>	you could make it please and if there are no arguments it will add sudo to the last command
févr. 12 15:41:16 <naokotani>	which woul dbe funny because its like, you write the command, it fails and yells at you, and you just write please and it works
févr. 12 15:41:51 <naokotani>	and then alias "pretty please with sugar on top" to do the exact same thing
févr. 12 15:51:53 <alternateved>	Well, there is this: https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck

Feb 20 15:55:58 <Fade>	(did I try to debug a problem you weren't asking for help with?)
Feb 20 15:59:49 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Sorry, I'm at work and was busy ^^"
Feb 20 16:00:27 <fyrfaras`>	I just can't tell my boss to wait in line, because IRC is more important xD
Feb 20 16:00:52 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Unfortunatelly, that somebody is me x3c
Feb 20 16:02:01 <fyrfaras`>	The firewall lets everything through and keeps the state for the session. 
Feb 20 16:02:22 <fyrfaras`>	I will check the client logs of both sites.
Feb 20 16:04:59 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: And no, I'm glad and bunny grateful that you want to help me ^w^
Feb 20 16:07:47 <Fade>	http status cats: https://boingboing.net/2011/12/14/http-status-cats-by-girliemac.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+boingboing%2FiBag+(Boing+Boing)

Feb 20 16:09:36 <Fade>	http status cats: https://boingboing.net/2011/12/14/http-status-cats-by-girliemac.html
Feb 20 16:09:39 <Fade>	there :)
Feb 20 16:20:11 <Fade>	so, say you have a database of many thousands of urls, and you'd like to present them in a useful way
Feb 20 16:20:17 <Fade>	what does that look like?
Feb 20 16:34:46 <benoitj>	is girliemac related to SummerEmacs?
Feb 20 16:35:24 <Fade>	not to my knowledge. this link was recorded in 2011, when Summer would have been... 10, or 11?
Feb 20 16:35:53 <Fade>	she's precocious, but I doubt she was meming yet. :)
Feb 20 16:36:11 <benoitj>	oh
Feb 20 16:36:17 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 20 17:08:24 <dthompson>	to add to the drew saga, he's banned from lobste.rs apparently https://lobste.rs/s/vplgi1/hare_0_24_0_released_hare_s_new_release#c_dg2mzs
Feb 20 17:11:18 <Fade>	drew saga?
Feb 20 17:12:14 <Fade>	which bubble is this saga presenting upon?
Feb 20 17:18:48 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: I'm unable to check the logs on client A.
Feb 20 17:19:03 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: But the admin for this box is in the office tomorrow.
Feb 20 17:20:05 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: client B is a windows box with win 7 and the program which uses ssh is a self-built thingy by the aforementioned admin of client A.
Feb 20 17:22:03 <Fade>	there are many parts moving against each other in the scenario you have described.
Feb 20 17:22:36 <fyrfaras`>	indeed... my firewall lets everything pass.
Feb 20 17:22:44 <Fade>	it sounds to me like the firewall is closing tcp streams aggressively, maybe due to what it percieves as an absence of traffic
Feb 20 17:23:06 <Fade>	you see this kind of behaviour in old ssh daemons which relied upon a keepalive 
Feb 20 17:23:18 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: eventhough traffic is flowing?
Feb 20 17:23:24 <fyrfaras`>	Ah, yes keepalive!
Feb 20 17:23:26 <Fade>	but that wouldn't explain why the ICMP stream between the communicating hosts allows the connection to stand up.
Feb 20 17:23:45 <Fade>	ssh traffic tends to be bursty
Feb 20 17:23:55 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: the ssh version on the windows box is 7.0
Feb 20 17:24:06 <Fade>	if your firewall is doing something bizarre with ICMP traffic, you can see weird effects.
Feb 20 17:24:11 <fyrfaras`>	I don't know the version at the other side though.
Feb 20 17:24:24 <Fade>	I won't be much help with a windows stack, I'm afraid.
Feb 20 17:24:31 <fyrfaras`>	I sea.. I will check for ICMP related settings.
Feb 20 17:24:48 <Fade>	I sould whitelist ssh traffic at the firewall.
Feb 20 17:25:17 <Fade>	and then I would audit the firewall; it sounds like you don't really know what's happening there.
Feb 20 17:25:28 <Fade>	s/sould/would
Feb 20 17:32:50 <fyrfaras`>	I diving through tcpdump now.
Feb 20 17:33:09 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: ale li jo e pona
Feb 20 17:40:25 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: Everything is going well?
Feb 20 17:41:04 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: At the moment it's stable but I'm monitoring the ssh traffic with tcpdump.
Feb 20 17:42:49 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: yes
Feb 20 17:46:42 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Okay, we are getting closer!
Feb 20 17:47:06 <fyrfaras`>	I broke again and I see SYN packages towards client A.
Feb 20 17:47:16 <fyrfaras`>	s/I/it x3
Feb 20 17:47:37 <fyrfaras`>	But there aren't any SYN-ACK from client A back.
Feb 20 17:47:45 <dthompson>	Fade: re: drew saga, drew devault has come up here several times recently. has made some inflammatory remarks about emacs users, among other things.
Feb 20 17:48:11 <Fade>	all I know about him is that he's the sourcehut guy
Feb 20 17:48:27 <Fade>	I would be happy to read any linkage you happen to have.
Feb 20 17:49:14 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: I suppose client A is behaving shady. But I'm not able to take a look into that box. Hence I need to wait until tomorrow. But anybun, thank you bunny much for your advice and help :3 !!
Feb 20 17:49:36 <Fade>	I'd put a linux machine in network A and another one in network B and see if the problem persists.
Feb 20 17:49:42 <Fade>	between those two hosts.
Feb 20 17:49:51 <Fade>	or a BSD machine. whatever.
Feb 20 17:49:57 <fyrfaras`>	Good idee!
Feb 20 17:50:05 <fyrfaras`>	s/idee/idea
Feb 20 17:50:43 <Fade>	the fact that it's windows and some windows application doing ssh daemon service is a cause of some suspicion. :)
Feb 20 17:52:38 <Fade>	this arrangement indicates some deleterious thinking, even if it "should" work. 
Feb 20 17:52:50 <dthompson>	Fade: I don't have any links handy... they were shared around here some days ago
Feb 20 17:53:00 *	Fade nods
Feb 20 17:59:56 *	daniel42 nods
Feb 20 18:04:16 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Sooo, I've established another SSH connection to a different server in Net A and it works like a charm so far.
Feb 20 18:04:50 <fyrfaras`>	I'm running cmatrix(1) to get a constant output and the cmd program isn't happy about it x3
Feb 20 18:07:30 <fyrfaras`>	It looks like art combined with chaos and horrors born from the depths of of a PDP-11 long forgotten and still crunching numbers away deep deep down the lost mines of Khazad-Berkeley!
Feb 20 18:08:59 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Indeed! But it's not my machine and I'm just the firewall bunny. And I getting yelled at if some communications don't work anymore =w="
Feb 20 18:11:09 <fyrfaras`>	I suspect it's an combination of SSH versions of cosmic horrors, Windows and whatever on client A runs which is for sure as ancient as other system running around here... I mean I still need to do archives with floppies and tapes x3c
Feb 20 18:15:51 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: li pona! mi tawa li moku. mi tawa :3

Feb 20 18:18:49 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: "Fruit is sweet and good."
Feb 20 18:18:50 <cow_2001>	kilikilikili
Feb 20 18:19:02 <cow_2001>	i figgered, but wasn't sure
Feb 20 18:19:39 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: So basically "killing" means eating a lot of fruit x3 /lh
Feb 20 18:19:47 <cow_2001>	you know that sweet and sugar have shared ancestry with sukkha?
Feb 20 18:19:50 <cow_2001>	maybe not sweet
Feb 20 18:19:58 <cow_2001>	saccharine
Feb 20 18:20:14 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: What is sukkha?
Feb 20 18:20:16 <cow_2001>	fyrfaras` killing me sweetly
Feb 20 18:20:25 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: :D
Feb 20 18:20:44 <cow_2001>	i don't remember, but it's something in the Pali language
Feb 20 18:21:04 <fyrfaras`>	I need to fetch something for dinner. Be right back. Bun ya~
Feb 20 18:21:11 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: OIC :)
Feb 20 18:21:13 <cow_2001>	used somewhere in India to canonise the Buddhist writings
Feb 20 18:22:06 <cow_2001>	there's like two and two halves of continents between English and Pali, but they share origins
Feb 20 18:22:12 <cow_2001>	some origins, at least
Feb 20 18:22:22 <cow_2001>	i get goosebumps thinking about it
Feb 20 18:48:45 <daniel42>	yoga and yoke and joch have also same ancestry
Feb 20 18:49:08 <daniel42>	and also means the same
Feb 20 18:50:29 <daniel42>	The words "yoga," "yoke," and the German word "Joch" share the same Indo-European root. This root is "*yugom," which means "to join" or "to unite." This is reflected in the meaning of "yoga" as a practice of unifying the body and mind, "yoke" as a device for joining animals together to pull a load, and "Joch" in German, which also means a yoke or a beam used to connect two animals.
Feb 20 18:55:58 <daniel42>	even the word to join is,related to yoga lol
Feb 20 18:57:33 <Fade>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language
Feb 20 19:05:00 <daniel42>	would be cool if everyone could understand that.lang
Feb 20 19:15:07 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: Fascinating :3c !
Feb 20 19:15:27 <fyrfaras`>	cow_2001: Thanks for the explanation.
Feb 20 19:19:03 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: I set the old constellation up in parallel to the new and working connection.
Feb 20 19:19:37 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: client B still needs the constant ping to client A to keep up the communication
Feb 20 19:20:15 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: hence I my hypotheses is that there is a problem in client A
Feb 20 19:20:41 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Because the test connection to another server in net A is still up and bunning.
Feb 20 19:22:18 <Fade>	the fact that the icmp traffic between the hosts seems to keep the ssh connection alive made me think it was a problem in the firewall.
Feb 20 19:22:38 <Fade>	but you're on site, and if you have a workaround, seems like you're good. :)
Feb 20 19:23:30 <Fade>	but there are several unknowns, not the smallest of which is the TCP/IP stack in use on each client.
Feb 20 19:23:38 <Fade>	are these modern windows machines?
Feb 20 19:23:41 <fyrfaras`>	the firewall doesn't block anything and I cloned the original ruleset for the test connection which works totally fine
Feb 20 19:23:42 <Fade>	&etc
Feb 20 19:24:24 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Windows 7 Pro Service Pack 1
Feb 20 19:24:27 <fyrfaras`>	x3
Feb 20 19:24:33 <Fade>	if the connection between the linux machines is stable, then it's a software interaction on the troubled clients, potentially impacted by the firewall.
Feb 20 19:25:10 <fyrfaras`>	ah, the running test is between windows and a debian box
Feb 20 19:25:23 <Fade>	you do you :D
Feb 20 19:25:42 <fyrfaras`>	I can get my paws on the client A tomorrow ^^
Feb 20 19:26:03 <Fade>	if you have a workaround, I'd move on to other things.
Feb 20 19:26:05 <Fade>	:)
Feb 20 19:26:31 <fyrfaras`>	the workaround consists of an eternal ping in a background cmd xD
Feb 20 19:26:52 <Fade>	I bet it's keeping the TCP/IP stack on the windows machine woken up.
Feb 20 19:26:54 <fyrfaras`>	I will do :) time to watch Prot's dired tutorial!
Feb 20 19:27:23 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: maybe, I will let you know what I discovered tomorrow :3
Feb 20 19:27:28 <Fade>	also, perhaps the ssh connection from the openssh installation on the debian machine is doing proper keepalive.
Feb 20 19:27:35 *	Fade shrugs
Feb 20 19:27:40 <fyrfaras`>	again, thanks for the help <3
Feb 20 19:27:44 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: maybe
Feb 20 19:27:49 *	fyrfaras` shrugs too
Feb 20 19:28:06 <Fade>	I feel like the stop point is kind of unsatisfying, but at least your boss isn't haranguing you :)
Feb 20 19:28:42 <fyrfaras`>	it is but my shift is almost over and it works for the moment :)
Feb 20 19:29:57 <Fade>	w00t!
Feb 20 19:30:02 <Fade>	free agent!
Feb 20 19:30:23 <fyrfaras`>	free agent :) ?
Feb 20 19:30:30 <Fade>	yeah, you're free
Feb 20 19:30:36 <Fade>	(cue primal scream)
Feb 20 19:30:42 <fyrfaras`>	aaaah, yaaay :3 !!

Feb 20 19:35:12 <BigEatie>	Apparently it's a toss-up: God could have used Emacs or Vim to create the universe: https://0x0.st/H5zs.png
Feb 20 19:35:43 <fyrfaras`>	Heya~ BigEatie :3
Feb 20 19:35:48 <BigEatie>	Howdy
Feb 20 19:36:20 <fyrfaras`>	BigEatie: Did you bought a laser printer already?
Feb 20 19:37:19 <fyrfaras`>	Because since I'm bunning GNU Guix System recently I set up my Cups for our home printer.
Feb 20 19:37:30 <fyrfaras`>	It works like a charm and driverless.
Feb 20 19:38:00 <BigEatie>	I just bought one yesterday -- one of the Brother's on Amazon.
Feb 20 19:38:04 <BigEatie>	What are you using?
Feb 20 19:38:15 <fyrfaras`>	We have a Brother MFC-L2710DN.
Feb 20 19:38:48 <fyrfaras`>	And we set is up via ipp:// hence no printer driver needed :)
Feb 20 19:39:00 <fyrfaras`>	Even dublex works.
Feb 20 19:39:15 <BigEatie>	Go figure, bought a MFC-L2710DW
Feb 20 19:39:16 <BigEatie>	lol
Feb 20 19:39:36 <fyrfaras`>	I think the only difference is that your model has wifi :)
Feb 20 19:40:07 <fyrfaras`>	So there is a got chance to get it up and bunning with GNU Guix System.
Feb 20 19:40:24 <fyrfaras`>	And we can tech support each other soon :D
Feb 20 19:40:29 <BigEatie>	Pretty cool, haha
Feb 20 19:40:56 <BigEatie>	Haven't made the jump go Guix, but maybe one day -- nice that it works out of the box without any drivers necessary though
Feb 20 19:42:20 <fyrfaras`>	Before this I never knew one could run a printer driverless. We'd had some trouble with the Brother drivers, hence the stumble over this neat solution.
Feb 20 19:56:28 <fyrfaras`>	Time to bun home! Sea ya later around the chronostream :3 !
Feb 20 19:56:34 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: mi tawa

Feb 20 21:03:23 <phoxfyre>	Hello, how are yall today?
Feb 20 21:08:53 <benoitj>	hi phoxfyre 
Feb 20 21:09:21 <benoitj>	busy working for me. another 2 hours and will go to my 2nd shift
Feb 20 21:16:16 <benoitj>	about you phoxfyre?
Feb 20 21:16:49 <phoxfyre>	I am doing well, just relaxing after a long few weeks of assignments.
Feb 20 21:17:01 <benoitj>	nice
Feb 20 21:28:08 <SummerEmacs>	BigEatie: God would have used Vim. Emacs is for those of us who don't need a god to create universes of our own.
Feb 20 21:28:39 <SummerEmacs>	and hi everyone 👋 i just got back
Feb 20 21:29:41 <SummerEmacs>	benoitj: i hope you saw that as well. 😀 
Feb 20 21:29:41 <phoxfyre>	Hello Summer
Feb 20 21:29:43 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi
Feb 20 21:29:47 <phoxfyre>	How are ya?
Feb 20 21:29:57 <SummerEmacs>	feeling divine. and you? 😀 
Feb 20 21:30:00 <SummerEmacs>	i just got back
Feb 20 21:30:03 <SummerEmacs>	from the airport
Feb 20 21:30:11 <SummerEmacs>	well we got back like 30 mins ago
Feb 20 21:30:22 <benoitj>	SummerEmacs: hey!
Feb 20 21:30:31 <SummerEmacs>	benoitj: hihi
Feb 20 21:30:33 <SummerEmacs>	did you see my answer?
Feb 20 21:30:44 <benoitj>	about god and emacs?
Feb 20 21:30:46 <SummerEmacs>	yea
Feb 20 21:30:49 <benoitj>	yeah :)
Feb 20 21:31:09 <SummerEmacs>	i think that's a 🎤🫳🏻 moment
Feb 20 21:32:30 <SummerEmacs>	hi Fade 👋 daviwil fyrfaras
Feb 20 21:35:02 <alternateved>	Hi SummerEmacs
Feb 20 21:35:47 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi
Feb 20 21:36:22 <SummerEmacs>	i just got in
Feb 20 21:38:00 <fyrfaras>	Heya~ SummerEmacs :3
Feb 20 21:38:25 <fyrfaras>	Glad you are back uwu
Feb 20 21:38:53 <Fade>	Summer!
Feb 20 21:39:33 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi
Feb 20 21:39:37 <SummerEmacs>	look up a bit
Feb 20 21:39:42 <SummerEmacs>	i answered bigeatie
Feb 20 21:39:59 <Fade>	I see that
Feb 20 21:40:49 <SummerEmacs>	hehe
Feb 20 21:40:57 <SummerEmacs>	i had a lil to drink on the flight
Feb 20 21:41:04 <SummerEmacs>	free champagne so...i said yes
Feb 20 21:41:09 <Fade>	:D
Feb 20 21:41:10 <SummerEmacs>	what's up with you guys?
Feb 20 21:41:22 <Fade>	I've been bug hunting
Feb 20 21:41:34 <SummerEmacs>	i've been emailing prot from the plane half the time. i've been redoing my config completely
Feb 20 21:41:46 <benoitj>	me just working
Feb 20 21:41:49 <SummerEmacs>	he gave me some key points about it i'm gonna implement slowly tomorrow.
Feb 20 21:41:56 <Fade>	I started doing that, then I got busy with other stuff so I didn't finish.
Feb 20 21:42:44 <SummerEmacs>	i started redoing my entire file structure as well
Feb 20 21:42:52 <SummerEmacs>	it's going hand in hand with my total makeover thing i'm doing
Feb 20 21:43:08 <alternateved>	I've rewritten a part of my config to
Feb 20 21:43:08 <Fade>	very systemcrafter :)
Feb 20 21:43:36 <alternateved>	Decided to throw away my poor man's paredit for everything and instead incorporated puni
Feb 20 21:43:39 <SummerEmacs>	yea all mac based but yea
Feb 20 21:44:09 <SummerEmacs>	i'm doing a split buffer and then copy/pasting blocks to the other side to document each section clearly for myself.
Feb 20 21:44:10 <jlicht>	what's puni? 
Feb 20 21:44:15 <alternateved>	Apparently puni doesn't have to be used as a mode, I can just pick commands that works for me
Feb 20 21:44:29 <Fade>	I love paredit
Feb 20 21:44:31 <SummerEmacs>	and evaling with the tangle code so it'll make .el files for each block and won't run on an .org literate file anymore.
Feb 20 21:44:42 <alternateved>	smartparens but lighter and for every language (maybe): https://github.com/AmaiKinono/puni
Feb 20 21:45:07 <Fade>	SummerEmacs: I like that change. it's what lead me to start a new config.
Feb 20 21:45:11 <Fade>	I need to get back to it.
Feb 20 21:45:16 <SummerEmacs>	yea.
Feb 20 21:45:26 <SummerEmacs>	it'll take me a while, i'm still super busy. really really really busy
Feb 20 21:45:33 <SummerEmacs>	but i'm getting it done a little bit each day
Feb 20 21:45:39 <Fade>	nice
Feb 20 21:45:39 <cow_2001>	puni puni puemi
Feb 20 21:45:41 <SummerEmacs>	i figure it'll take me about a week or two maybe.
Feb 20 21:45:45 <SummerEmacs>	hihi 🐮 
Feb 20 21:45:49 <cow_2001>	hellooooo
Feb 20 21:46:27 <alternateved>	hi cow_2001 
Feb 20 21:47:31 <cow_2001>	i'm still stuck with paredit
Feb 20 21:47:54 <Fade>	stuck?
Feb 20 21:48:01 <alternateved>	I prefer to be explicit about removing things
Feb 20 21:48:06 <fyrfaras>	Fade helped me to tackle a strange network problem at work :3
Feb 20 21:48:07 <cow_2001>	iuno, seems like there are other stuff
Feb 20 21:48:15 <alternateved>	paredit changed editing too much for my taste
Feb 20 21:48:44 <Fade>	paredit is about structural editing, and mostly makes sense in lisp code.
Feb 20 21:48:58 <Fade>	if you aren't writing lisp code, you probably shouldn't be using paredit.
Feb 20 21:49:07 <Fade>	 /imo
Feb 20 21:49:12 <alternateved>	I'm talking about lisp code 
Feb 20 21:49:29 <Fade>	I can't really deal without paredit mode at this point when I'm writing lisp.
Feb 20 21:49:51 <alternateved>	I prefer to use explicit commands to do stuff
Feb 20 21:50:02 <Fade>	I'm not sure what you mean
Feb 20 21:50:18 <alternateved>	If I want to kill line, kill it always. If I want to kill line till the end of sexp, then I have a binding for that
Feb 20 21:51:00 <Fade>	at this point I think about editing lisp in paredit terms
Feb 20 21:51:06 <SummerEmacs>	i'm going over the next set of travel plans
Feb 20 21:51:14 <alternateved>	That provides me a bit more unified setup for lisp and for other languages where parentheses also exist
Feb 20 21:51:16 <SummerEmacs>	i won't be here friday again i'm gonna be traveling.
Feb 20 21:51:33 <Fade>	zoom zoom
Feb 20 21:51:41 <SummerEmacs>	yea
Feb 20 21:52:25 <nm0i>	I've even stuck paredit-like mode into other modes and zsh, it saves time.
Feb 20 21:53:27 <Fade>	paredit's focus is on whole lisp forms, and while I guess you could use it as a kind of electric-pair mode for js and python and C and whatnot... I don't think it'd work well there.
Feb 20 21:53:30 <fyrfaras>	SummerEmacs: Save travels :3
Feb 20 21:53:42 <SummerEmacs>	fyrfaras: ty! i'm not going yet tho. i just got home.
Feb 20 21:53:46 <SummerEmacs>	like an hour ago now i guess
Feb 20 21:55:17 <fyrfaras>	SummerEmacs: OIC, then this bunny wish will activate on your next journey automatically ;3
Feb 20 21:55:26 <SummerEmacs>	hehe ty
Feb 20 21:55:28 <cow_2001>	Fade: me too :|
Feb 20 21:55:34 <alternateved>	Fade: that's why I use puni
Feb 20 21:56:05 <cow_2001>	oh, puni puni poemy is a 2001 comedy cartoon
Feb 20 21:56:45 <cow_2001>	lambasting its director's(?) earlier work excel saga
Feb 20 21:57:00 <fyrfaras>	SummerEmacs: I'd watched Prot's intro video of Denote. I'm totally hooked and I think Prot is a adorable and lovely bun uwu
Feb 20 21:57:17 <SummerEmacs>	i told ya
Feb 20 21:57:26 <cow_2001>	you should donate to denote's developer
Feb 20 21:57:44 <SummerEmacs>	his video is what convinced me that not only denote is the way, but his way of doing emacs is the way. it also taught me to use dired and i use that ALL the time now, also with tramp (which is amazing).
Feb 20 21:57:45 <cow_2001>	just because of the pun
Feb 20 21:58:14 <SummerEmacs>	we've been emailing back and forth the last few days on my new setup
Feb 20 21:58:15 <alternateved>	What is his way of doing Emacs, Summer?
Feb 20 21:58:19 <fyrfaras>	cow_2001: puni-puni is the sound one makes while doing cute puns ;3
Feb 20 21:58:27 <SummerEmacs>	alternateved: if you have to ask, you can't afford it.
Feb 20 21:58:38 <alternateved>	lol
Feb 20 21:58:45 <SummerEmacs>	🙃 
Feb 20 21:58:52 <SummerEmacs>	i told you i had a few glasses of champagne on the plane
Feb 20 21:59:02 <cow_2001>	fyrfaras: my puns are all turgid and stale
Feb 20 21:59:21 <Fade>	turgid miscreant!
Feb 20 21:59:46 <cow_2001>	fyrfaras: like a torn turgid tree trunk after a storm
Feb 20 21:59:48 <fyrfaras>	cow_2001: Still they are lovely in their own way :3
Feb 20 21:59:59 <SummerEmacs>	lol
Feb 20 22:00:18 <cow_2001>	after typhoon.  i blew it
Feb 20 22:00:22 *	Fade sends cow off to stand in the corner
Feb 20 22:01:29 <fyrfaras>	SummerEmacs: Today I started to watch Prot's latest Dired video and I'm looking bunny forward to watch it further ^w^
Feb 20 22:01:45 <Fade>	oh, we're bunning againg
Feb 20 22:01:46 *	cow_2001 dons the pointy dunce hat
Feb 20 22:02:08 <fyrfaras>	Fade: Yesh(1) UwU
Feb 20 22:02:22 <naokotani>	today is trait day. it's like leg day for rust noobs
Feb 20 22:04:01 <SummerEmacs>	fyrfaras: watch his latest video about consult etc....
Feb 20 22:04:03 <SummerEmacs>	it's totally awesome
Feb 20 22:04:19 <naokotani>	off the hook even?
Feb 20 22:04:20 <SummerEmacs>	i've been using all of those tools for a long time now but he showed me stuff i didn't know about or use.
Feb 20 22:05:07 <fyrfaras>	Need to hop into my burrow soon owo
Feb 20 22:06:05 <fyrfaras>	SummerEmacs: That's bunsome and I will do that :3
Feb 20 22:06:05 <SummerEmacs>	i'm gonna shower in like 20 or so mins or maybe 30 mins and then get on my bed
Feb 20 22:07:54 <naokotani>	my dog just walked over with her llamacorn and dropped it at my feet so I threw it for her and she just looked at me like "Why? Why you throw?"
Feb 20 22:09:36 <BigEatie>	Dammit, accidentally exited out of the chatroom
Feb 20 22:09:49 <BigEatie>	Lost all the messages I was about to catch up on
Feb 20 22:10:01 <BigEatie>	Is there a log of this place anywhere?
Feb 20 22:10:53 <trev>	don't think so
Feb 20 22:21:11 <SummerEmacs>	BigEatie: i saved it for you
Feb 20 22:21:35 <SummerEmacs>	BigEatie: i replied to you the following:
Feb 20 22:21:44 <SummerEmacs>	BigEatie: God would have used Vim. Emacs is for those of us who
Feb 20 22:21:44 <SummerEmacs>		      don't need a god to create universes of our own. [21:28]
Feb 20 22:25:42 <BigEatie>	lol love it
Feb 20 22:26:05 <BigEatie>	Wait...I feel like this is one of those self-reference paradoxes.
Feb 20 22:28:01 <SummerEmacs>	😀 
Feb 20 22:28:07 <Fade>	ironically, during the first days of the lisp machine, the memory image in the machine was called "The Universe"
Feb 20 22:28:17 <SummerEmacs>	BigEatie: what's the link to your poll?
Feb 20 22:28:22 <SummerEmacs>	i tried to find it but i couldn't
Feb 20 22:28:54 <SummerEmacs>	Fade: the story fits. 😀 
Feb 20 22:29:27 <BigEatie>	https://fosstodon.org/deck/@BigEatie/111956632575839949
Feb 20 22:29:39 <fyrfaras>	I will now go to sleep. Nini~ everybunny :3 !
Feb 20 22:30:32 <BigEatie>	One of the best things that came out of that thread was someone linking this to me -- I'd never seen it before: https://fosstodon.org/deck/@BigEatie/111956632575839949
Feb 20 22:33:22 <SummerEmacs>	there i answered it
Feb 20 22:34:05 <BigEatie>	Benoitj: LMAO @ black holes being highly efficient garbage collectors
Feb 20 22:35:55 <BigEatie>	Anyone remember this logo: https://0x0.st/H5-8.png
Feb 20 22:36:20 <Fade>	I remember it being on my underwear when I was about ten years old.
Feb 20 22:36:23 <BigEatie>	Reddit is telling me the cornucopia never existed
Feb 20 22:36:48 <BigEatie>	Apparently that's FTL's official stance.
Feb 20 22:36:49 <Fade>	mandella freaks are trying to zero-day your brain meat.
Feb 20 22:37:14 <BigEatie>	That's a sentence I never hoped to hear lmao
Feb 20 22:37:36 <BigEatie>	And also reminds me of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6JFTmQCFHg
Feb 20 22:39:10 <benoitj>	I still have couple of tshirt with that logo
Feb 20 22:39:27 <BigEatie>	Please post proof.
Feb 20 22:39:29 <SummerEmacs>	they still make tshirts
Feb 20 22:39:43 <SummerEmacs>	they're still in business. they're just a subsidiary now.
Feb 20 22:39:46 <SummerEmacs>	i just looked it up
Feb 20 22:39:59 <SummerEmacs>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_Loom
Feb 20 22:40:03 <BigEatie>	FTL still exists, but they say the cornucopia never existed,
Feb 20 22:40:19 <BigEatie>	See, on the wikipedia page, the corncuopia is missing
Feb 20 22:40:56 <BigEatie>	From the wikipedia page: The company's logo comprises a red apple, leaves, green grapes, purple grapes, and white currants (or yellow gooseberries),[3][unreliable source?] but not a cornucopia. In July 2023, a Snopes reporter said that a search of newspaper advertisements between the 1920s and 2020s revealed none that depicted a cornucopia — this is often cited as an example of the Mandela Effect.[4]
Feb 20 22:40:56 <SummerEmacs>	yea and see what it says in the first paragraph
Feb 20 22:40:58 <benoitj>	BigEatie: yeah, that bing was quite funny
Feb 20 22:40:59 <SummerEmacs>	it never existed
Feb 20 22:43:23 <SummerEmacs>	the whole "mandela effect" is another pinnacle of stupid.
Feb 20 22:44:25 <SummerEmacs>	it's a perfect global demonstration about how a huge segment of people refuse to believe they have ever actually been wrong, or their memory is flawed.
Feb 20 22:44:55 <BigEatie>	It's just...bizarre. Some things which people collectively remember. Like an artist drew that picture, but it's exactly how I remembered it.
Feb 20 22:45:37 <BigEatie>	Like, I remember that firsthand.
Feb 20 22:46:41 <SummerEmacs>	yea but that just shows you how fallible people's perceptions and memories are.
Feb 20 22:47:24 <SummerEmacs>	here's from the wikipedia page of the "Mandela Effect": This phenomenon was dubbed the "Mandela effect" by paranormal researcher Fiona Broome, 
Feb 20 22:47:38 <SummerEmacs>	no one who has a title of "paranormal researcher" should ever be taken seriously. 🤣 
Feb 20 22:48:49 <SummerEmacs>	it's a bit like as if i went around saying that my job title was "atlantis archaeologist" 😀 
Feb 20 22:49:24 <BigEatie>	The fact that it's taken seriously by idiotic people doesn't in and of itself make it idiotic though 
Feb 20 22:50:10 <BigEatie>	I mean, I agree about the other stuff. My little kid brain thought of it as Berenstein, no big deal. I conflated some of Sinbad's work with Shaq's, I'm fine with that too. But, the cornucopia -- the fact that so many folks remember it that way, the fact that I myself remember it exactly how the artist drew it, that strains credulity in a way the others dont.
Feb 20 22:50:14 <SummerEmacs>	it does to me. it means it's a likelyhood of nearly 100% that it's idiotic and has nothing to do with "alternative realities" 
Feb 20 22:50:42 <BigEatie>	Oh, the whole alternative reality thing is dumb, I only remember reading about that vaguely.
Feb 20 22:50:49 <SummerEmacs>	no, you just misremembered like so many others. and that's fine because we all misremember every single day.
Feb 20 22:50:59 <SummerEmacs>	well that's the claim of the "mandela effect"
Feb 20 22:51:04 <SummerEmacs>	that it's "alternative realities"
Feb 20 22:51:08 <SummerEmacs>	that we're moving through them
Feb 20 22:51:13 <SummerEmacs>	it's completely bonkers
Feb 20 22:51:56 <SummerEmacs>	but what *isn't* completely bonkers is that i need a shower now before i get on my bed so imma go do that now. 🙃 👋 
Feb 20 22:53:14 <BigEatie>	If it is collective misremembrance, that's a pretty cool phenomenon in and of itself. It's such a weird detail to inject into an image.   
Feb 20 23:23:48 *	Fade yawns
Feb 20 23:30:31 <Fade>	I recognized the logo, in the vaguest terms possible, as belonging to the underwear company from childhood.
Feb 20 23:30:51 <Fade>	the cornucopia didn't seem out of place, so I assumed it was part of the actual logo.
Feb 20 23:32:20 <Fade>	the mandella effect is a kind of internet enabled hallucination.
Feb 20 23:33:38 <BigEatie>	See, in the back of my mind I always thought they changed the logo, but (I feel like) the cornucopia always stuck out to me in childhood cause I had no idea what it was
Feb 20 23:34:25 <Fade>	I see discussion of this has entered the wikipedia article.
Feb 20 23:39:08 <cow_2001>	i've recently learned of "fruit of the loom" from Rifftrax
Feb 20 23:39:30 <cow_2001>	trying to figure out what logo are you talking about
Feb 20 23:39:40 <cow_2001>	oh, bigeatie's question
Feb 20 23:40:14 <cow_2001>	brightly coloured single shade shirts and pants
Feb 20 23:48:49 <Fade>	they make t-shirts and underwear and socks
Feb 20 23:52:39 <cow_2001>	evocative name
Feb 20 23:53:18 <Fade>	the entire corporation was bought by Berkshire Hathaway in the early noughts
Feb 20 23:53:18 <Kingsy>	anyone around? looking for some guix advice
Feb 20 23:53:30 <Fade>	and now I know more about Fruit of the Loom than I ever needed to know.
Feb 20 23:57:17 <Fade>	Kingsy: ask and you may receive an answer
Feb 20 23:57:29 <Fade>	IRC is asyncronous. :)
Feb 20 23:57:55 <Kingsy>	if I am just using base-packages and xorg-server what else do I need to properly run gtk, qt etc etc apps? gsettings seem to be missing for one
Feb 20 23:59:06 <Fade>	have you tried installing it?
Feb 20 23:59:29 <Fade>	I don't use guix as a distribution, only a package manager, so I'm afraid I don't have much advice.
Feb 21 00:00:39 <Kingsy>	yeah but it just raises more questions, do I need dconf for example instead. or both.
Feb 21 00:05:57 <Kingsy>	Settings schema 'org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser' is not installed <- for example
Feb 21 00:06:35 <Kingsy>	this is after install gsettings and dconf. so it just makes me think there culd be a huge list of items I am missing. the guix documentation is TERRIBLE :D

Feb 21 01:05:55 <Kingsy>	Fade: if you have used the package manager perhaps you canhelp with this one, which package contains the binary "dbus-run-session" ?
Feb 21 01:09:49 <Kingsy>	ah nm
Feb 21 01:33:11 <tdback>	hey crafters!
Feb 21 02:38:13 <benoitj>	tdback: hey
Feb 21 02:51:09 <nyovella>	Good (late) evening, this time from the comfy laptop, rather than desktop
Feb 21 03:06:21 <talos>	Yo
Feb 21 03:14:41 <benoitj>	hi talos 
Feb 21 03:14:46 <benoitj>	hey nyovella 
Feb 21 03:15:16 <talos>	Yo Benoitj
Feb 21 03:16:35 <talos>	Today I realized I need a backup server for zfs snapshots, but that might take a bit to get for me lol, just gotta save monies 
Feb 21 03:16:53 <benoitj>	talos: making progress in my nix flake setup. I'm done with the OS part for my laptop (milhouse): https://git.sr.ht/~benoit/dotfiles/tree/main/flake.nix#L1
Feb 21 03:17:47 <benoitj>	great about your zfs backup. I think mine is an old i3 1st or 2nd gen
Feb 21 03:18:14 <benoitj>	probably one of my 15 years old desktop, or maybe my father's old desktop
Feb 21 03:18:36 <talos>	Cool!
Feb 21 03:19:55 <cow_2001>	do you all seed to 2.0?
Feb 21 03:27:23 <benoitj>	cow_2001: ?
Feb 21 03:28:01 <cow_2001>	ratio 2.0
Feb 21 03:33:09 <benoitj>	I guess I missed something. totally no clue what you are talking about
Feb 21 03:33:13 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 21 03:34:03 <talos>	Same 
Feb 21 03:35:03 <cow_2001>	you know, when torrenting gnu plus linux distributions ;p
Feb 21 03:36:47 <benoitj>	oh, I dont torrent
Feb 21 03:37:11 <benoitj>	I only use it when I want to download a linux iso. with 50 connections :P
Feb 21 03:37:46 <cow_2001>	>_>
Feb 21 03:37:50 <talos>	Right now I run a server on hetzner, but I'm dissatisfied with it for 3 reasons- it runs WordPress and I dislike WordPress because of how big and complex it is, but it is simple to use. The server uses the btrfs filesystem underneath it all, I want to use zfs nowadays. And finally since it runs nixos I didn't give it enough boot space when
Feb 21 03:37:50 <talos>	rebuilding, so now like every 3rd rebuild I have to delete old systems 
Feb 21 03:39:44 <talos>	But nixos makes it "easy" to reproduce a system somewhat, so I could do that, I just remember the nightmare of dns stuff lol
Feb 21 03:40:08 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 21 03:40:38 <benoitj>	I used to have a linode, and ovh vps, but now i just self host everything
Feb 21 03:40:56 <talos>	I can see why haha
Feb 21 03:41:16 <benoitj>	I'm redoing my setup for my "services" servers with nixos instead of docker 
Feb 21 03:41:49 <talos>	Makes sense 
Feb 21 03:42:48 <benoitj>	talos: I started looking at colmena for remote deployment of my nix servers
Feb 21 03:42:49 <talos>	The only thing I run in docker currently is an irc server 
Feb 21 03:42:57 <benoitj>	do you use that or deploy-rs?
Feb 21 03:43:00 <benoitj>	ok
Feb 21 03:43:51 <talos>	Never heard of colmena 
Feb 21 03:48:19 <benoitj>	colmena allows to deploy the nixos flake using ssh
Feb 21 03:48:52 <talos>	Nice 
Feb 21 03:49:00 <talos>	I will look into it 
Feb 21 03:49:11 <talos>	Thanks for the suggestion 
Feb 21 03:49:37 <benoitj>	deploy-rs does the same
Feb 21 03:49:50 <talos>	Ahhh
Feb 21 03:49:52 <benoitj>	still finding which one is best
Feb 21 03:50:21 <talos>	If you don't mind me prodding, how do you self host your stuff 
Feb 21 03:52:25 <benoitj>	I dont mind :), beside my NAS, I have a xcp-ng node running on a dual xeon cpu, 128 gig ram. this allows me to run VMs. Right now I run two docker swarm with distributed filesystem. I like it but it's too complex. 
Feb 21 03:52:48 <benoitj>	going to keep xcp-ng with xen orchestra for the VMs, but just deploy nixos VMs
Feb 21 03:53:26 <benoitj>	for my network, I have multiple vlan, to split my network and prevent stuff that is public from seeing stuff on my intranet
Feb 21 03:56:05 <talos>	 Ooh
Feb 21 03:56:44 <talos>	How do you put stuff out onto the net itself? A proxy or something?
Feb 21 03:58:40 <benoitj>	yeah, I run ssl proxy called traefik
Feb 21 03:58:50 <talos>	Cool
Feb 21 03:59:02 <talos>	I've heard of traefik 
Feb 21 03:59:09 <talos>	Never tried it tho
Feb 21 04:00:22 <benoitj>	it also integrate with letsencrypt and my DNS host to do DNS-01 proof to get a "star" certificate
Feb 21 04:04:15 <talos>	Cool
Feb 21 04:04:43 <talos>	I will follow in your footsteps probably to save monies and have more control lol 
Feb 21 04:07:34 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 21 04:07:48 <benoitj>	my last server was built with a lot of used data center parts
Feb 21 04:10:06 <talos>	Sweet 
Feb 21 04:10:24 <talos>	I love learning things from others over irc haha
Feb 21 04:11:48 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 21 04:16:33 <talos>	Doing like 2 things at once on my phone so that's why I'm not responding so soon 
Feb 21 04:43:20 <benoitj>	oh, dont worry, doing the same. playing dayz with my daughter
Feb 21 04:53:27 <benoitj>	talos: to give some ideas of how the server was built: x8dt3 motherboard, two xeon L5640 processors (similar to 6 cores i7) giving me 24 logical CPUs, 8x16gig ram
Feb 21 04:53:48 <benoitj>	the L in the cpu model means low power
Feb 21 06:18:02 <glenneth>	Morning Folx :)
Feb 21 06:21:16 <benoitj>	hey glenneth 
Feb 21 06:21:17 <benoitj>	morning
Feb 21 06:21:44 <glenneth>	HEy benoitj o/  How are you doing?
Feb 21 06:26:08 <benoitj>	doing fine. soon going to sleep. about you?
Feb 21 06:26:55 <glenneth>	I'm doing OK thanks :) busy at the minute. All good though
Feb 21 06:31:29 <cow_2001>	i don't know what i'm doing
Feb 21 06:35:42 <cow_2001>	i have a guix package definition that does not work and i am out of my depth
Feb 21 06:37:05 <cow_2001>	if i go around like a crazyperson shoving it in people faces saying it doesn't work, i don't think i'm going to get much help
Feb 21 06:38:29 <glenneth>	Hey cow_2001 You're not the only one that doesn't know what they are doing :)
Feb 21 06:41:45 <cow_2001>	i don't even know what i don't know
Feb 21 06:42:42 <cow_2001>	if you try to guix -L . guile-cv-0.4, it fails on locating libvigra_c https://codeberg.org/kakafarm/guix-kakafarm-channel/src/branch/guile-for-guile-cv/kakafarm/packages/guile-xyz.scm#L109
Feb 21 06:42:51 <cow_2001>	how do you even make it aware of it?
Feb 21 06:43:12 <cow_2001>	it is something to do with LD_LIBRARY_PATH or somesuch
Feb 21 07:39:32 <benoitj>	cow_2001: in your inputs usually
Feb 21 07:57:34 <fyrfaras>	Good meowning :3
Feb 21 07:59:41 <fyrfaras>	Kingsy: Are you still here? Yesterday I set my GNU Guix System at work up for GNOME. Hence I could check for gsettings. IIRC I just installed gnome-tweaks to get to certain settings.
Feb 21 08:01:51 <fyrfaras>	Kingsy: Also if you run a desktop you should use %desktop-services instead of %base-services.
Feb 21 08:03:28 <fyrfaras>	BigEatie: I own a lot of band t-shirts by FTL and even my oldest from 2013 doesn't have the horn of plenty in it.
Feb 21 08:04:07 <fyrfaras>	Else they would call themself Fruit of the Horn, right :D ?
Feb 21 08:20:47 <glenneth>	Hey fyrfaras o/
Feb 21 08:23:51 <BigEatie>	Yea, the time I recall it was probably the 90sish, but who knows.
Feb 21 08:26:22 <BigEatie>	I'm totally willing to accept I have it wrong. Nevertheless I think it's a fascinating phenomenon. Take something you have a clear memory of, and try and convince yourself it's not real. Even though you know the mind is fallible, it's difficult to do. Now add to that the fact that a large number of people remember it as well. I can still accept that it's likely false given the mountain of evidence against it, but it still demands some
Feb 21 08:26:22 <BigEatie>	kind of explanation. Were there knockoffs going around with cornucopias? Something else? Who knows.
Feb 21 08:26:49 <BigEatie>	Is it some kind of collective hallucination?
Feb 21 08:37:02 <trev>	BigEatie: look at their 1978-2003 logo, it was much harder to tell what the leaves and stuff are
Feb 21 08:37:29 <trev>	also that underwear sucked. hanes was better, but i always had fruit of the loom cause it was cheap at walmart lol
Feb 21 10:06:28 <port19>	I installed nonguix yesterday and had quite a bit of trouble throughout the process. Is there a good place to link my writeup once I finish it, such that others in the community can benefit (at least from the stuff I link to in mine)
Feb 21 10:08:30 <daviwil>	port19: Definitely post it on the forum: https://forum.systemcrafters.net
Feb 21 10:10:49 <port19>	Will do, thanks for the vids motivating me to get more lispy :D
Feb 21 10:25:42 <Kingsy>	fyrfaras: yeah I am going to switch that over tonight. %base-services is just causing too many issues.
Feb 21 10:26:54 <Kingsy>	fyrfaras: did you have to install anything else? have in mind I am using xorg-server with stumpwm so no gdm package or anything. I needed to manually install gtk and things. but its still a nightmare missing an env dvar to start with causing gtk applications to crash, specifcially around gsettings
Feb 21 10:27:33 <Kingsy>	daviwil: I tried your tip with (glib "bin") <- for gsettings but that didnt help either. only referencing the gnum/store in the env var manually does the trick right now.

Feb 21 10:43:22 <daviwil>	Kingsy: I missed the discussion about the problem before, what's going on?
Feb 21 10:53:11 <Kingsy>	daviwil: I was trying to just seting a base guix installation. I didnt even want a login manager, so I just started with base-services, along with some of the key standouts such as dbus etc. Then I just installed xorg-server, xinit and stumpwm and loaded the stumpwm. Everything looked good to start with but I have big problems around gtk applications, seems there are some key env vars which are not 
Feb 21 10:53:17 <Kingsy>	set, the fix outlined here fixes xfce4-terminal -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-guix/2016-05/msg00036.html <- by manually setting GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR, however this is clearly a really dirty solution given I am referencing the gnu/store directly. it just makes me think there are some fundemental things missing! perhaps just switching to desktop-services instead of base will help but I am 
Feb 21 10:53:23 <Kingsy>	not confident at this point
Feb 21 10:58:25 <Kingsy>	anyway sorry, that was a long explanation. but the reason for mentioning your glib idea was because it was failing as you can see in the ticket with reference to a gsettings gtk schema. sepcifcally FileChooser, before this it was failing with others, so I had to install gsettings and dconf. As I said, just "finding" these things makes me think I am missing a bunch more stuff. and obviously setting 
Feb 21 10:58:31 <Kingsy>	env vars like this is not a workable solution moving forward. something is seriously wrong :D 
Feb 21 10:59:38 <daviwil>	hmmm
Feb 21 10:59:49 <daviwil>	I did run into this issue, trying to remember what I did
Feb 21 10:59:57 <daviwil>	because I also don't use %desktop-services
Feb 21 11:03:03 <daviwil>	I can't really locate anything else that I'm doing inside of my config that specifically addresses missing gsettings schemas 
Feb 21 11:03:21 <daviwil>	that env var is actually unset in my environment
Feb 21 11:03:22 <daviwil>	GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR
Feb 21 11:04:31 <daviwil>	Kingsy: do you have a value for $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR in your environment?  That would come from elogind service running
Feb 21 11:07:10 <Kingsy>	echo $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
Feb 21 11:07:12 <Kingsy>	/run/user/1000
Feb 21 11:08:11 <Kingsy>	daviwil: elogind is in my system config -> https://bpa.st/6ICA
Feb 21 11:08:36 <Kingsy>	is that output for $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR corrent? I ws expecting a bunch of stuff to different dirs
Feb 21 11:08:55 <daviwil>	that's right
Feb 21 11:09:04 <daviwil>	so your user session is running correctly it seems
Feb 21 11:09:17 <daviwil>	where did you install the glib package in the way that I did it?  home config?
Feb 21 11:10:18 <Kingsy>	moment
Feb 21 11:11:33 <Kingsy>	daviwil: https://bpa.st/J67Q <- there you go. all I did was just add it to the list of package. have in mind however in order to get to where I am now I installed a bunch of stuff manually as I mentioned
Feb 21 11:12:10 <Kingsy>	daviwil: https://bpa.st/EG5A <- namely gtk, gsettings and dconf
Feb 21 11:30:16 <alternateved>	Hello
Feb 21 11:30:51 <alternateved>	Apparently Emacs 30 is going to get completion overlay: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/completion-preview.el
Feb 21 12:01:18 <trev>	alternateved: is that like "ghost text" or something with the completion popup?
Feb 21 12:06:38 <alternateved>	trev: exactly, ghost text overlay
Feb 21 12:07:42 <alternateved>	Demo here: https://0x0.st/H5KQ.webm
Feb 21 12:10:02 <trev>	nice. i used that on neovim but turned it off recently since it was interfering when i was editing in the middle of text. it's only experimental on there
Feb 21 12:27:20 <trev>	daviwil: it's not allowed to use Guix and say "i don't remember what i did" 
Feb 21 12:28:06 <trev>	if you say that then you have to add "✅ only using Guix cuz Scheme" to your profile
Feb 21 13:06:50 <nyovella>	man, what a morning.. system wasn't booting (root pool wasn't imported), so i went and checked a lot of things, skimmed through logs.. then tried reinstalling bootloader, reinstlaled kernel, checked more things.. and at last figured out how to fix it. Deleting zpool.cache and regenerating it anew. Fun times. 
Feb 21 13:14:23 <naokotani>	decided to try diesel for this project. I really like it so far
Feb 21 13:14:26 <naokotani>	I like how migrations work
Feb 21 13:23:56 <daviwil>	alternateved: that's pretty cool
Feb 21 13:24:44 <daviwil>	Kingsy: looking at those links now
Feb 21 13:25:37 <daviwil>	Kingsy: I'd try removing the gsettings-desktop-schemas and gsettings-desktop-schemas-next packages from your "user profile" using `guix remove`, it might be conflicting with your guix home profile
Feb 21 13:26:18 <daviwil>	use `guix home describe -I` to see the list of packages installed in your home profile
Feb 21 13:26:38 <daviwil>	my advice these days is to avoid using `guix install` for anything if you use `guix home` because it can lead to issues
Feb 21 13:26:58 <port19>	I'm having a little trouble with wifi on my installed nonguix. The driver is present, but I can't see any of the familiar utilities. I have `(use-service-module networking)` in my config.scm. I could not find the docs where this is defined
Feb 21 13:27:36 <daviwil>	port19: you may need to install the utilities you're looking for, `use-service-module` only imports the `(gnu services networking)` namespace
Feb 21 13:27:59 <daviwil>	it doesn't install any packages or configure anything
Feb 21 13:29:29 <port19>	What's the procedure to get an offline package over there? Or am I better off reinstalling? What's also problematic is the installer bug that errors if I install any substantial amount of packages due to no space left on its 6GB root partition
Feb 21 13:30:31 <daviwil>	port19: is wpa_supplicant accessible?
Feb 21 13:30:33 <daviwil>	installed, I mean
Feb 21 13:31:13 <port19>	I have ip and iw. I don't see wpa_supplicant in shell completion
Feb 21 13:31:48 <port19>	Also no network manager, connman or iwd
Feb 21 13:32:31 <port19>	Oh, I think I get the semantics of use-service-modules now :facepalm:
Feb 21 13:33:35 <Kingsy>	daviwil: that doesnt help. I added gsettings because it wasnt working to attempt to fix it. so the removal of any of the guix install packages doesnt help fix my issue.
Feb 21 13:35:22 <port19>	guix package --list-installed returns nothing
Feb 21 14:38:26 <naokotani>	I had to do the github tour for class becuse all my teacher has is a totally empty account lol
Feb 21 14:38:51 <naokotani>	nice class prep
Feb 21 15:02:11 <benoitj>	hi folks
Feb 21 15:02:44 <daviwil>	hey benoitj
Feb 21 15:06:27 <benoitj>	hi daviwil 
Feb 21 15:12:51 <daviwil>	how's it going?
Feb 21 15:22:16 <benoitj>	pretty good, sickness almost gone and energy is going up. my newer nix config is getting back to shape. what about you?
Feb 21 15:23:10 <daviwil>	oh, I didn't know you were sick, glad you're starting to feel better!
Feb 21 15:23:23 <daviwil>	I'm doing well, working on the material for the final week of the Guile course
Feb 21 15:23:31 <daviwil>	it's been fun!
Feb 21 15:23:46 <benoitj>	 yeah, kind of regular cold, maybe lasting a bit long. havent been sick since I had covid in 2020. so not complaining :P
Feb 21 15:23:58 <benoitj>	wow, already final week :)
Feb 21 15:24:16 <daviwil>	I guess having teenage kids helps with not picking up all the random viruses :)
Feb 21 15:24:36 <daviwil>	my daughter has brought home probably 4 or 5 viruses already and it's not even March
Feb 21 15:25:58 <benoitj>	yeah, when they are sick, we just dont see them, they stay even more in their rooms
Feb 21 15:26:26 <benoitj>	I remember, just tell yourself she's giving you super power
Feb 21 15:26:28 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 21 15:27:06 <daviwil>	lol, that is a good way to look at it
Feb 21 15:29:21 <trev>	benoitj: do you feed them food under the door?
Feb 21 15:30:12 <benoitj>	trev: yeah, they have a trap door
Feb 21 15:32:22 <benoitj>	i'm j/k :P, it's just when they are sick, they dont feel like seeing anyone, like when we are sick. unlike young childrens that dont really understand that or dont understand they just have to wait before they get better
Feb 21 15:44:45 <talos>	Good day Crafters~
Feb 21 15:46:42 <daviwil>	hey talos

Feb 21 18:53:19 <naokotani>	how many varchars should I do for email?
Feb 21 18:53:51 <naokotani>	In your humble opininos
Feb 21 18:56:04 <daviwil>	https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3696
Feb 21 18:56:13 <daviwil>	I dunno if that has a specific answer 
Feb 21 18:57:04 <trev>	The format of an email address is local-part@domain, where the local-part may be up to 64 octets long and the domain may have a maximum of 255 octets
Feb 21 19:02:31 <trev>	anyone doing something interesting right now
Feb 21 19:02:33 <trev>	?
Feb 21 19:03:18 <daviwil>	about to play Call of Duty while ignoring a meeting
Feb 21 19:04:45 <alternateved>	Rebel
Feb 21 19:13:59 <naokotani>	yeah I think an email can be up to 377 characters
Feb 21 19:14:12 <naokotani>	which is..
Feb 21 19:15:19 <naokotani>	so thats the maximum, but I see people with conflicting views online
Feb 21 19:15:43 <naokotani>	because there is a good chance it someone's email is 300 characters you probably don't want their email
Feb 21 19:16:33 <naokotani>	trev: working on a new rust project. trying out diesel
Feb 21 19:16:47 <naokotani>	so far its super dope
Feb 21 19:25:56 <trev>	is that a web server?
Feb 21 19:26:05 <naokotani>	its SQL ORM
Feb 21 19:27:07 <naokotani>	to make the tables you it creates directorys with up.sql and down.sql and you wrote the raw sql in those files to creat and drop the tables
Feb 21 19:27:27 <naokotani>	and then you can use structs with some macros to interact with the tablse
Feb 21 19:29:11 <trev>	sounds neat. never used it. i stay far away from database stuff until forced
Feb 21 19:30:02 <naokotani>	oh many i love databases
Feb 21 19:30:11 <naokotani>	man*
Feb 21 19:30:17 <trev>	i'm going to coin the term Zero-Dataist and promote NoDataDB
Feb 21 19:30:48 <naokotani>	well, if you have to use SQL I can recommend diesel because you would barely know sql is invovled
Feb 21 19:32:09 <trev>	yeah seems more pleasant 
Feb 21 19:32:30 <trev>	i like graphql (unpopular opinion)
Feb 21 19:32:48 <naokotani>	I don't mind it
Feb 21 19:33:00 <benoitj>	why unpopular? using graphql at the right time is ok
Feb 21 19:33:12 <benoitj>	there are some languages where graphql is easier to implement than others
Feb 21 19:33:33 <naokotani>	I used graphql with web design and it was really nice
Feb 21 19:33:56 <naokotani>	It used it with a CMS
Feb 21 19:34:37 <naokotani>	my only problem was it was embeded in my javascript and I found it a pain to get syntax highlighting in emacs
Feb 21 19:35:11 <naokotani>	basically the graphql for the react component was in the component file
Feb 21 19:35:17 <trev>	probably should've put it in a separate file :\
Feb 21 19:35:53 <naokotani>	I considred it. although it felt silly to do it solely because I couldnt' get highlighting to work
Feb 21 19:37:27 <naokotani>	I was just following what the framework documentation recommended 
Feb 21 19:44:07 <naokotani>	hard to beat sql though. You know what thy say, a JOIN a day keeps the head doctor away!
Feb 21 19:45:33 <trev>	they definitely do not say that...
Feb 21 20:03:06 <daviwil>	GitHub notification: "You're invited to join the @MicrosoftCopilot organization" -- No thanks
Feb 21 20:03:58 <trev>	join and file issues about Microsoft Flightsim and say you thought you were training to be a copilot

Feb 21 20:07:08 <daviwil>	And some might say "David, what have you done to help improve software quality at Microsoft?" and to them I'd say "Absolutely nothing, friend, absolutely nothing"
Feb 21 20:08:14 *	trev jack_nicholson_nodding.gif
Feb 21 20:17:14 <naokotani>	teams seems to be uniquely bad
Feb 21 20:21:36 <trev>	i used to use it in the browser
Feb 21 20:22:03 <daviwil>	Teams is bad
Feb 21 20:24:42 <benoitj>	there is a new version that is supposed to be better
Feb 21 20:24:50 <trev>	Teams2?
Feb 21 20:25:27 <benoitj>	teams "new"
Feb 21 20:25:38 <benoitj>	that is what the icon says
Feb 21 20:25:43 <daviwil>	It's just as bad :)
Feb 21 20:25:48 <daviwil>	I'm using it right now
Feb 21 20:26:51 <benoitj>	yeah, they also changed how many people you see when in screen sharing mode with a "paging system"
Feb 21 20:27:13 <benoitj>	I was like "we're missing x on the call", but he was on the 2nd page :P
Feb 21 20:28:07 <benoitj>	At least I dont have to use webex anymore
Feb 21 20:28:14 <daviwil>	ancient technology
Feb 21 20:28:33 <trev>	woah webex...what about gotomeeting?
Feb 21 20:28:56 <benoitj>	never used that one
Feb 21 20:29:05 <benoitj>	ms communicator was pretty good
Feb 21 20:29:24 <benoitj>	did not take 1gig of ram
Feb 21 20:29:48 <trev>	benoitj: what about HipChat?
Feb 21 20:29:52 <benoitj>	or was it skype for business
Feb 21 20:30:26 <benoitj>	one of these had an HATEOS API
Feb 21 20:35:12 <naokotani>	teams new appears to actually be significanlty worse somehow

Feb 21 20:38:01 <cow_2001>	were?
Feb 21 20:38:04 <cow_2001>	i wish it were?
Feb 21 20:38:12 <alternateved>	wish you were here
Feb 21 20:38:14 <cow_2001>	tenses are too tense for me :(
Feb 21 20:38:32 <benoitj>	cow_2001: bleach
Feb 21 20:38:35 <cow_2001>	alternateved: i only remember the words as mumblings
Feb 21 20:38:51 <benoitj>	only if it's surface, if it's in it, sledge hammer
Feb 21 20:38:53 <cow_2001>	ozone and/or hypochloric acid, okay
Feb 21 20:39:03 <cow_2001>	benoitj: oh my god
Feb 21 20:39:14 <cow_2001>	oh my god
Feb 21 20:39:15 <alternateved>	Yeah, if it's in then my condolences
Feb 21 20:39:45 <benoitj>	I guess it depends on how the wall is built
Feb 21 20:39:51 <cow_2001>	concrete
Feb 21 20:39:57 <alternateved>	Dehumidifier, heat, airing the room, ozoning from time to time, maybe some anti-fungus thingies that will also poison you
Feb 21 20:40:02 <benoitj>	blocks or just solid wall?
Feb 21 20:40:10 <cow_2001>	solid
Feb 21 20:40:35 <benoitj>	fix the leak first, then anti fungus stuff
Feb 21 20:40:49 <alternateved>	fungus is also extremely tricky because it might be huge underneath :/
Feb 21 20:40:59 <trev>	cow_2001: a mushroom walks into a bar...the bartender says "we don't serve mushrooms"...he replies "why not? i'm a fun guy"
Feb 21 20:40:59 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 21 20:41:04 <cow_2001>	oh my god
Feb 21 20:41:12 <benoitj>	and it needs to dry, if you have a leak, it will never dry
Feb 21 20:41:25 <alternateved>	Yeah as benoitj said, remove the source of excessive humidity and dry the hell out of place
Feb 21 20:41:58 <cow_2001>	i wish i could just burn everything down
Feb 21 20:41:58 <benoitj>	but if it's a crack, fix the crack first. that can be done with polyuretane foam injection
Feb 21 20:42:03 <cow_2001>	i hate these creatures
Feb 21 20:43:21 <benoitj>	need to fix the root cause with these creatures, if it's leak, fix the leak, if it's general humidity, then better ventilation, if it's bathroom, exauhst fan, basement, deumidifier, 
Feb 21 20:44:28 <benoitj>	basement, could also be the french drain, then dig and fix the french drain
Feb 21 20:45:24 <benoitj>	high water table, sump pump
Feb 21 20:46:02 <cow_2001>	it's over ground.  it's the roof, i think
Feb 21 20:46:17 <cow_2001>	we had a huge buildup of water due to a clogged drain weeks ago
Feb 21 20:46:34 <cow_2001>	a bit less than a metre... twice month apart or somesuch
Feb 21 20:47:06 <cow_2001>	and then there's the humid insulation under the broken tiled roof
Feb 21 20:47:18 <cow_2001>	which was fixed, but now needs to be dried up with time
Feb 21 20:51:03 <cow_2001>	oh well! :D
Feb 21 21:11:57 <SummerEmacs>	hi hi
Feb 21 21:11:59 <SummerEmacs>	👋

Feb 21 21:15:46 <SummerEmacs>	you didn't know about those?
Feb 21 21:15:47 <cow_2001>	i've been to those biomes before
Feb 21 21:15:49 <cow_2001>	very strange
Feb 21 21:15:58 <SummerEmacs>	yea i used to play a bit when i was a lot younger
Feb 21 21:16:08 <cow_2001>	it was a good game
Feb 21 21:16:20 <SummerEmacs>	yea i still have it i just haven't played in years and years
Feb 21 21:16:28 <SummerEmacs>	but i used to love my little farms 🙃 
Feb 21 21:16:43 <SummerEmacs>	i would do vegetarian playthroughs so i wouldn't have to kill the animals
Feb 21 21:16:44 <cow_2001>	the little cows are adorable
Feb 21 21:16:55 <SummerEmacs>	it's harder at first but when you get potatoes going, you're good to go
Feb 21 21:17:10 <cow_2001>	mushroom soups don't stack :(
Feb 21 21:17:14 <SummerEmacs>	they have polar bears too!
Feb 21 21:17:21 <SummerEmacs>	yea but the bowls stack now i think? i'm not sure.
Feb 21 21:17:25 <SummerEmacs>	i think i remember that being a new thing

Feb 22 00:23:44 <benoitj>	cow_2001: if you compare people blocking sites, other sites are blocking them for the same reasons
Feb 22 00:23:59 <benoitj>	at least for the 3 I looked
Feb 22 00:25:35 <Kingsy>	if i am setting xlock in my system config with this -> https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/Xorg.html <- why would I get this error "error: slock: unbound variable" on reconfigure?
Feb 22 01:10:25 <Fade>	does slock exist on the path?
Feb 22 01:12:23 <Fade>	that's my only guess.
Feb 22 01:16:44 <Kingsy>	oh I figured it out. you need to specify each package in use-modules
Feb 22 02:15:55 <benoitj>	took me a while to understand what was going on with slock

Feb 22 14:11:33 <fyrfaras`>	Heya~ everybunny :3
Feb 22 14:12:25 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Are you there?
Feb 22 14:24:06 <alternateved>	Hi fyrfaras` 
Feb 22 14:26:08 <fyrfaras`>	Hewwo alternateved ^^
Feb 22 14:26:14 <daviwil>	hey folks
Feb 22 14:26:33 <fyrfaras`>	Hy~ daviwil :3
Feb 22 14:27:20 <daviwil>	hey fyrfaras`
Feb 22 14:27:57 <fyrfaras`>	daviwil: I wasn't able to continue the fourth exercise yet. Since I have late shift this week my free time is a bit shuffled, sorry =w="
Feb 22 14:28:24 <fyrfaras`>	I could you send my solutions for the first three, though.
Feb 22 14:28:38 <daviwil>	no worries!  you can definitely send along only the first three
Feb 22 14:28:48 <fyrfaras`>	And thanks for the review of the first weeks exercises <3
Feb 22 14:28:55 <daviwil>	I still haven't gotten around to giving everyone feedback on Week 1 yet :)
Feb 22 14:29:17 <daviwil>	I'm starting to realize that 1 week is a pretty tight timeframe for everyone
Feb 22 14:29:25 <fyrfaras`>	daviwil: Alrighty, I will put them in the thread on the forum this evening :3
Feb 22 14:30:34 <fyrfaras`>	Maybe extent the course to five sessions? So you could reduce the amount of information a bit?
Feb 22 14:31:23 <daviwil>	someone suggested on the forum to possibly have it be 8 weeks total with 2 weeks between sessions to give people more time to absorb the information and work on exercises
Feb 22 14:31:34 <daviwil>	still 4 sessions, just more time between
Feb 22 14:31:59 <daviwil>	could just give more time for procrastination though, who knows
Feb 22 14:32:14 <fyrfaras`>	daviwil: That sounds like a neat idea, too. As long as it's possible and not stressful for you :)
Feb 22 14:32:56 <daviwil>	I think it would actually work well because it would give me more time to reviews and provide more information during the 2 weeks period
Feb 22 14:33:04 <fyrfaras`>	I think thanks to the forum peeps are able to exchange practices and ideas pretty good.
Feb 22 14:33:24 <daviwil>	yeah, though it's still a little disorganized.  there's a lot I want to improve for next time
Feb 22 14:34:03 <fyrfaras`>	And IMHO the procastination wouldn't be that strong. Our group seems really motivated to learn Guile :3c
Feb 22 14:34:12 <daviwil>	yes, that is a good thing!
Feb 22 14:34:16 <fyrfaras`>	Oh, do you know Etherpad?
Feb 22 14:34:23 <daviwil>	I have used it once or twice
Feb 22 14:35:40 <fyrfaras`>	Maybe have something similiar at the sessions? So the members are able to ask questions or show code snippets and everybunny can contribute interactively. I think the chat in ninja is a tad clunky ^^"
Feb 22 14:36:23 <daviwil>	the chat is definitely clunky.  Etherpad is a really interesting idea, thanks!
Feb 22 14:37:13 <fyrfaras`>	My girlfriend hosts a HedgeDoc instance and is really happy with it.
Feb 22 14:40:30 <daviwil>	HedgeDoc also seems really cool
Feb 22 14:40:36 <fyrfaras`>	Also there seems to be something like this in Emacs called "crdt".
Feb 22 14:40:42 <fyrfaras`>	https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/crdt.html
Feb 22 14:41:13 <fyrfaras`>	HedgeDoc has a low barrier since you just need a web browser, though.
Feb 22 14:41:34 <daviwil>	would be cool to do it all in Emacs, but that would assume that everyone uses Emacs.  Probably in this course they do, but not sure about others if I start looking at other languages
Feb 22 14:41:45 <daviwil>	pretty cool that this package exists though
Feb 22 14:42:18 <fyrfaras`>	I haven't tried it yet but it's bunny cool indeed :3
Feb 22 14:43:55 <fyrfaras`>	Kingsy: Do you still have gsettings problems?
Feb 22 14:44:17 <fyrfaras`>	Kingsy: Did you install the "glib" package?
Feb 22 14:45:15 <fyrfaras`>	Kingsy: https://www.reddit.com/r/GUIX/comments/11hz4q3/which_package_provides_gsettings/?rdt=59647
Feb 22 14:45:41 <fyrfaras`>	Kingsy: It seems that a certain person named daviwil answered that question :D
Feb 22 14:46:38 <daviwil>	lol, I don't even remember doing that
Feb 22 14:47:53 <fyrfaras`>	daviwil: A blast from the past xD
Feb 22 14:56:02 <talos>	Good day all~
Feb 22 14:56:14 <fyrfaras`>	Heya~ talos!
Feb 22 14:56:54 <talos>	Yo~
Feb 22 15:10:35 <ashraz>	daviwil: I won't join tomorrow, so that might be a perfect time to continue work on the chatbot :D
Feb 22 15:11:10 <fyrfaras`>	!roll 1e99
Feb 22 15:11:36 <ashraz>	Heh.
Feb 22 15:12:33 <fyrfaras`>	ashraz: I'm afraid that some other buns will carry your torch x3c
Feb 22 15:15:38 <daviwil>	ashraz: who is going to play the role of leftpad? :)
Feb 22 15:16:09 <fyrfaras`>	What and who is leftpad BTW :) ?
Feb 22 15:16:27 <daviwil>	leftpad is the name of a notorious JavaScript package in the npm registry
Feb 22 15:16:39 <daviwil>	https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/
Feb 22 15:17:10 <ashraz>	daviwil: Maybe I'll try to conjure a bot today evening. But I would need to make sure that I can disable it remotely. Would be a little bit too risky to just let it lose on #systemcrafters-live without any supervision :D
Feb 22 15:17:14 <alternateved>	leftpad is our lord and savior 
Feb 22 15:17:26 <daviwil>	Ashraz was mentioning it as a joke related to something else I said, but I thought he was telling me that the name of a person who subscribed to the channel was "leftpad" so I thanked this leftpad person
Feb 22 15:18:30 <fyrfaras`>	LOL xD
Feb 22 15:18:43 <ashraz>	And nowadays we thank leftpad for any glitches and/or mishaps during the stream.
Feb 22 15:18:57 <ashraz>	E.g. the hypnotic hyprland slides and evil eyes :D
Feb 22 15:23:49 <talos>	Tramp in eshell is fun, the end
Feb 22 15:24:59 <talos>	Was using it to ssh to a box on my LAN
Feb 22 15:25:37 <talos>	Nice how you can just call up dired or whatever else mode right there
Feb 22 15:26:05 <talos>	https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell
Feb 22 15:47:21 <fyrfaras`>	daviwil and ashraz: The leftpad story is really funny x3
Feb 22 16:02:19 <Fade>	Good Morning
Feb 22 16:07:53 *	Fade watches prot do a stream working on some of his packages
Feb 22 16:16:03 <daviwil>	didn't know he streamed today!  looks like it just ended
Feb 22 16:16:20 <fyrfaras`>	Fade!
Feb 22 16:16:23 <Fade>	aye. I came in late so I'm seeing the recording.
Feb 22 16:16:26 <Fade>	fyrfaras`!
Feb 22 16:16:28 <fyrfaras`>	:3
Feb 22 16:16:41 <fyrfaras`>	I fixed the networking problem!
Feb 22 16:18:23 <fyrfaras`>	Yesterday I've got access to the machine in Network A. After tinkering with some SSHD config settings I gave up but today I tcpdumped additional interfaces.
Feb 22 16:18:57 <Fade>	what did you find?
Feb 22 16:19:40 <fyrfaras`>	On the Net A side of my firewall there weren't any ACK from client A but client A received SYNs and replied with ACK BUT not through my firewall.
Feb 22 16:20:03 <Fade>	that's a pretty serious misconfiguration..
Feb 22 16:20:34 <fyrfaras`>	Turned out that client A was missing a route to client B.
Feb 22 16:21:23 <fyrfaras`>	We have multiple firewalls to different networks. And client A had only a default route to a different firewall.
Feb 22 16:21:29 <Fade>	the ICMP traffic shouldn't have found its way through the firewall either, in that case.
Feb 22 16:21:57 <Fade>	unless the second firewall was forwarding control traffic to the appropriate place..
Feb 22 16:22:13 <Fade>	I hate networking; there's a reason I'm not a network engineer any more. :]
Feb 22 16:22:16 <fyrfaras`>	Before I took over the firewall business there were ICMP redirects in place but I deactivated that behaviour at the firewalls.
Feb 22 16:24:06 <fyrfaras`>	It worked with a constant ping from client B to A since client B has a explicit route and I suppose that client A caches the routing information temporarily until the pinging stops and this route gets forgotten. 
Feb 22 16:24:52 <Fade>	that is a very peculiar behaviour
Feb 22 16:25:38 <fyrfaras`>	I've learned that ICMP redirects are not a good thing, because one can lost vital information and it blurres the transperacy within the networkk Hence the deactivation.
Feb 22 16:25:39 *	Fade blames windows
Feb 22 16:25:48 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: It's always Windows!
Feb 22 16:26:22 <fyrfaras`>	Also I did nothing wrong. It was the client A fault for not having the explicit route configured :D
Feb 22 16:26:24 <Fade>	screwing around with ICMP is generally a bad practice. it's necessary for many tcp/ip level protocol operations
Feb 22 16:26:37 <fyrfaras`>	agreed
Feb 22 16:27:06 <Fade>	frame size negotiation in particular can be a problem on a stitched lan.
Feb 22 16:27:19 <fyrfaras`>	In the end, it was still fun! Also thanks again for your help, Fade :3
Feb 22 16:27:22 <Fade>	are these firewalls connected with VPN tunnels?
Feb 22 16:27:47 <fyrfaras`>	No, it's a inside network.
Feb 22 16:27:56 <Fade>	I'm unsure how much benefit you got from anything I did. I'm glad the problem is solved, particularly if the issue was in the critical path for your boss. :)
Feb 22 16:28:14 <fyrfaras`>	A matchroska net withi the companies business network segments.
Feb 22 16:28:41 <Fade>	I was doing a VPN contract in January
Feb 22 16:28:50 <Fade>	I was feeling sorry for myself. :)
Feb 22 16:29:39 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Just chatting about it and giving some constructive and lighthearted advice really calmed my mind :) 
Feb 22 16:30:19 <fyrfaras`>	It's the journey alongside other bunnies and not the goal that is important ;3
Feb 22 16:30:43 <Fade>	I'm a very goal driven person. :D
Feb 22 16:31:11 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Oh, with what kind of VPN solution are you tortured x3 ?
Feb 22 16:31:34 <Fade>	IPSEC
Feb 22 16:31:54 <Fade>	openswan specifically
Feb 22 16:32:04 <fyrfaras`>	Well it could be worse... I guess?
Feb 22 16:32:32 <Fade>	openswan with heterogenous remote concentrators is always exciting.
Feb 22 16:32:47 <Fade>	the ipsec spec is liberally interpreted, particularly by microsoft and cisco.
Feb 22 16:33:00 <fyrfaras`>	The only VPN experience I have is with Wireguard and Cisco GRE Tunnels. 
Feb 22 16:33:19 <Fade>	the cisco vpn facility is generally sane
Feb 22 16:33:44 <Fade>	but in my case the firewall was running an ancient debian which meant that the openswan implementation was also ancient.
Feb 22 16:33:49 <fyrfaras`>	One standards multiple implementations and a lot of incompatibilties =w=
Feb 22 16:33:54 <Fade>	so I was up to my neck in the C source code.
Feb 22 16:34:17 <fyrfaras`>	Uff, that sounds adventureous owo
Feb 22 16:34:27 <Fade>	you take the money, you do the job.
Feb 22 16:34:56 <Fade>	I am long past my career as a C programmer, so there was a fairly large impedance mismatch. :)
Feb 22 16:35:10 <Fade>	otoh, emacs is a wonderful powertool
Feb 22 16:35:54 <fyrfaras`>	Emacs will save our souls :D
Feb 22 16:36:11 <fyrfaras`>	At least for those who have one x3
Feb 22 16:36:19 <Fade>	emacs is as black as my heart, but it does save my sanity from time to time. :)
Feb 22 16:36:24 <Fade>	don't tell cthulhu
Feb 22 16:36:39 <fyrfaras`>	My lips are sealed ;3c
Feb 22 16:36:49 <fyrfaras`>	And my fingers tied!
Feb 22 16:37:20 <fyrfaras`>	I hope Cthulu doesn't use IRC!
Feb 22 16:37:40 <fyrfaras`>	s/Cthulu/Cthulhu
Feb 22 16:38:00 <Fade>	the deep old ones use a five dimensional machine encoding.
Feb 22 16:38:02 <alternateved>	They do, surely
Feb 22 16:38:17 <alternateved>	But with their acolytes 
Feb 22 16:38:31 <Fade>	the type systems in their languages are uncoercible to binary.
Feb 22 16:38:55 <Fade>	otoh, I suspect they can probably just encode their thoughts in binary telepathically.
Feb 22 16:38:59 <alternateved>	Cthulhu fhtagn!
Feb 22 16:44:17 <BigEatie>	Howdy folks
Feb 22 16:44:26 <fyrfaras`>	Hewwo BigEatie :3
Feb 22 16:44:32 <Fade>	heya BigEatie 
Feb 22 16:45:46 <fyrfaras`>	Wait a minute! Does IRC actually stand for "Indirect Resurrection of Cthulhu" D: ?!
Feb 22 16:46:47 <daviwil>	it does now!
Feb 22 16:48:49 <Fade>	immanentizing the eschaton since 1981
Feb 22 16:54:19 <fyrfaras`>	And it's Finnish hence Trve Cvlt Metal \m/
Feb 22 16:55:43 <Fade>	I think I may have to cue up some Heavy Devy.
Feb 22 16:56:21 <fyrfaras`>	What's a Devy :)c ?
Feb 22 16:56:55 <Fade>	Devin Townsend
Feb 22 16:57:28 <Fade>	famously of Strapping Young Lad
Feb 22 16:57:29 <fyrfaras`>	Neat! I love the Strapping Young Lad stuff especially City.
Feb 22 16:57:59 <fyrfaras`>	Detox and Unterneath the Waves is so awesome uwu
Feb 22 16:58:25 <Fade>	are you Finnish?
Feb 22 16:59:24 <Fade>	\m/
Feb 22 16:59:25 <fyrfaras`>	Minä en suomilainen. Olen saksalainen pälättää :3
Feb 22 16:59:55 <fyrfaras`>	I'm not Finnish but I can speak some. I'm from Germany.
Feb 22 17:00:27 <Fade>	I've spent quite a bit of time in Bavaria
Feb 22 17:00:32 *	fyrfaras` listens to Suomi Finland Perkele right now.
Feb 22 17:00:49 <Fade>	but I'm an english speaking monoglot, which I wish wasn't true.
Feb 22 17:01:04 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Neat, which part of Bavaria :) ?
Feb 22 17:01:15 <Fade>	Munich and a town called Landshut
Feb 22 17:01:31 <fyrfaras`>	I'm living in the east of Germany, Leipzig to be precise ^^
Feb 22 17:01:38 <Fade>	cool
Feb 22 17:01:58 <Fade>	fix your firewalls before the russians come sniffing them. :D
Feb 22 17:02:10 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: I try xD
Feb 22 17:02:29 <fyrfaras`>	Where are you bunning from if I may ask, Fade :) ?
Feb 22 17:02:36 <Fade>	Canada
Feb 22 17:02:39 <Fade>	I'm in Toronto
Feb 22 17:02:54 <Fade>	oh, also Regensburg
Feb 22 17:03:03 <fyrfaras`>	Cool!
Feb 22 17:03:04 <Fade>	when I was in Bavaria, not now. :)
Feb 22 17:03:17 <fyrfaras`>	That would be strange :D
Feb 22 17:03:58 <Fade>	I always imagined Leipzig to be a very metal place.
Feb 22 17:04:12 <fyrfaras`>	It is :D
Feb 22 17:04:34 <Fade>	not so much as Danzig/Gdansk, but close
Feb 22 17:05:00 <alternateved>	Gdansk is a metal place?
Feb 22 17:05:31 <Fade>	well, it used to be called Danzig
Feb 22 17:05:33 <fyrfaras`>	It's funny that Mayhem was the first Metal band from the "West" to play in Leipzig after the wall fell.
Feb 22 17:05:39 <Fade>	maybe its character changed with its name.
Feb 22 17:06:06 <Fade>	I don't normally associate rabbits with metal
Feb 22 17:06:17 <Fade>	you must be an unusual citizen :)
Feb 22 17:06:18 <fyrfaras`>	Danzig = Programs written in Zig by Dan the programmer ;3
Feb 22 17:06:56 <Fade>	were you alive prior to the wall coming down?
Feb 22 17:07:31 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: Still waters run deep! Everything cute and fluffy can be Metal as bug UwU
Feb 22 17:07:41 *	Fade laughs
Feb 22 17:08:14 <fyrfaras`>	Fade: No, that was before my hatchday.
Feb 22 17:08:36 <Fade>	*nod*
Feb 22 17:09:03 <Fade>	watership down is very metal, so maybe you're right.
Feb 22 17:09:55 <fyrfaras`>	:D
Feb 22 17:44:41 <daniel42>	i know glenn danzig

Feb 22 18:41:29 <Fade>	there are
Feb 22 18:41:33 <Fade>	I wrote one
Feb 22 18:41:45 <Fade>	I've seen people play D&D in irc.
Feb 22 18:42:14 <Fade>	random chatter kind of messes up any display, so it's best for games that don't require one.
Feb 22 18:44:28 <nm0i>	There were plenty of irc driven games, trivia used to be the most popular one.
Feb 22 18:46:00 <nm0i>	I used to play eggdrop arena in mid 00's quite a lot.
Feb 22 18:46:19 <Fade>	I've been working on my irc bot
Feb 22 18:46:26 <Fade>	I was going to join it here.
Feb 22 18:48:35 <nm0i>	eggdrop (irc bot) was how I got stuck in tcl for a while as a teen.
Feb 22 18:49:22 <Fade>	I remember eggdrop and it's tcl extension idiom.
Feb 22 18:49:29 <Fade>	I was never that fond of it. :)
Feb 22 18:51:54 <nm0i>	It grew very bloated by the end of its lifetime. It was a lot of things for many people, even could server as services replacement or to do ddos coordination, very strange piece of software. 
Feb 22 18:51:56 <nm0i>	Some of the scripts were so useful I ended up implementing minimal eggdrop emulator just to run them.
Feb 22 18:52:18 <Fade>	it came out of the IRC culture of the mid-nineties.
Feb 22 18:52:36 <Fade>	there were no channel or nick services on efnet back then.
Feb 22 18:52:39 <Fade>	so bots were common.
Feb 22 18:53:17 <nm0i>	Was before my time, i met IRC already with services, but I'm aware.
Feb 22 18:53:41 <Fade>	big irc networks were like open warzones back then.
Feb 22 18:53:42 <nm0i>	Nowadays services tend to be baked in, even.
Feb 22 18:53:47 <Fade>	channel defence was a real concern.
Feb 22 18:53:53 <Fade>	most bots had means to do so.
Feb 22 18:54:39 <nm0i>	irc wars lasted into early 10s on some networks
Feb 22 18:54:47 *	Fade nods
Feb 22 18:54:58 <nm0i>	to have classic experience you just needed to crast the services...
Feb 22 18:55:04 <nm0i>	*crash
Feb 22 18:55:10 <Fade>	heh
Feb 22 18:55:27 <Fade>	it has been a _long_ time since I had to defend a channel from a takeover.
Feb 22 18:55:42 <Fade>	I don't even have combat macros loaded in my client any more.
Feb 22 18:58:03 <nm0i>	libera even no longer does a port scan on you to check whether you're a proxy user
Feb 22 18:59:27 <nm0i>	as nostalgic as it sounds its probably for the best that all of this is in the past
Feb 22 19:09:27 <daniel42>	@fyrfaras in twitch chat the have bots with simple games.
Feb 22 19:15:00 <fyrfaras`>	Very fascinating! Thanks for the history Fade and nm0i :)
Feb 22 19:15:23 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: toki! sina pilin seme? :3
Feb 22 19:15:36 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: Sounds cool ^^
Feb 22 19:16:15 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: Did you know there is even a Toki Pona sign language :D
Feb 22 19:20:20 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: mi pilin ike
Feb 22 19:20:45 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: how many signs?
Feb 22 19:21:52 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: https://www.instructbot.co.uk/
Feb 22 19:22:17 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: oh, sina pilin ike seme o.o ?
Feb 22 19:22:34 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: I think for all 120 basic words IIRC.
Feb 22 19:23:40 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: mi lape lili
Feb 22 19:24:04 <trev>	what language are you both always chatting in?
Feb 22 19:24:12 <daniel42>	toki pona
Feb 22 19:24:25 <daniel42>	a lamguage with only 120 words
Feb 22 19:24:34 <trev>	conlang? nice
Feb 22 19:24:38 <daniel42>	yes
Feb 22 19:25:03 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: sina lape pona "tonight" x3
Feb 22 19:26:12 <daniel42>	but i use chatgpt to translate lol
Feb 22 19:26:36 <trev>	lol wut
Feb 22 19:27:00 <fyrfaras`>	I'm doing it the classic way by pestering my girlfriend with it until she will speak it as well >:3
Feb 22 19:28:46 <nm0i>	That's very cool
Feb 22 19:28:50 <nm0i>	It's eerie how it has almost esperanto level of comprehensiveness without prior knowledge...
Feb 22 19:29:56 <fyrfaras`>	And there is even a whole writing system x3
Feb 22 19:31:57 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: sina sona tuki tiki?
Feb 22 19:33:37 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: sona means "to know" but I can't find "tuki tiki" in my dictionary.
Feb 22 19:35:37 <daniel42>	fyrfaras: Tokiponido
Feb 22 19:39:15 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: "you know how to do?"
Feb 22 19:39:40 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: So Tokiponido is an offspring of toki pona.
Feb 22 19:39:44 <daniel42>	the "tuki tiki" conlang with only 39 words modifies Toki Pona and pushes towards true minimalism
Feb 22 19:40:04 <fyrfaras`>	daniel42: Uff x3
Feb 22 19:41:03 <Fade>	get one of those keyboards with five keys on it, and you'd really be cooking with gas.
Feb 22 19:44:44 <fyrfaras`>	Or just two for 0 and 1!
Feb 22 19:45:36 <Fade>	with 39 words, I guess you could have a key for every word in your lang.
Feb 22 19:46:01 <Fade>	I guess they're novel, but I don't really understand the synthetic language thing.
Feb 22 19:46:01 <daniel42>	https://conlang.fandom.com/wiki/Tuki_Tiki
Feb 22 19:48:46 <trev>	li pula
Feb 22 19:50:42 <fyrfaras`>	I will stick with toki pona for a while before my brain wants to language hop again =w=
Feb 22 19:52:29 <daniel42>	yeah and chatgpt cant translate tuki tiki
Feb 22 19:53:07 <Motaik>	Hello everyone! New here. Been following SystemCrafters Emacs From Scratch series
Feb 22 19:53:31 <daniel42>	motaik: thats how i found it as well
Feb 22 19:53:35 <fyrfaras`>	Motaik: Welcome :3 !
Feb 22 19:53:46 <Motaik>	that's neat guys!
Feb 22 19:53:50 <Motaik>	thanks!
Feb 22 19:54:12 <Motaik>	so, how're you guys doing so far?
Feb 22 19:54:18 <Fade>	Welcome
Feb 22 19:54:25 <Fade>	everything is nominal
Feb 22 19:54:42 <daniel42>	nominal vs structural?
Feb 22 19:55:05 <Motaik>	i'm in the process of making my way over to exwm
Feb 22 19:55:12 <Motaik>	do u guys use it?
Feb 22 19:55:20 <Fade>	I do not
Feb 22 19:55:24 <Fade>	I use stumpwm
Feb 22 19:55:38 <Fade>	various people around here have used it, and a few still do.
Feb 22 19:55:51 <fyrfaras`>	I'm still at GNOME Wayland ^^
Feb 22 19:55:58 <Motaik>	never tried stumpwm, is it a dynamic twm?
Feb 22 19:56:07 <Fade>	no, it's a manual tiler.
Feb 22 19:56:08 <Motaik>	thats cool
Feb 22 19:56:45 <Motaik>	I tried a few wm so far, but decided to give exwm a try on guix
Feb 22 20:01:45 <Motaik>	gonna roll out for now. Try to enter exwm for the first time. Nice meeting u guys!
Feb 22 20:01:55 <Fade>	o7
Feb 22 20:06:49 <daniel42>	a storm is coming tonight
Feb 22 20:08:43 <daniel42>	https://www.meteoalarm.org/en/live/?t=today
Feb 22 20:19:46 <Fade>	it's insanely warm here today.

Feb 22 22:03:39 <Tru>	I was going to share my Journey of it on a website but so many already have done that, haha!
Feb 22 22:04:49 <Tru>	It is helpful for me to Study some everyday and then Post about it somewhere to keep me going well.
Feb 22 22:05:10 <Tru>	I just haven't decided where to Post about it.
Feb 22 22:06:24 <Tru>	It might be cool for us to find a Study Group doing it somewhere
Feb 22 22:11:36 <daniel42>	tru: there is also a mew js version of that book
Feb 22 22:11:42 <daniel42>	new
Feb 22 22:12:26 <Tru>	Yes, I saw that!  That might be cool to look at someday too!
Feb 22 22:13:36 <Tru>	I'm drinking a Red Bull now so I'd better get back to Studying for it to be effective there, haha!
Feb 22 22:13:45 <Tru>	Happy Hacking Everyone!
Feb 22 22:17:32 <cow_2001>	noooo tru went away.  was going to write: "i don't take notes in classes because a billion people took notes of the same topics before me"
Feb 22 22:18:02 <cow_2001>	as a counter argument
Feb 22 22:18:07 <cow_2001>	ad absurdum is fun
Feb 22 22:32:49 <chuck>	I have been watching the videos and trying to follow along with the SICP PDF. 
Feb 22 22:33:26 <chuck>	the vidoes are very low rez.
Feb 22 22:49:38 <cow_2001>	chuck: no, they're lofi
Feb 22 22:50:02 <cow_2001>	OG lofi
Feb 22 22:51:09 <cow_2001>	listen to the opening music!
Feb 22 23:41:47 <BigEatie>	daviwil: just FYI, some of your show-note links don't seem to be working i.e. https://new.systemcrafters.net/live-streams/may-12-2023/
Feb 22 23:57:05 <Fade>	apparently there was a big network outage in the united states today.
Feb 22 23:58:36 <cow_2001>	ugh i misnamed a guix build phase symbol and it didn't run my artisanal build phase ~_~
Feb 22 23:59:07 <cow_2001>	'patch-source-shebang instead of 'patch-source-shebangs
Feb 22 23:59:13 <cow_2001>	the second's the right one ~_~
Feb 23 01:35:33 <benoitj>	morning folks
Feb 23 01:38:38 <BigEatie>	Morning, benoitj 
Feb 23 01:38:57 <Fade>	heya, benoitj 
Feb 23 01:48:06 <benoitj>	hey Fade BigEatie 
Feb 23 01:49:39 <benoitj>	how is everyone
Feb 23 01:49:50 <benoitj>	seems calm, no SummerEmacs 
Feb 23 01:49:53 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 23 01:52:51 <BigEatie>	Lol, indeed
Feb 23 01:53:48 <BigEatie>	Just finished Mr. Robot. What a fantastic show.
Feb 23 01:54:04 <benoitj>	it's on my list. havent watched that yet
Feb 23 01:54:26 <BigEatie>	It's slow at times, but the payoff is worth it... would highly recommend it.
Feb 23 01:54:50 <BigEatie>	One thing you'll notice right off the bat is how much more accurate it is on the tech side than your typical hacking movies/shows
Feb 23 01:55:48 <BigEatie>	I generally appreciate that about a show -- liked that a lot about the Queen's Gambit too -- one of the best depictions of Chess I've seen
Feb 23 01:56:53 <cow_2001>	okay, i have a sort of working package definition
Feb 23 01:56:59 <cow_2001>	now i need to patch guile
Feb 23 01:57:28 <benoitj>	BigEatie: great. makes me want to start tonight :AP
Feb 23 01:57:29 <benoitj>	:P
Feb 23 01:57:31 <benoitj>	hi cow_2001 
Feb 23 01:58:28 *	Fade is just hacking
Feb 23 01:58:49 <Fade>	pretty quiet evening
Feb 23 01:59:50 <piethesailor>	Hi Fade!
Feb 23 02:00:16 <piethesailor>	Perfect timing. It usually is slow this late
Feb 23 02:00:28 <Fade>	heya piethesailor 
Feb 23 02:00:33 <cow_2001>	hihi
Feb 23 02:03:30 <mretka>	Hey Fade benoitj piethesailor cow_2001 
Feb 23 02:03:35 *	mretka is just drawing today
Feb 23 02:05:46 <cow_2001>	moo
Feb 23 02:10:27 <piethesailor>	About to hit the road. I'll be back on in 50m
Feb 23 02:16:13 <mretka>	BigEatie I watched only S1 of Mr. Robot, great show
Feb 23 02:24:19 *	mretka feels that reading AWS architecture diagrams is like using another language altogether at times
Feb 23 02:24:28 <benoitj>	hi mretka 
Feb 23 02:24:35 <mretka>	Hey benoitj :D
Feb 23 02:25:01 <mretka>	I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm decoding some sort of ancient Egyptian papyrus scroll reading these architecture diagrams
Feb 23 02:25:11 <benoitj>	mretka: i'm starting my aws architect cert the week after
Feb 23 02:25:31 <mretka>	Awesome benoitj! Are you going for the associate one? Or the professional one?
Feb 23 02:26:16 <benoitj>	this one is the associate
Feb 23 02:27:29 <benoitj>	it's a bit to see what it is, a bit to solidify many things I know already, and to help the group with more people with the paper
Feb 23 02:27:59 <mretka>	And this is the Rosetta Stone https://awsicons.dev/
Feb 23 02:28:18 <benoitj>	we'll see, the only certification I started, and never finished, is a security certificate in which I hacked 23 of their supposedly solutions to security issues
Feb 23 02:29:16 <benoitj>	we stopped sending people on that certification after I went
Feb 23 02:29:17 <mretka>	Awesome! Wishing you luck on the cert!
Feb 23 02:29:21 <mretka>	hahaha
Feb 23 02:29:27 *	mretka lets out a sensible chuckle
Feb 23 02:29:36 <mretka>	I wonder why :P
Feb 23 02:30:01 <mretka>	It's been a while since I did the Solutions Architect Associate exam
Feb 23 02:30:04 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 23 02:30:27 <mretka>	It's great to get a general view of AWS services and how to integrate them, and also learn about common architecture patterns
Feb 23 02:30:35 <benoitj>	mretka: in practice, I design, deploy, automate regularly, on gcp, aws, azure, rack space and many on-prem infra
Feb 23 02:30:56 <mretka>	Ohhh, this one is in the bag then
Feb 23 02:31:00 <mretka>	You use Terraform, right?
Feb 23 02:31:36 <benoitj>	terraform, I also used cloud formation to deploy a container app, with WAF, CDN and the whole thing, on a push of a button :P
Feb 23 02:32:07 <benoitj>	i've done some chef and ansible too, but not recently
Feb 23 02:32:48 <mretka>	I'm used to working directly with CloudFormation
Feb 23 02:33:31 <benoitj>	and I regularly integrate github enterprise, gitlab, azure devops, jenkins and I did once that aws CI crap, source something
Feb 23 02:33:55 <mretka>	You mean CodePipeline?
Feb 23 02:34:05 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 23 02:34:16 <benoitj>	that was couple of years ago
Feb 23 02:34:53 <benoitj>	that was on an app where I shrink the code from ~70k lines to 5k lines and it did the same thing :P
Feb 23 02:35:08 <benoitj>	but better
Feb 23 02:35:10 <mretka>	Oh wow, holy tree shaking, Batman! :P
Feb 23 02:35:10 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 23 02:35:22 <benoitj>	yeah, i'm the tree shaker :D
Feb 23 02:36:51 <mretka>	Nice! I'm the bug basher at work
Feb 23 02:37:15 <mretka>	Today I was mentoring a teammate on how to investigate bugs
Feb 23 02:37:23 <benoitj>	you know that you can tell how skilled someone is by using git stats tool? new devs, barely no commits, barely no lines produced, intermediate, small number of commits, large number of lines, experienced, large number of commits, a lot of lines added, even more lines removed
Feb 23 02:38:12 <benoitj>	nice, reading code and troubleshooting is a skill to learn
Feb 23 02:39:40 <mretka>	Interesting, this is my first time hearing about this git stats tool, is that from the CLI? Or is it platform specific?
Feb 23 02:39:59 <mretka>	Or is it this? https://github.com/IonicaBizau/git-stats
Feb 23 02:40:21 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 23 02:40:27 <benoitj>	I think so. let me check
Feb 23 02:41:18 <benoitj>	https://gitstats.sourceforge.net/
Feb 23 02:41:59 <benoitj>	I think theone you found is similar, and visual are nice
Feb 23 02:42:58 <mretka>	Yeah, I'm gonna test both, TIL
Feb 23 02:43:02 <mretka>	Thanks so much for sharing!
Feb 23 02:43:28 <benoitj>	https://gitstats.sourceforge.net/examples/git/
Feb 23 02:43:39 <benoitj>	example of stats for git itself
Feb 23 02:43:51 <benoitj>	I use the "authors" tab a lot
Feb 23 02:44:47 <benoitj>	for a regular team, everyone shows up on the list, so you can figure out if you need to coach around doing more commits, or having someone else to help them with their tasks
Feb 23 02:59:44 <benoitj>	mretka: I looked at the one you sent, it looks good, but it's just a console view github like activity chart
Feb 23 03:00:10 <benoitj>	quite different than the other git-stats
Feb 23 03:00:19 <mretka>	Yeah, they're quite different
Feb 23 03:00:25 <mretka>	I'm testing the git-stats you sent
Feb 23 03:01:39 <benoitj>	that one is interesting too: https://github.com/fouadh/gocan
Feb 23 03:01:57 <benoitj>	code-maat too, but I havent used it
Feb 23 03:03:10 <mretka>	This book referenced in the repo seems pretty interesting https://pragprog.com/titles/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene/
Feb 23 03:03:25 <mretka>	I would read it if I were more interested in the software development track
Feb 23 03:03:54 <mretka>	I'm slowly realizing that I'm transitioning to another role soon hehe
Feb 23 03:07:29 <mretka>	Now I'm gathering stats for the Emacs source repo
Feb 23 03:28:18 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 23 03:28:34 <benoitj>	which role if I may ask?
Feb 23 03:29:25 <benoitj>	you're more into ops, and cloud?
Feb 23 03:37:02 <mretka>	Yeah, I'm slowly migrating to ops and cloud
Feb 23 03:37:19 <mretka>	I wanna get into a management role later on in my career too
Feb 23 03:37:31 <benoitj>	cool
Feb 23 03:40:28 <benoitj>	there is a lot of needs in ops and cloud.
Feb 23 03:45:33 <mretka>	I gotta go for today, see you benoitj :D
Feb 23 03:52:01 <benoitj>	see you
Feb 23 05:58:11 <BigEatie>	mretka: It was a good show to finish
Feb 23 05:58:17 <BigEatie>	I throroughly enjoyed it
Feb 23 07:11:45 <fyrfaras>	Good morning everybunny :3
Feb 23 07:12:13 <fyrfaras>	BigEatie: Mr. Robot is a really cool series!
Feb 23 09:47:57 <glenneth>	Morning Folx o/
Feb 23 10:03:33 <nm0i>	mrnng glenneth 
Feb 23 10:21:52 <glenneth>	Hey nm0i How's things with you?
Feb 23 10:23:01 <nm0i>	i'm okay, procrastinating but okay, you?
Feb 23 10:23:30 <glenneth>	I'm doing OK.  Wishing for more hours in a day lol.
Feb 23 10:55:24 <trev>	glenneth: can you just carry some over from the day before?
Feb 23 11:03:30 <glenneth>	Hi trev I wish that were possible.  But I'm already in the negative from several days before :)
Feb 23 11:06:31 <nm0i>	Who needs sleep and health anyway?
Feb 23 11:08:55 <glenneth>	nm0i: You sound like my boss :D
Feb 23 11:09:50 <nm0i>	Something tells me he is not as sarcastic as I am...
Feb 23 11:20:49 <glenneth>	definitely not.  He means it lol
Feb 23 11:41:19 <glenneth>	Anyone here use the colemak layout?
Feb 23 11:57:33 <trev>	glenneth: no but looked into changing layouts and my head started spinning 
Feb 23 11:57:45 <trev>	colemak-dh or whatever 
Feb 23 12:35:00 <glenneth>	I'm using the hhkb and it has been suggested that switching to colemak may be better.  I suffer with carpal tunnel and get "frozen" shoulder during longer writing sessions.
Feb 23 12:39:51 <daviwil>	Hey folks! Thoughts on stream topics for today? I might try playing with the latest release of Guile Hoot, but not sure yet
Feb 23 12:44:16 <daviwil>	Maybe one on creating a minimal writing environment in Emacs

Feb 23 14:47:05 <teesh3rt>	btw daviwil: discord works!
Feb 23 14:47:16 <theesm>	always have to think of https://xkcd.com/1987/ regarding python
Feb 23 14:47:16 <nanounanue>	(as a Data Scientist that fight with python everyday I can testify)
Feb 23 14:47:25 <nanounanue>	Yup theesm
Feb 23 14:47:30 <nanounanue>	:)
Feb 23 14:47:35 <dthompson>	I packaged tons of stuff for guix back in the day, much less so these days, so I haven't really dealt with wheels in any serious manner
Feb 23 14:48:07 <teesh3rt>	oh my god i just saw that xkcd and yes relatable
Feb 23 14:48:14 <teesh3rt>	it feels like there are too many ways to install things in python
Feb 23 14:48:20 <dthompson>	I wrote the ruby build system for guix and found the same resistance to distros in the ruby community.  thankfully most of the issues were easy enough to work around.
Feb 23 14:48:21 <nanounanue>	I have settled a compromise: Use guix to set up an isolated shell, and then poetry on top
Feb 23 14:48:40 <nanounanue>	Not happy with that
Feb 23 14:48:53 <dthompson>	but I had the rubygems people tell me that test suites are only for developers
Feb 23 14:48:53 <nanounanue>	so, any workaround I am happy to listen
Feb 23 14:49:05 <teesh3rt>	for me there are way too many ways to install stuff in python: pip, venv, conda, poetry, tox, etc etc etc
Feb 23 14:49:06 <dthompson>	this was like 10 years ago
Feb 23 14:49:46 <dthompson>	language-specific package managers would be *fine* if they just wouldn't be so hostile to other ways of doing things

Feb 23 14:52:28 <dthompson>	like, you don't have to package your app for *any* distros if you just make it easy enough to build from source.
Feb 23 14:52:37 <teesh3rt>	theesm: "If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea." meanwhile the ways to install stuff:
Feb 23 14:52:59 *	dthompson steps off soapbox
Feb 23 14:56:27 <teesh3rt>	ok so i got discord working, i might try and set up exwm, it looks pretty nice
Feb 23 14:59:58 <talos>	Good day all
Feb 23 15:01:33 <nm0i>	talos the almewghty
Feb 23 15:03:45 <teesh3rt>	for some reason emacs dosent show up in gdm
Feb 23 15:03:53 <teesh3rt>	and yes i did do `guix install emacs-exwm`
Feb 23 15:04:38 <daviwil>	teesh3rt: You need to install it as a system package for it to show up there
Feb 23 15:04:46 <teesh3rt>	so sudo guix?
Feb 23 15:04:57 <daviwil>	as part of `guix system reconfigure`, in your system configuration file
Feb 23 15:05:51 <teesh3rt>	can i not just do "sudo guix"? i dont want to mess with files
Feb 23 15:05:59 <teesh3rt>	like `sudo guix install emacs-exwm`
Feb 23 15:08:50 <daviwil>	If you do that, it just gets installed as a package in the root user's profile
Feb 23 15:08:55 <daviwil>	Which is not what you want
Feb 23 15:09:08 <daviwil>	 the .desktop file only gets added at the system level if you add the package to the system configuraiton
Feb 23 15:09:23 <jakef>	he means the packages field of the operating-system definition
Feb 23 15:09:45 <jakef>	i think
Feb 23 15:09:47 <daviwil>	If he means that, then yes, you would need to use `sudo guix system reconfigure`
Feb 23 15:09:55 <daviwil>	but I'm guessing he really means `sudo guix install`
Feb 23 15:10:25 <daviwil>	it's better to get comfortable with the idea of editing a declarative configuration file for system and home configurations because all of the value of Guix is in those
Feb 23 15:10:33 <daviwil>	`guix install` is just a convenience command, I would not recommend using it
Feb 23 15:10:43 <jakef>	sorry david, you were the "he" i was referring to. i'll be quiet
Feb 23 15:10:46 <daviwil>	oh :)
Feb 23 15:10:58 <daviwil>	no need to be quiet, you are trying to help!
Feb 23 15:11:06 <daviwil>	I am reading messages on the go so I'm not absorbing all the details
Feb 23 15:11:13 <jakef>	all good :)
Feb 23 15:11:24 <teesh3rt>	oh i get it
Feb 23 15:11:34 <teesh3rt>	where is that one file yall are talking about?
Feb 23 15:11:40 <teesh3rt>	i know its a .scm file, i just forgot its location
Feb 23 15:11:45 <daviwil>	after installation I believe it's /etc/configuration.scm
Feb 23 15:11:53 <daviwil>	copy that to your home folder and make changes to it
Feb 23 15:12:09 <daviwil>	maybe it's not there actually
Feb 23 15:12:11 <teesh3rt>	its config.scm
Feb 23 15:12:43 <benoitj>	morning folks
Feb 23 15:12:45 <daviwil>	yep, you'll want to keep your own copy of that going forward because it's how you will apply changes to your config at the systme level
Feb 23 15:12:46 <daviwil>	hey benoitj
Feb 23 15:12:47 <benoitj>	hey daviwil 
Feb 23 15:12:50 <daviwil>	alright, AFK for a bit
Feb 23 15:13:15 <benoitj>	booting the day. need my coffee
Feb 23 15:15:03 <teesh3rt>	ok i copied it and changed it, what now?
Feb 23 15:15:08 <teesh3rt>	(im vvvv new to guix sorry)
Feb 23 15:16:11 <trev>	i've been using my bash script that feeds all xdg desktop files into fzf instead of rofi 
Feb 23 15:16:20 <trev>	dangit i was stuck on scrollback
Feb 23 15:16:43 <teesh3rt>	trev: hello welcome to the present
Feb 23 15:17:16 <trev>	😳
Feb 23 15:17:34 <nanounanue>	I also need cofee
Feb 23 15:18:53 <nanounanue>	Anyone is putting emacs as a shepherd service in her/his guix home config? If so, mind to share the code and maybe discuss the advantages of having in it or just using `(server-start)` in the `init` files?
Feb 23 15:23:59 <jakef>	teesh3rt: sudo guix system reconfigure config.scm
Feb 23 15:24:37 <jakef>	then reboot to ensure all changes take effect
Feb 23 15:27:29 <teesh3rt>	i feel like im doing something i shouldnt even though that is what im supposed to do
Feb 23 15:27:45 <teesh3rt>	that i think just tells you how new i am to these package managers where you edit files to install stuff
Feb 23 15:28:20 <jakef>	if you mess it up, there'
Feb 23 15:28:37 <teesh3rt>	yeah ik
Feb 23 15:28:38 <jakef>	s a good chance that reconfigure will throw an error for you
Feb 23 15:28:40 <teesh3rt>	1. there are generations
Feb 23 15:28:45 <teesh3rt>	2. it will throw a syntax error
Feb 23 15:29:10 <jakef>	live on the wild side a little
Feb 23 15:29:54 <teesh3rt>	question: does nix work in a similar way? where you edit files to do stuff?
Feb 23 15:30:41 <daviwil>	Yes, they are based on the same ideas
Feb 23 15:31:32 <teesh3rt>	its indexing objects right now, which i guess means it works
Feb 23 15:31:37 <teesh3rt>	it didnt give me an error yet
Feb 23 15:31:43 <benoitj>	teesh3rt: guix is a fork of nix ;)
Feb 23 15:31:57 <teesh3rt>	oh yeah now that i look at the names it makes sense
Feb 23 15:32:04 <teesh3rt>	guix sounds like "gnu + nix"
Feb 23 15:32:09 <jakef>	nix gets the credit for coming up with the idea, but i think using guile for config is an objective improvement?
Feb 23 15:32:57 <teesh3rt>	im guessing that is because guile (may???) be able to execute code
Feb 23 15:33:05 <benoitj>	yes, there are more. no non-free too
Feb 23 15:33:21 <teesh3rt>	(related to reconfigure) oh it works now! its downloading stuff!
Feb 23 15:36:37 <teesh3rt>	ok its applying a ton of grafts now
Feb 23 15:36:42 <teesh3rt>	it usually does that at the end
Feb 23 15:36:46 <teesh3rt>	so im guessing i did it right?
Feb 23 15:37:08 <jakef>	only one way to find out
Feb 23 15:39:37 <teesh3rt>	ok its done im gonna reboot
Feb 23 15:41:51 <teesh3rt>	hello from exwm!
Feb 23 15:42:04 <teesh3rt>	it works!
Feb 23 15:42:17 <jakef>	tremendous
Feb 23 15:47:33 <trev>	*crashes*
Feb 23 15:49:19 <teesh3rt>	so far it didnt actually!
Feb 23 15:49:23 <teesh3rt>	its actually working very much fine
Feb 23 15:49:32 <teesh3rt>	im doing some stuff now to actually make this a viable wm
Feb 23 15:49:37 <teesh3rt>	(aka a function to open stuff0
Feb 23 15:49:48 <teesh3rt>	s/0/\)
Feb 23 16:15:05 <theesm>	jakef: guile is definitely an improvement over nixlang (and in some regards over c++ what nix uses for some of its cli tooling where guix uses guile instead; shepherd uses guile as well, systemd what nix uses doesn’t use nixlang). Guix feels a lot more consistent because of this imho 
Feb 23 16:20:00 <trev>	i always forget there's no systemd on guix
Feb 23 16:23:42 <piethesailor>	Hola a todos! Feliz viernes!
Feb 23 16:25:24 <daviwil>	Hey piethesailor 
Feb 23 16:25:43 <theesm>	luckily there isn’t; I don’t say this from an anti-systemd standpoint (don’t think it’s a bad init system) but from a using guile to define services makes more sense to me & shepherd is more minimal which I like standpoint though 
Feb 23 16:28:41 <piethesailor>	Hi daviwil.
Feb 23 16:29:07 <piethesailor>	Guys.. I might have bricked my laptop 0_o
Feb 23 16:29:16 <piethesailor>	Running an ubuntu installation
Feb 23 16:29:51 <trev>	all laptops with ubuntu are bricks i think
Feb 23 16:29:59 <piethesailor>	lol
Feb 23 16:31:42 <piethesailor>	I think ubuntu is alright. Tried to reinstall and encrypt harddrive this time around. went through installer successfully, rebooted, removed intsall media and hit enter like the prompt said. Ive been on a black screen and a blinking "_" underscore since 9:30pm central yesterday
Feb 23 16:32:08 <piethesailor>	Im afraid to turn in off/reboot. 
Feb 23 16:37:19 <piethesailor>	Distrobox sounds cool though
Feb 23 16:38:07 <teesh3rt>	finally i got a viable system
Feb 23 16:46:37 <daviwil>	lol, the Alpine install I was going to use for the stream is hosed
Feb 23 16:46:48 <daviwil>	apparently I installed a grub update which makes the system unbootable
Feb 23 16:46:50 <piethesailor>	No!
Feb 23 16:47:16 <daviwil>	first Call of Duty reset my level to 1 and now this!
Feb 23 16:47:16 <piethesailor>	you and me both with hosed OS's
Feb 23 16:47:32 <piethesailor>	Thats a feature of call of duty tho
Feb 23 16:47:38 <piethesailor>	is it not?
Feb 23 16:47:49 <daviwil>	not when it happens to everyone in the game
Feb 23 16:47:55 <daviwil>	I think one of their game services must be malfunctioning
Feb 23 16:48:10 <daviwil>	lets see if I can get distrobox working in Guix
Feb 23 16:48:19 <daviwil>	in...  10 minutes
Feb 23 16:48:28 <piethesailor>	Good luck soldier
Feb 23 16:48:53 <piethesailor>	o7
Feb 23 16:49:12 <daviwil>	Press F to pay respects
Feb 23 16:49:19 <piethesailor>	F
Feb 23 16:51:38 <benoitj>	havent played cod for a long time. I recently (like 2 weeks ago) started playing dayz with my daughters. quite calm most of the time, and really stressfull sometimes
Feb 23 16:51:41 <Fade>	Good Morning
Feb 23 16:52:19 <benoitj>	hey Fade 
Feb 23 16:52:22 <piethesailor>	Morning Fade
Feb 23 16:52:29 <Fade>	fellas
Feb 23 16:52:46 <Fade>	is the stream happening today?
Feb 23 16:53:04 <teesh3rt>	daviwil: wait a minute about the grub update, just `guix package --roll-back`
Feb 23 16:53:06 <daviwil>	it will happen one way or another...  Distrobox may not be working though thanks to an Alpine issue
Feb 23 16:53:15 <daviwil>	teesh3rt: This is an Alpine linux box I'm dealing with
Feb 23 16:53:58 <teesh3rt>	o no
Feb 23 16:54:21 <piethesailor>	We can just use the time to talk Guile/Guix
Feb 23 16:54:21 <piethesailor>	lol
Feb 23 16:54:28 <piethesailor>	maybe dabble in some CL
Feb 23 16:54:34 <daviwil>	I may just have to fix it live, not a big deal
Feb 23 16:54:35 <piethesailor>	you know, for Fade and I
Feb 23 16:54:47 <daviwil>	I found a promising mailing list post
Feb 23 16:54:52 <Fade>	morganw is also a CL hacker
Feb 23 16:55:00 <daviwil>	oops, I mean fix Distrobox on guix
Feb 23 16:55:18 <Fade>	although it's daviwil's show, and he doesn't love CL. we have to accept that he's still a frood. :)
Feb 23 16:55:18 <piethesailor>	the more the merrier Fade
Feb 23 16:55:27 <daviwil>	what's a frood
Feb 23 16:55:34 <piethesailor>	fr
Feb 23 16:55:51 <Fade>	https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Frood
Feb 23 16:56:08 <daviwil>	ahhh, of course
Feb 23 16:56:34 <piethesailor>	I don't descriminate lisps. I like them all. There are just a number of solid packages in CL that accomodate my needs, scheme isnt quite there 
Feb 23 16:56:54 <morganw>	Fade: I think I would only pass as a CL dabbler
Feb 23 16:56:58 <piethesailor>	I own all the Little Schemer books, they are really great
Feb 23 16:57:15 <teesh3rt>	is there a function to pick a random item from a list in elisp?
Feb 23 16:57:19 <alternateved>	Little Schemer books are nice
Feb 23 16:57:26 <piethesailor>	little scheme, the reasoned schemer, the little learner, etc..
Feb 23 16:57:49 <piethesailor>	(nth (random 0 10000) *list*)
Feb 23 16:57:53 <piethesailor>	maybe?
Feb 23 16:58:05 <piethesailor>	or rather
Feb 23 16:58:07 <alternateved>	daviwil: ah, the famous grub update
Feb 23 16:58:16 <daviwil>	yeah it got me
Feb 23 16:58:25 <piethesailor>	(nth (random o (length *list*) *list*))
Feb 23 16:58:29 <daviwil>	I had to turn on edge for Hyprland and I got bit
Feb 23 16:58:43 <alternateved>	Didn't they fix it lately?
Feb 23 16:58:53 <daviwil>	no idea, I may have pulled before the fix went out
Feb 23 16:59:21 <teesh3rt>	piethesailor: thank you!
Feb 23 16:59:45 <alternateved>	https://fosstodon.org/@alpinelinux/111959820210366133
Feb 23 16:59:48 <morganw>	I got the Little Schemer book and tried Guile, but came out preferring Common Lisp. (Although possibly because I liked the Common Lisp book that I read more and I've never felt like I knew what I was doing in Geiser)
Feb 23 17:00:07 <trev>	make it a grub stream, but not the bootloader, just you chowing down on some grub
Feb 23 17:00:30 <piethesailor>	Sorry its this teeth3rt (nth (random (length *list*)) *list*)
Feb 23 17:00:47 <morganw>	And doubly uncomfortable trying to manage Guix in Geiser.
Feb 23 17:01:04 <Fade>	teesh3rt: https://0x0.st/H5Jt.txt
Feb 23 17:01:38 <alternateved>	morganw: Which CL book?
Feb 23 17:01:41 <alternateved>	Practical CL?
Feb 23 17:02:02 <piethesailor>	The one think I love about cl over schemes is the repl experience. If there was a marriage of all that is sly and guile, + the package I need(lol) I'd be super happy
Feb 23 17:02:16 <Fade>	in elisp there's a builtin: seq-random-elt
Feb 23 17:02:29 <Fade>	defined in seq.el
Feb 23 17:02:53 <morganw>	alternateved: I bought the new version of "A Gentle Introduction
Feb 23 17:02:53 <morganw>	to Symbolic Computation" https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/book.pdf
Feb 23 17:03:15 <piethesailor>	Oh yeah teesh3rt. Fade suggestion is much cleaner
Feb 23 17:03:26 <piethesailor>	probably a faster implementation of the idea also
Feb 23 17:03:31 <Fade>	anyhow it's a trivial function.
Feb 23 17:03:54 <piethesailor>	sure
Feb 23 17:03:56 <daviwil>	stream chat booting up in #systemcrafters-live
Feb 23 17:04:04 <piethesailor>	heading over
Feb 23 17:05:55 <Fade>	scheme hangs me up on lisp-1 issues
Feb 23 17:06:05 <Fade>	my brain is fully steeped in lisp-2-ness
Feb 23 17:06:37 <Fade>	still, if it couldn't be CL I'd accept scheme as a second choice.
Feb 23 17:06:52 <Fade>	I like racket
Feb 23 17:09:18 <teesh3rt>	Fade: thanks! it works!
Feb 23 17:11:34 <daniel42>	is it  easy  to learn new things  from little books style?
Feb 23 17:19:36 <Fade>	victory!
Feb 23 17:22:32 <drishal>	yoo 
Feb 23 17:45:51 <Fade>	o/
Feb 23 17:50:56 <fyrfaras>	daniel42: toki~ I will answer you later since I'm reading the little schemer ATM. We are attending critical mass soon :3
Feb 23 18:39:28 <benoitj>	hey shom2 
Feb 23 18:39:36 <shom2>	I cannot get irc to give me my nick "shom" even when I'm logged in and authenticated. Unfortunately I spend most of my time fighting irc the rare times I have time to come hang out!
Feb 23 18:39:36 <benoitj>	are you the real shom?
Feb 23 18:39:45 <shom2>	I am 😭
Feb 23 18:40:13 <benoitj>	shom2: might want to ask libera folks about it
Feb 23 18:41:06 <benoitj>	nix flakes, you want to use that for your system and home configuration right?
Feb 23 18:41:17 <shom2>	Thanks @benoitj. I've been using web clients. I just need to get a permanent setup on desktop and mobile.
Feb 23 18:41:24 <shom2>	Yes I do!
Feb 23 18:41:33 <benoitj>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoB0pHZ0fpI
Feb 23 18:42:00 <benoitj>	that goes through the process, from using the generated files from the nix installer, to converting that config to a nix flake
Feb 23 18:42:21 <benoitj>	https://git.sr.ht/~benoit/dotfiles
Feb 23 18:42:48 <benoitj>	that is my config. just pay attention to the "milhouse" system configuration in the flake. the other systems are not yet migrated to my new modules
Feb 23 18:43:01 <shom2>	I want to just jump straight to flakes deep end! I enjoy docker-compose a lot and want to make everything declarative. Ansible has been good but configuring it isn't automated yet.
Feb 23 18:43:30 <trev>	shom2: did you try to GHOST it with /nickserv GHOST shom [password] ?
Feb 23 18:43:43 <shom2>	Awesome, thanks! I should be doing my guile homework but I might be tempted with this 😬
Feb 23 18:47:21 <shom2>	trev I did ghost and it said shom has been ghosted and then I identified and then did /nick
Feb 23 18:47:32 <shom2>	Hahaha now it says this
Feb 23 18:47:51 <benoitj>	shom2: in a nutshell, you use the installer to install nix, this generates /etc/nixos/configuration.nix and hardware-configuration.nix, you copy this in a folder in your home, git init, flake init, add a nixosconfiguration that loads the configuration.nix, add everything to git (flakes requires that), nixos-rebuild swich --flake .#
Feb 23 18:47:54 <shom2>	NickServ 11:46:13
Feb 23 18:47:54 <shom2>	[NOTICE] You are already logged in as shom.
Feb 23 18:47:55 <shom2>	⚠ The nickname 'shom2' is already in use!
Feb 23 18:48:22 <benoitj>	oh, there is "account" and nicknames
Feb 23 18:48:40 <benoitj>	you seems to have registered the account shom, but use the nickname shom2 :P
Feb 23 18:48:53 <shom2>	😂 I'm not trying to be Shom2, doing /nick shom says that shom2 is already in use 🤦🏽‍♂️
Feb 23 18:50:04 <benoitj>	"regain" command?
Feb 23 18:51:15 <benoitj>	otherwise, it could be /msg nickserv group when using "shom"
Feb 23 18:51:21 <shom>	Yay!!! Regain did it. Ghost + regain! Thanks benoitj and trev
Feb 23 18:51:24 <benoitj>	shom: looks like it worked
Feb 23 18:51:40 <trev>	nice!
Feb 23 18:51:51 <trev>	it's SHOM time!!!! - your new slogan
Feb 23 18:53:22 <benoitj>	now it's the real and only shom!
Feb 23 18:54:03 <shom>	Hahahaha Shom is my real name and so many of my friends type SHOM and say SHOM when greeting me!
Feb 23 18:55:01 <shom>	@benoitj thanks for the Nix startup info. I feel I'm going to fall into that rabbit hole. Why did I learn guile in the beginner course 😂
Feb 23 18:55:16 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 23 18:55:43 <benoitj>	there are couple of us here using nix. talos, myself, there is another one too that I forget
Feb 23 18:59:35 <shom>	You guys need some nix representation on the forum. I don't like monocultures!
Feb 23 18:59:37 <benoitj>	just pass buy when you get in trouble
Feb 23 19:00:12 <benoitj>	yes, I just need to follow-up with david. we were making a list of possible categories and tags, but never implemented it
Feb 23 19:00:32 <benoitj>	like os category, but #guix or #nix tags
Feb 23 19:00:47 <benoitj>	we were about to test something, but both got busy
Feb 23 19:03:11 <shom>	Yeah tags are really nice, I've been embracing tags more than hierarchical structures in more things and making tags hierarchical instead like
Feb 23 19:05:44 <benoitj>	yeah, tags are nice
Feb 23 19:09:19 <shom>	M-x shom time! (also known as lunch!)
Feb 23 19:09:30 <benoitj>	(time 'shom)
Feb 23 19:09:38 <shom>	😂
Feb 23 19:33:46 <Fade>	hail victorious hacker.
Feb 23 19:52:01 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 23 20:16:45 <BigEatie>	daviwil: did you write systemcrafters.cc css from scratch, or are you using some kind of framework?
Feb 23 20:17:13 <daviwil>	BigEatie: scratch! 
Feb 23 20:27:31 <BigEatie>	Nice, thinking about trying to make a website myself, I know nothing about it though and wasn't sure which route to go. Definitely thinking about using org-publish, but how did you get it themed up -- the number of classes the exporter outputs seems pretty minimal?
Feb 23 20:27:56 <BigEatie>	Maybe I should just go hugo, seems easier, but somehow your way also seems more rewarding, if for no other reason I learn something.
Feb 23 20:40:28 <shom>	BigEatie: You could check out PicoCSS, it uses html semantic syntax and is quite minimal. If you wanted an out of box solution that wasn't a whole framework, but scratch is also fun! 
Feb 23 20:40:28 <shom>	https://picocss.com/
Feb 23 20:41:51 <daviwil>	BigEatie: I export my own page layout by overriding what Org doe
Feb 23 20:41:54 <daviwil>	Err
Feb 23 20:42:03 <daviwil>	Overriding what ox-html does by default 
Feb 23 20:42:14 <daviwil>	So I'm just styling my own elements 
Feb 23 20:43:11 <BigEatie>	Ahh, gotcha, sounds involved
Feb 23 20:43:23 <BigEatie>	Thanks shom, it looks pretty cool, might give that a try
Feb 23 20:49:30 <daviwil>	BigEatie: its not that bad really, everything I do can be seen in this file: https://codeberg.org/SystemCrafters/systemcrafters-site/src/branch/master/publish.el
Feb 23 20:55:14 <trev>	daviwil: did you eat the grilled meats?

Feb 23 21:29:49 *	Topic for #systemcrafters is: System Crafters General Chat · "where the craven veterans of the net wars shuffle around muttering about ancient RISC hardware while the pretty young things hob knob with the hoi poloi." · https://systemcrafters.net · https://forum.systemcrafters.net
Feb 23 21:29:49 *	Topic for #systemcrafters set by benoitj!a1f51ac63d@user/benoitj (Sat Feb  3 17:13:05 2024)
Feb 23 21:50:52 <Fade>	grilled meats are just for eating
Feb 23 21:53:04 *	BigEatie wonders what other meats are for
Feb 23 21:55:11 <Fade>	I have about three pounds of meat dedicated to thinking
Feb 23 22:05:06 <BigEatie>	Lmao...and once again I'm reminded of the short story....They're made out of meat...
Feb 23 22:18:45 <Fade>	an excellent story
Feb 23 22:30:07 *	benoitj is rofl after finally getting what that 3 pounds of meat was
Feb 23 22:30:41 <Fade>	:D
Feb 23 22:32:59 <sahil_>	Hi, has anyone of you tried thunderbird? It's so cool. I just found out that I can have my IRC, and mail all in a simple and quick to setup interface. :) Except emacs ofcourse.
Feb 23 22:33:20 <Fade>	i use thunderbird for email
Feb 23 22:33:44 <Fade>	before firefox, mozilla was a merged client for web, mail, and news. i didn't know it supported irc.
Feb 23 22:34:00 <sahil_>	Fade: try the chat section as well. It's cool
Feb 23 22:34:43 <sahil_>	all Irc matrix xmpp and another one
Feb 23 22:34:58 <Fade>	huh
Feb 23 22:38:32 <benoitj>	thurderbird?
Feb 23 22:39:59 <benoitj>	Fade: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/instant-messaging-and-chat
Feb 23 22:40:18 <benoitj>	looks like they are still updating that sssoftware
Feb 23 22:40:28 <sahil_>	benoitj: Yes
Feb 23 22:40:50 <benoitj>	glad you're excited about it :)
Feb 23 22:41:19 <benoitj>	I probably was not gandalf the white when I last used thunderbird
Feb 23 22:41:40 <sahil_>	It's simple, quick to setup, and get working, no-strings-attached, that's why I am excited.
Feb 23 22:42:51 <benoitj>	great
Feb 23 22:43:24 <benoitj>	not my cup of coffee, but what ever works for you :)
Feb 23 22:44:35 <benoitj>	I just can't leave emacs. emacs is my home.
Feb 23 22:44:52 <Fade>	i'm quite in favour of weird features in software I otherwise know well. :)
Feb 23 22:45:13 <benoitj>	like doom in excel?
Feb 23 22:45:18 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 23 22:45:41 <Fade>	like a 6502 implementation in minecraft
Feb 23 22:45:48 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 23 22:46:13 <Fade>	all the non-editing software in emacs
Feb 23 22:46:33 <benoitj>	maleable systems
Feb 23 22:47:07 <benoitj>	they tend to enable this weird stuff
Feb 23 22:47:20 <Fade>	yep
Feb 23 22:47:51 <benoitj>	I never thought I would learn something about thunderbird today :P
Feb 23 22:47:55 <Fade>	like 98.7% of the stuff we do with unix
Feb 23 22:48:01 <benoitj>	https://malleable.systems/
Feb 23 22:48:02 <Fade>	way outside the original spec. ;)
Feb 23 22:48:07 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 23 22:48:17 <benoitj>	not really
Feb 23 22:48:18 <Fade>	is it a server? a workstation? a firewall?
Feb 23 22:48:50 <benoitj>	it's architected for the future uses in mind. open, only the right level of decisions made, the rest open to bend at your will
Feb 23 22:51:00 <sahil_>	Hi, I just disconnected :|. I had a question benoitj
Feb 23 22:51:12 <benoitj>	no worries
Feb 23 22:52:03 <benoitj>	what happened?
Feb 23 22:52:07 <sahil_>	I was looking for a powerfull editor and /or IDE for C++, and vim and emacs don't have enough horsepower yet to satisfy me. I was wondering 
Feb 23 22:52:52 <benoitj>	if emacs and vim dont have enough hoursepower...
Feb 23 22:53:01 <sahil_>	wouldn't it be the best text editor (it being one that we would create), which is as extensible as emacs (everything is a buffer), and as fast as vim.
Feb 23 22:53:05 <Fade>	I find that statement surprising in several ways.
Feb 23 22:53:31 <benoitj>	sahil_: to be honest, vim is fast because it does not do much
Feb 23 22:53:50 <sahil_>	benoitj: Yes and that's it's shortcomming
Feb 23 22:54:01 <Fade>	okay, I'm going to have a glass of wine. back later
Feb 23 22:54:04 <benoitj>	emacs, well, it runs an editor, an email reader, an irc client
Feb 23 22:54:10 <benoitj>	Fade: I probably need one early
Feb 23 22:54:26 <Fade>	it's been that kind of day. :)
Feb 23 22:54:31 <benoitj>	sahil_: what do you have in mind?
Feb 23 22:54:41 <sahil_>	A multi-threaded gpu accelerated version of emacs (maybe a rewrite in C++)
Feb 23 22:54:49 <Fade>	LOL
Feb 23 22:54:58 <Fade>	okay, I can't engage this conversation
Feb 23 22:55:08 *	Fade disappears in a puff of logic
Feb 23 22:55:16 <benoitj>	haha
Feb 23 22:55:19 <sahil_>	Fade: Fadeaway then :) (jokin)
Feb 23 22:55:32 <benoitj>	one could do that with cuda
Feb 23 22:55:51 <benoitj>	you could run your editor on a mining rig 
Feb 23 22:56:14 <sahil_>	benoitj: not editor
Feb 23 22:56:28 <sahil_>	More like a homogeneous state machine (fast ofcourse)
Feb 23 22:56:35 <morganw>	sahil_: I can imagine that the more IDE-like a product becomes the harder it would be to customize and extend, so to have the best of both worlds you might end up using two programs.  e.g. use Vim and then a deluxe IDE that can use Vim key bindings.
Feb 23 22:57:08 <sahil_>	morganw: That's what I am arguing against.
Feb 23 22:57:52 <sahil_>	Emacs can have multiple layouts. A minimal one, one with a tree and 10 different windows anywhere, on different monitors etc, all managed by emacs.
Feb 23 22:58:50 <sahil_>	So It's not about it being ide like or not. It's more about speed and (emacslikeness, the extensibility), where everything is a buffer, and different layouts exploit that fact differently.
Feb 23 22:59:31 <sahil_>	It hurts when I scroll with 2-3 inline images, and it starts to lag.
Feb 23 23:01:46 <morganw>	I think some people have bad results when "pixel scrolling" is enabled, as in they made the scrolling smooth but everything becomes very slow, so you might want to check which scrolling modes you are using.
Feb 23 23:02:29 <morganw>	But I don't think there are really any equivalents to Emacs in terms of the design and extensiblity, it is more like running an additional computer than running a program.
Feb 23 23:02:55 <sahil_>	morganw: But one can be made right?
Feb 23 23:02:55 <benoitj>	sahil_: just use lsp and emacs and it's all good. no need to rewrite
Feb 23 23:03:39 <sahil_>	maybe I am speaking from my inexperience.
Feb 23 23:03:58 <sahil_>	Making this argument 4-5 years in future would make more sense
Feb 23 23:04:19 <morganw>	sahil_: People have tried a few times and generally they don't make anything as functional.  I could try Lem, but most of the features which I would class as "extensiblity" are missing.
Feb 23 23:05:00 <morganw>	I think Emacs is 40+ years old so it is asking a lot to make a complete replacement.
Feb 23 23:05:31 <morganw>	*You could try
Feb 23 23:05:51 <sahil_>	morganw: but now foss community is also larger then ever. And it has to be done someday, I believe. 
Feb 23 23:07:14 <sahil_>	take the zed editor for example. In such a short amount of time, just create enough hype, and you got an ecosystem. It's possible for emacs as well.
Feb 23 23:09:32 <fyrfaras>	sahil_: Maybe you could take a look at this?
Feb 23 23:09:35 <fyrfaras>	https://gtoolkit.com/
Feb 23 23:10:23 <fyrfaras>	But I'm not sure if C++ programming would be sufficient in it.
Feb 23 23:11:29 <fyrfaras>	I'm more into interactive programming at the moment :3
Feb 23 23:11:49 <morganw>	sahil_: If you started with a distribution like Doom, it might be best to check whether you have the same performance issues on just plain Emacs.  I've never tried Doom, but I can imagine some of the opinionated settings may favour trying to mimic other programs at the expense of performance.
Feb 23 23:12:02 <fyrfaras>	I need to sleep now. Nini~ everybunny!
Feb 23 23:12:11 <morganw>	fyrfaras: Good night!
Feb 23 23:12:35 <sahil_>	Bye!

Feb 23 23:40:17 *	BigEatie +1s "I just can't leave emacs. emacs is my home."
Feb 23 23:44:36 <BigEatie>	In what ways do you guys find Emacs to be slow? I use it for basically everything, I've never seen it noticeably lagging compared to other editors.
Feb 23 23:45:02 <BigEatie>	MY HOME HAS BEEN INSULTED AND I MUST DEFEND ITS HONOR
Feb 23 23:57:06 <cow_2001>	it often halts completely while things are computing
Feb 23 23:58:18 <cow_2001>	ement.el and the mastodon't client are like that
Feb 24 00:03:47 <cow_2001>	it's just a piece of software.  reasonable criticism is fine
Feb 24 00:13:08 <BigEatie>	Oh, the multithreading issue, yea, that'a fair
Feb 24 00:15:52 <cow_2001>	if i were The Emperor of The Cosmos, i'd put getting better multithreading and subprocessing and all that kind of stuff into GNU Emacs on top priority
Feb 24 00:17:44 <BigEatie>	Plot twist: the cosmos runs on a single thread
Feb 24 00:17:51 <BigEatie>	That's the source of all that quantum weirdness
Feb 24 00:44:34 <benoitj>	BigEatie: dont worry, it sounded almost like a troll
Feb 24 00:45:20 <benoitj>	I mean, Fade ran away, and I kept playing
Feb 24 00:46:21 <benoitj>	but honestly, we would like better concurency / parallelism behavior in emacs. that does not mean I would change emacs to something else inferior
Feb 24 00:49:44 <benoitj>	just discovered my terminal spotify player has support for cover, if I enable them

Feb 24 00:57:00 <BigEatie>	Nice, and also lmao at the shirt
Feb 24 00:57:01 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 24 00:57:04 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 24 00:57:12 <benoitj>	I like mc lars
Feb 24 00:57:31 <benoitj>	this one is "do the bruce campbell"

Feb 24 01:45:39 <benoitj>	talos: oh yeah
Feb 24 01:47:00 <Motaik>	hey guys
Feb 24 01:47:07 <Motaik>	what's up
Feb 24 01:47:08 <benoitj>	BigEatie: lars attack is not bad too
Feb 24 01:47:11 <benoitj>	hi Motaik 
Feb 24 01:47:21 <Motaik>	hello @benoitj
Feb 24 01:47:52 <Motaik>	what yall been up to?
Feb 24 01:48:08 <benoitj>	tonight's been calm. playing some dayz
Feb 24 01:48:21 <benoitj>	about you?
Feb 24 01:48:25 <Motaik>	dayz days. long time no see
Feb 24 01:48:27 <talos>	Thinking of making a archivable and stuff site built on git
Feb 24 01:48:50 <Motaik>	holy cow. its time @talos
Feb 24 01:49:04 <Motaik>	i'm configuring exwm right now
Feb 24 01:49:09 <benoitj>	nice
Feb 24 01:49:13 <talos>	Cool!
Feb 24 01:49:21 <Motaik>	having some troubles with ytb videos on guix
Feb 24 01:49:51 <talos>	I use NixOS but used Guix in the past
Feb 24 01:50:00 <talos>	Maybe I could help, dunno
Feb 24 01:50:35 <benoitj>	which browser is the question
Feb 24 01:50:56 <benoitj>	any browser in guix may have problem
Feb 24 01:51:01 <benoitj>	like the default ones
Feb 24 01:51:28 <Motaik>	yeah, been trying with a few
Feb 24 01:51:34 <Motaik>	but all have some issues
Feb 24 01:51:45 <talos>	Since this channel isn't #guix, I'll say that when I used Guix, I cheated and used Flatpak to get Firefox lol
Feb 24 01:51:57 <Motaik>	hehehe
Feb 24 01:52:04 <Motaik>	im considering it
Feb 24 01:52:13 <benoitj>	on guix, I only used nonguix firefox, and chrome and qutebrowser from nix
Feb 24 01:52:41 <benoitj>	if I recall, the default browsers also add bunch of plugins that break yt and similar sites, need to turn them off
Feb 24 01:53:12 <talos>	Ungoogled Chromium seemed to work with Youtube okay-ish
Feb 24 01:53:29 <Motaik>	i tried icecat, and althought i'm able to play ytb, It is inconsistent 
Feb 24 01:53:36 <Motaik>	some videos work. some dont
Feb 24 01:53:54 <talos>	Probably some codecs are missing
Feb 24 01:54:10 <Motaik>	also, a lot of pages even like github ones dont get displayed correctly
Feb 24 01:54:25 <Motaik>	yeah. been trying to figure which ones if so
Feb 24 01:54:50 <Motaik>	i'm trying vimb right now. But ytb can't play nothing
Feb 24 01:55:15 <Motaik>	saw on the internet that maybe for vimb, it needs GStream lib
Feb 24 01:55:18 <talos>	Yeah, dunno what to do about Github, other than disable stuff like benoitj suggests
Feb 24 01:55:36 <Motaik>	but guix apparently doesnt have gstream
Feb 24 01:55:46 <talos>	Ooh I see
Feb 24 01:56:14 <Motaik>	probably i'll stick with it, and disbale some stuff
Feb 24 01:56:37 <Motaik>	or just go mayhem like @talos and use firefox hehe
Feb 24 01:56:53 <talos>	The only solution I can see other than disabling stuff is to use either Flatpak or enable the Nix system service like benoitj lol
Feb 24 01:57:07 <benoitj>	nonguix works too
Feb 24 01:57:16 <talos>	Oh yeah
Feb 24 01:57:18 <benoitj>	I used firefox from nonguix
Feb 24 01:58:05 <Motaik>	do you guys use firefox as well? I was wondering if exwm can handle multiple tabs like with vimb too
Feb 24 01:59:01 <talos>	I use Firefox practically 99% of the time haha
Feb 24 02:00:07 <Motaik>	fair enough hahah
Feb 24 02:00:25 <Motaik>	perhaps it is the way to go!
Feb 24 02:00:39 <Motaik>	one comment just off topic
Feb 24 02:00:42 <talos>	Mainly for the noscript and ublock origin
Feb 24 02:00:55 <Motaik>	tanking in irc chats is cool!
Feb 24 02:01:00 <Motaik>	talking*
Feb 24 02:01:11 <talos>	I agree!
Feb 24 02:01:34 <Motaik>	@talos thats cool!
Feb 24 02:01:49 <Motaik>	how you guys mark someone here?
Feb 24 02:02:40 <talos>	Mark? As in highlight?
Feb 24 02:02:44 <Motaik>	like, when repling to one person speciffically
Feb 24 02:03:17 <talos>	Oh, in my IRC client I just alt-tab when typing their name
Feb 24 02:03:20 <benoitj>	Motaik: I use qutebrowser from nix, it supports even netflix
Feb 24 02:03:38 <benoitj>	widevine drm
Feb 24 02:03:43 <talos>	Err, just ab
Feb 24 02:03:46 <talos>	*Tab
Feb 24 02:03:50 <Motaik>	sorry, my english is off sometimes
Feb 24 02:03:52 <talos>	No alt required haha
Feb 24 02:03:56 <talos>	It's fine!
Feb 24 02:04:32 <Motaik>	hmm . let me try talos 
Feb 24 02:04:42 <talos>	That worked
Feb 24 02:05:36 <Motaik>	 colol
Feb 24 02:05:38 <Motaik>	cool
Feb 24 02:06:02 <Motaik>	!
Feb 24 02:06:24 <talos>	BRB
Feb 24 02:07:37 <Motaik>	benoitj: i don't have nix configured yet. is it available in nonguix channel?
Feb 24 02:07:50 <benoitj>	nix-service-type, it's core guix :)
Feb 24 02:08:22 <benoitj>	https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Miscellaneous-Services.html
Feb 24 02:09:29 <benoitj>	it's a bit of a race, found a huge military crate, need to bring it 1 meter a second to my base
Feb 24 02:09:43 <benoitj>	and the night is about to come
Feb 24 02:10:09 <Motaik>	benoitj: i'll try it out!
Feb 24 02:10:20 <Motaik>	holly! you can do it!
Feb 24 02:10:21 <benoitj>	works well
Feb 24 02:10:36 <benoitj>	700m from my base
Feb 24 02:10:48 <benoitj>	at least no one sawme
Feb 24 02:11:06 <Motaik>	you got this!
Feb 24 02:11:11 <Motaik>	go my man
Feb 24 02:11:19 <benoitj>	hehe
Feb 24 02:11:54 <Motaik>	and he is the champ!
Feb 24 02:12:44 <benoitj>	i'm actually just a noob, started couple of weeks ago
Feb 24 02:13:06 <benoitj>	takes time to understand all the mecanism and last more than 1 hour before dying
Feb 24 02:14:35 <benoitj>	talos: did you see you can run guix in a flake now?
Feb 24 02:14:57 <benoitj>	talos: https://github.com/mmai/guix-flake
Feb 24 02:15:03 <Motaik>	yeah. I didn't got much further hehe. One i was playing these days is lethal company
Feb 24 02:15:13 <Motaik>	it is so much fun! hahah
Feb 24 02:15:42 <Motaik>	actually i didn't! i never tried nix 
Feb 24 02:16:08 <Motaik>	what is flakes anyway?
Feb 24 02:17:54 <benoitj>	it's similar to guix, actually guix is using a fork of nix build server, I think now it may have diverged, but it's still c code. guix has a really nice language, better developer features with the repl and lisp. nix has a weird language, but still functional (as in FP) and lazy loaded, it has way more packages, and support a real linux kernel, and all the software I need to work
Feb 24 02:18:12 <benoitj>	they are quite similar and different at the same time
Feb 24 02:18:26 <benoitj>	I like both, but I use nix because it gets out of the way
Feb 24 02:19:37 <Motaik>	hmm i see. I was using void on my other machine, and installed the nix package manager
Feb 24 02:19:42 <Motaik>	it is really great
Feb 24 02:19:54 <benoitj>	nix flakes are ever better :D
Feb 24 02:20:13 <Motaik>	nix flakes are like containarized envs?
Feb 24 02:20:15 <benoitj>	makes your system really reproducible, unlike guix, which needs weird hacks to achieve a bit of it
Feb 24 02:20:19 <benoitj>	no
Feb 24 02:20:47 <Motaik>	hmmm. How so?
Feb 24 02:21:29 <Motaik>	i tought guix reproductability was  one of its main features
Feb 24 02:22:02 <Motaik>	my man. I'm having some screen pproblems in this laptop, jesus
Feb 24 02:22:03 <benoitj>	with flakes, you dont have channels anymore, anything out of you git is bad, real bad, and a flake has inputs (nixpkgs, and a lot more), and outputs (a nixosConfiguration for example). it also has to concept of lock file, like npm, so all the versions of all the inputs, and the inputs of inputs are locked, so you can clone that old 2 years old config, and it will still work. for guix, it does not (I know I switch between both every 
Feb 24 02:22:03 <benoitj>	year)
Feb 24 02:23:04 <Motaik>	wow! that neat!
Feb 24 02:23:38 <benoitj>	guix does not have that, you need a channel file in ~/.config/guix/channels.scm and it creates a checkout at a specific version in ~/.cache/guix, so these two things are invisible in you git repo, you can store some of it, but it does not work well when you have more than just guix and non-guix channels (I have 4-5 guix channels in my channels.scm)
Feb 24 02:23:48 <Motaik>	it is one thing i'll like to try. that is, nix and its crazy features
Feb 24 02:25:23 <Motaik>	so, nix enables multiple git repos in one? 
Feb 24 02:25:26 <benoitj>	with nix for example, my fork of dwm is a flake on it's own, and my nixos configuration has my dwm flake as input. works all the time
Feb 24 02:25:29 <benoitj>	no
Feb 24 02:25:44 <benoitj>	it enables tracking your "channels" dependencies with their specific versions
Feb 24 02:25:48 <benoitj>	let me show you, simpler
Feb 24 02:25:52 <Motaik>	hmmm
Feb 24 02:25:54 <Motaik>	okay
Feb 24 02:26:03 <benoitj>	https://git.sr.ht/~benoit/dotfiles/tree/main/item/flake.nix
Feb 24 02:26:13 <benoitj>	https://git.sr.ht/~benoit/dotfiles/tree/main/item/flake.lock
Feb 24 02:26:36 <Motaik>	srry for the lack of knowledge in this matter 
Feb 24 02:26:38 <benoitj>	so, to setup any "new" nix config, I just clone my repo, and switch to it. it will work
Feb 24 02:27:19 <benoitj>	if you see "inputs" these are the equivalent of channels.scm, but it's there, in my config. and the lock file has the specific version of each channels
Feb 24 02:27:38 <benoitj>	so in 10 years, this will still work
Feb 24 02:27:56 <Motaik>	ahhhh
Feb 24 02:27:58 <Motaik>	now i see
Feb 24 02:28:15 <benoitj>	with guix, unless you know tricks, everytime guix update, it has the potential to break your config, so if it sits for a year, it will most likely fail
Feb 24 02:28:57 <benoitj>	for example, during my guix -> nix transition, I had a working guix system, used nix for 1 year, then used my guix config again, and it broke. a software was no longer building in latest nix
Feb 24 02:29:03 <benoitj>	*** err latest guix
Feb 24 02:29:21 <benoitj>	with nix flakes, you dont have that unless you update the flake
Feb 24 02:30:09 <Motaik>	but, even with the generations config for guix, it still updates the config, lets say if you stored that in a separated repo?
Feb 24 02:30:29 <benoitj>	the channels and their version is not stored in your git repo
Feb 24 02:30:40 <benoitj>	the version of nix is hidden in ~/.cache/guix
Feb 24 02:30:47 <benoitj>	it's the actual git clone of the repo
Feb 24 02:31:50 <benoitj>	you can store it using guix describe > channels.scm.lock, and -C channels.scm.lock when guix system switch and so on, but it does not fully work. I keep having issues where code in my own channel does not see the code from nonguix
Feb 24 02:32:09 <benoitj>	plus, you need couple of custom commands to get that to work
Feb 24 02:33:00 <Motaik>	so it demands multiple steps to reproduce something that nix does by default
Feb 24 02:33:10 <Motaik>	sounds like i need to try nix soon
Feb 24 02:33:24 <benoitj>	yes, and you cant reproduced  locking dependencies of your dependencies
Feb 24 02:33:38 <benoitj>	at least not without code
Feb 24 02:34:07 <benoitj>	I havent really looked at it, but it's something that nix users are always missing when going on guix :P
Feb 24 02:34:31 <benoitj>	once you understand and see the benefit, it's hard to go without that feature
Feb 24 02:35:14 <Motaik>	:(  . I say i would need more knowledge to fully understand what you said. But one thing is certain. The more simple things are, i preferer it
Feb 24 02:36:24 <Motaik>	for the moment, the abillity to roll back to previous generations is pretty neat for me
Feb 24 02:36:54 <Motaik>	but i'll try nix out soon! and flake some things up
Feb 24 02:37:03 <benoitj>	oh yeah, that is great
Feb 24 02:37:12 <benoitj>	^ rolling back
Feb 24 02:37:22 <Motaik>	it is!
Feb 24 02:37:44 <Motaik>	it is funny tho
Feb 24 02:38:09 <Motaik>	the more i dive in the linux world. more i discover how little i know
Feb 24 02:38:29 <Motaik>	i see myself trying new things all the time
Feb 24 02:38:34 <benoitj>	dont worry, it wont stop
Feb 24 02:38:38 <Motaik>	yeah ahahah
Feb 24 02:39:22 <benoitj>	been using linux for the past 27 years and I still learn
Feb 24 02:39:47 <Motaik>	wow! thats awesome!
Feb 24 02:39:55 <Motaik>	more time than i'm alive
Feb 24 02:40:10 <benoitj>	I think it's 27, started around 96-98
Feb 24 02:40:17 <benoitj>	wow
Feb 24 02:40:19 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 24 02:40:19 <Motaik>	i'm from 98
Feb 24 02:40:24 <benoitj>	makes me feel old
Feb 24 02:40:29 <Motaik>	nah
Feb 24 02:40:45 <Motaik>	you're just getting better
Feb 24 02:40:47 <benoitj>	i'm 28 for the past many years
Feb 24 02:41:11 <Motaik>	hahaha. What matters is what in your heart
Feb 24 02:41:54 <benoitj>	only way to roll :)
Feb 24 02:42:45 <Motaik>	trues to that
Feb 24 02:44:06 <Motaik>	just to say, thanks for the help
Feb 24 02:44:21 <benoitj>	pleasure
Feb 24 02:44:37 <Motaik>	its great seeing some fellow unix users that are willing to spread the word
Feb 24 02:44:59 <benoitj>	honestly, this community is great for that. everyone's friendly
Feb 24 02:45:40 <Motaik>	yeah! most of the times i had an issue, or just chatted with someone, they've always been so kind
Feb 24 02:46:12 <Motaik>	kindness is at fault sometimes. And I for one appreciate it
Feb 24 02:46:54 <benoitj>	happy bunch of people who like to learn, experiment and share
Feb 24 02:47:30 <Motaik>	it's the way!
Feb 24 02:48:24 <Motaik>	benoitj: i'll leave for now. But will try to connect here around this time in the next days
Feb 24 02:48:32 <Motaik>	it's an honor to meet you
Feb 24 02:48:35 <benoitj>	bye
Feb 24 02:48:41 <benoitj>	have fun with guix
Feb 24 02:48:47 <Motaik>	Will do!

Feb 24 12:19:00 <trev>	hello
Feb 24 12:19:04 <trev>	that doesn't sound very fun
Feb 24 12:25:42 <glenneth>	Hi mretka o/
Feb 24 12:25:55 <glenneth>	teesh3rt: alternateved o/
Feb 24 12:33:13 <trev>	i'm still giggling about the distrobox stream
Feb 24 12:33:32 <trev>	guix is so borked up i want to use it just to feel somethin
Feb 24 12:34:56 <trev>	i'll start streaming too and my name will be High on Guix and every stream will just be me screwing up the system so hard that i have to start over. the running gag will be that i never save my config so i never have reproducible builds
Feb 24 12:36:11 <mretka>	lol
Feb 24 12:36:27 <mretka>	Sounds like yesterday's stream was fun, I couldn't watch it yet
Feb 24 12:36:50 <mretka>	trev yeah, it's as fun as it sounds, not much, but anyway, should be done this morning
Feb 24 12:37:02 <mretka>	Then I'll have some open space in my place
Feb 24 12:37:22 <mretka>	It's the landlord's fridge that I'm returning to them
Feb 24 12:37:43 <mretka>	Because I got another one into the apartment last month, their fridge broke down and couldn't be fixed
Feb 24 12:48:27 <daviwil>	trev: sounds like a good idea to me
Feb 24 13:08:55 <ashraz>	Hello Crafters
Feb 24 13:23:28 <mretka>	Hello ashraz daviwil :)
Feb 24 13:26:15 <trev>	hey ashraz 
Feb 24 13:33:27 <alternateved>	Hi ashraz 
Feb 24 13:33:36 <alternateved>	You were missing yesterday. Missing hard
Feb 24 13:35:52 <ashraz>	Sorry :(
Feb 24 13:36:22 <alternateved>	leftpad went on a rampage
Feb 24 13:37:27 <ashraz>	Heh. I just skipped the start of the video. "Today we're going to look at Distrobox in Guix. It doesn't work... But we're gonna make it work!"
Feb 24 13:37:35 <ashraz>	That's a leftpad line if I ever heard one 
Feb 24 13:37:45 <ashraz>	*leftpad summoning
Feb 24 13:38:19 <alternateved>	:D
Feb 24 13:48:15 <daviwil>	Yes indeed 
Feb 24 13:48:31 <daviwil>	I taunted the Gods and I got what I deserved 
Feb 24 13:48:43 <ashraz>	Still skipping through the stream. 47minutes in: Tetris.
Feb 24 13:49:12 <daviwil>	I'm gonna be a professional Emacs tetris streamer 
Feb 24 13:49:16 <ashraz>	So.... switching tracks into gaming streams?
Feb 24 13:49:35 <ashraz>	Could combine Gaming + Emacs into Emacs CTF Hacking Streams :D
Feb 24 13:51:37 <ashraz>	lol @ M-x doctor. We need a special pattern for "stream" and "error|failure|crash|derail" where the doctor answers: "You should blame leftpad"
Feb 24 13:53:28 <alternateved>	Maybe Gaming With Guix
Feb 24 13:53:59 <alternateved>	Thought it also sounds hellish 
Feb 24 13:54:37 <ashraz>	alternateved: it sounds easier to mount a live system, run takeover.sh, then use said live system to install Debian testing or Fedora and then play games there 😅
Feb 24 13:54:57 <ashraz>	Or does Guix have Flatpak integration?
Feb 24 13:55:33 <alternateved>	Yeah, most likely Steam from Flatpak would work okay
Feb 24 13:55:50 <morganw>	See: https://boilingsteam.com/i-love-arch-but-gnu-guix-is-my-new-distro/
Feb 24 13:56:36 <morganw>	> I have my VR and Steam gaming just as before on Arch.
Feb 24 13:57:14 <ashraz>	Hm... I need to reinstall Linux on my Yoga X390 either way.
Feb 24 13:57:22 <ashraz>	I could actually switch to Guix...
Feb 24 13:58:32 <ashraz>	Background: Tumbleweed worked fine, but one of the Thinkapd Pen Pro buttons wasn't working; neither on the included, nor on the replacement pen. Turns out, Lenovo has a special f****ng app that you need in addition to the Wacom drivers.
Feb 24 13:58:53 <ashraz>	Only available on Windows atm. The second button simply doesn't work with libwacom+libinput.
Feb 24 14:01:20 <theesm>	Good morning folks 
Feb 24 14:01:56 <ashraz>	Hey theesm 
Feb 24 14:02:41 <daviwil>	Yeah, I install Steam via Flatpak on Guix, works fine
Feb 24 14:03:34 <alternateved>	Hi theesm 
Feb 24 14:05:03 <ashraz>	Hm, speaking about games... SystemCrafters Xonotic instagib match when?
Feb 24 14:05:43 <daviwil>	I hadn't heard of that one, and it's in Guix...
Feb 24 14:05:57 <daviwil>	that looks pretty fun, old Quake Arena / UT style
Feb 24 14:07:09 <ashraz>	Exactly
Feb 24 14:08:00 <daviwil>	definitely something worth considering
Feb 24 14:08:03 <ashraz>	It's a fork of Nexuiz, after that one became closed source (and later switched to CryEngine)
Feb 24 14:19:31 <mretka>	lol ashraz 
Feb 24 14:22:19 <mretka>	Lately I'm just playing with Jupyter Notebooks hehe
Feb 24 14:56:34 <daviwil>	xonotic is pretty cool, just launched it
Feb 24 15:15:04 <nm0i>	Sweet, I'm having memory leaks somewhere in emacs...
Feb 24 15:25:30 <talos>	Ugh fine, I'll run a Xonotic server on my own server people here can join :D
Feb 24 15:28:21 <talos>	Good day all
Feb 24 15:28:36 <nm0i>	Morning, talos.
Feb 24 15:44:13 <talos>	Heyo nm0i!
Feb 24 15:50:30 <talos>	OK, Xonotic server anyone can join here is up and running!
Feb 24 15:51:03 <talos>	Search for "Lagrange Point Xonotic server" in the server tab in Xonotic and there ya go~
Feb 24 15:55:59 <ashraz>	Huh
Feb 24 15:56:16 <ashraz>	Was gone for two hours (Secret of Monkey Island 2), will join in a minute
Feb 24 15:56:28 <talos>	Cool~
Feb 24 15:56:44 <talos>	Just lemme know when you're on and I'll join too
Feb 24 15:57:45 <ashraz>	Probably need to update first, my Xonotic folder is from 2017
Feb 24 15:58:01 <talos>	Oh wow, yeah
Feb 24 15:58:28 <daviwil>	I like the idea of organizing the occasional community game session, that would be fun
Feb 24 15:58:52 <talos>	Yeah, agreed
Feb 24 15:58:57 <ashraz>	talos: but IIRC, there was a rsync based updater in there, let me check...
Feb 24 15:59:17 <ashraz>	Ah yeah. misc/tools/rsync-updater/update-to-release.bat
Feb 24 15:59:26 <talos>	Noice~
Feb 24 15:59:41 <ashraz>	talos: did you set any special rules/mods? Or is that classic?
Feb 24 15:59:59 <talos>	No special rules or mods yet lol
Feb 24 16:00:14 <talos>	So yeah, just classic deathmatch for now
Feb 24 16:01:04 <talos>	I would have to look up how to do that from NixOS
Feb 24 16:01:08 <ashraz>	Alright - need to check my name, might be something vaguley ironic like "Weeeeee" (the sound you make when you fly around via hookshot)
Feb 24 16:01:10 <talos>	If you wanted it
Feb 24 16:01:20 <daviwil>	lol
Feb 24 16:01:22 <teesh3rt>	hello!
Feb 24 16:01:28 <talos>	Hiya!
Feb 24 16:01:51 <ashraz>	Should probably set my Xonotic nick to "rightpad"
Feb 24 16:02:08 <daviwil>	yes
Feb 24 16:02:10 <talos>	lol
Feb 24 16:03:17 <talos>	I was also hosting a Minetest server but for some reason it won't generate a world anymore =/
Feb 24 16:03:32 <talos>	SO still need to figure out how to fix that
Feb 24 16:04:46 <tdback>	morning crafters
Feb 24 16:04:51 <ashraz>	Oh !leftpad. I accidentally updated Xonotic while it was running in the background...
Feb 24 16:05:20 <talos>	Oops :X
Feb 24 16:05:21 <daviwil>	oops
Feb 24 16:05:36 <talos>	Morning tdback
Feb 24 16:05:53 <ashraz>	talos: Alright, severname was Lagrange Point something, right?
Feb 24 16:05:55 <talos>	Hope it works ok ashraz
Feb 24 16:06:05 <talos>	Yeah, Lagrange Point
Feb 24 16:06:18 <ashraz>	Uh, 200ms ping
Feb 24 16:06:43 <talos>	Uh oh lol
Feb 24 16:06:47 <ashraz>	time travel dm
Feb 24 16:07:18 <talos>	I have the server located in the US
Feb 24 16:07:24 <talos>	Maybe that's why lol
Feb 24 16:07:40 <talos>	Lemme join right quick
Feb 24 16:08:12 <daviwil>	200ms ping, just enough to get the drop on ashraz
Feb 24 16:08:23 <daviwil>	excuse me, rightpad
Feb 24 16:09:26 <tdback>	A free quake-esk game? Yes please

Feb 24 16:38:02 <nm0i>	A humbling reminder that modern shooters are too easy.
Feb 24 16:38:08 <ashraz>	That was fun
Feb 24 16:38:31 <nm0i>	Ye
Feb 24 16:40:28 <ashraz>	Were all four of us from #systemcrafters, or did we have a random at the end?
Feb 24 16:41:44 <benoitj>	morning folks
Feb 24 16:44:42 <ashraz>	Had a quick look at the server list. Nice to see that exe.pub still exists and is still running
Feb 24 16:44:44 <BigEatie>	Need to get a controller or something...don't think my trackball mouse would be any good for a fps
Feb 24 16:45:13 <ashraz>	BigEatie: What's the issue with a regular mouse?
Feb 24 16:45:46 <benoitj>	ashraz: which game? 
Feb 24 16:46:04 <BigEatie>	Not sure there's an issue with em, just haven't used one in likely 15 years with any regularity
Feb 24 16:46:06 <ashraz>	benoitj: Xonotic. talos has set up a server ("Lagrange Point")
Feb 24 16:46:18 <BigEatie>	And if I'm getting something specifically for gaming, I think I'd get a controller.
Feb 24 16:46:36 <ashraz>	Yeah, but against mouse players you'd have a disadvantage
Feb 24 16:46:52 <ashraz>	Arena shooters don't have aim assist
Feb 24 16:47:03 <BigEatie>	I'm terrible at FPS to begin with...I'd be slightly more last place lol
Feb 24 16:47:11 <ashraz>	Fair enough :D
Feb 24 16:47:17 <benoitj>	OK, will install that
Feb 24 16:48:26 <ashraz>	Have fun. I need to go, a friend of mine moves to New Zealand, so we're having a farewell party.
Feb 24 16:48:54 <nm0i>	Well, I played with talos and ashraz earlier with trackball, didn't feel any issues related to it.
Feb 24 16:49:19 <nm0i>	So maybe try first.
Feb 24 16:54:20 <teesh3rt>	ok i just checked out the xonotic site
Feb 24 16:54:25 <teesh3rt>	looks like a pretty cool game
Feb 24 16:54:27 <teesh3rt>	might try later
Feb 24 16:56:26 <morganw>	Looking at the downloads, you have to download binaries for all 3 platforms? https://xonotic.org/download/
Feb 24 16:57:48 <morganw>	I am downloading to see, but my connection is not fast so it will take 10 minutes.
Feb 24 17:13:43 <morganw>	Is does cover Windows, macOS, and Linux.  It is a bit confusing to know which executable to start.
Feb 24 17:16:05 <BigEatie>	nm0i: interestring, remember not liking it in the past,but it's been probably a decade since I've played, so maybe I'll give it another go
Feb 24 17:18:43 <nm0i>	I just used nix package...
Feb 24 17:18:49 <nm0i>	:)
Feb 24 17:20:30 <morganw>	On Windows there are 3 executables per architecture. https://paste.sr.ht/~mew/d4f8b4569208150cbc81553d90588c3d9b155a41
Feb 24 17:21:13 <morganw>	I guess just try xonotic.exe and presume the simplest name is the correct one.
Feb 24 17:22:13 <teesh3rt>	im installing the game rn, it looks very interesting

Feb 24 17:32:23 <morganw>	I gave it a try and it does seem pretty good, although I never played Quake 3.
Feb 24 17:34:06 <talos>	I'm more used to unreal tournament but I did enjoy quake death match back in the day lol
Feb 24 17:34:24 <teesh3rt>	ok i tried it now, my first time playing anything like it, pretty fun just fragging people
Feb 24 17:34:34 <naokotani>	benoitj: I ended up getting ob-plantuml working. I was trying to use it to export the whole buffer and then realized that its more like org babel tangle
Feb 24 17:44:07 <benoitj>	yeah
Feb 24 17:44:24 <benoitj>	it generates the image in your org as an output
Feb 24 17:49:43 <naokotani>	yeah, very cool. 
Feb 24 17:50:15 <naokotani>	99.9% of bugs are actually caused by me being a goofball
Feb 24 17:51:38 <benoitj>	that is called learning :)
Feb 24 17:55:30 <sahil_>	Hi, I heard that we are running short on graphics programmers?
Feb 24 17:55:49 <sahil_>	Everyone around me is webdev this way or the other (I am in college).
Feb 24 17:56:28 <naokotani>	I think a lot of people do web dev, but there is also a lot of web dev that needs doing
Feb 24 17:57:48 <sahil_>	naokotani: Most of them are frameworkers :)
Feb 24 18:02:35 <benoitj>	not sure I understand his questions and points
Feb 24 18:16:12 <naokotani>	sahil1_: I am in college myself, but most job listing I see in web development seem to expect people to be familiar with one or more frontend frameworks
Feb 24 18:17:35 <sahil1_>	Not to forget leetcode 
Feb 24 18:17:54 <naokotani>	One musn't forget leetcode
Feb 24 18:19:45 <naokotani>	benoitj: if you do my UML assignment for me, I'll be your best friend
Feb 24 18:21:38 <benoitj>	haha, i've done my assignments
Feb 24 18:25:46 <sahil_>	and I wait for the deadlines.
Feb 24 18:25:53 <naokotani>	yes, but have you done /my/ assignments
Feb 24 18:36:30 <benoitj>	my hourly rate is probably too high
Feb 24 18:36:54 <benoitj>	hourly rate on my personal time :)
Feb 24 18:37:33 <sahil_>	Hi, so giving some context on the computer graphics programming again. I want to have a Job in C++, to become good at it, and then become capable enough to a) make my own game, b) make something like a modern emacs ;) c) contribute lifelong to some projects like gimp libreoffice etc.
Feb 24 18:38:11 <benoitj>	good to have objectives
Feb 24 18:38:22 <sahil_>	Once in a libreoffice desing meeting, a Senior Dev said that it's hard to find experienced C++ graphics programmers, and reddit had a similar sentiment.
Feb 24 18:39:03 <sahil_>	I have 2.5 years of my college left, and so plan to become an expert at that. What do you know about it?
Feb 24 18:39:44 <benoitj>	you may want to also expand into rust, which seems to be a good fit / complementary skill
Feb 24 18:41:07 <sahil_>	benoitj: Yes, but I will do that once I know some basics and have built some projects, or else I will waste time just learning language basics over and over. (I can survive C++ for the time being)
Feb 24 18:41:17 <benoitj>	zcool
Feb 24 18:43:41 <naokotani>	I was mostly joking. Acually I am sort of having fun with it
Feb 24 18:44:14 <naokotani>	https://ctrl.vi/i/Vh0ZPahec
Feb 24 18:44:37 <naokotani>	This took me like. idk 2 minutes. better than dealing with draw.io or whatever I was trying to use before
Feb 24 18:44:56 <naokotani>	obviously its very simple, but like I feel like it was pretty easy for having no experience with it
Feb 24 18:50:17 <benoitj>	naokotani: I know :) 
Feb 24 18:50:24 <benoitj>	i was also joking
Feb 24 18:51:42 <naokotani>	has anyone ever noticed/had an issue where insetinga  new line in org src block causes tabs to get added and/or random indentation to occur?
Feb 24 18:58:59 <Fade>	Good Morning
Feb 24 18:59:03 <benoitj>	weird indent yes. I use org edit special usually for larger block
Feb 24 18:59:07 <benoitj>	hey Fade 
Feb 24 19:00:00 <naokotani>	oh i didn't know about edit special. that's really cool thanks
Feb 24 19:00:09 <Fade>	heya benoit
Feb 24 19:01:51 <benoitj>	yeah, it narrow the block and load the right major mode
Feb 24 19:02:02 <benoitj>	Fade: how's everything today?
Feb 24 19:07:01 <Fade>	it has been a busy morning of mostly household chores. 
Feb 24 19:07:08 <Fade>	grocery shopping, cleaning &etc.
Feb 24 19:08:17 <Fade>	now I'm sitting at the machine, and I have about twenty tasks with equal urgency values and I'm seized by indecision. 
Feb 24 19:08:20 <Fade>	:)
Feb 24 19:12:43 <naokotani>	roll d20
Feb 24 19:12:48 <naokotani>	assign each task to a number
Feb 24 19:12:50 <naokotani>	or d12
Feb 24 19:13:09 <naokotani>	or whatever, you said 20, but if it was hyperbole adjust the die
Feb 24 19:13:10 <Fade>	well, now I'm going to be implementing a dice plugin in my irc bot.
Feb 24 19:13:36 <naokotani>	I can see why that would be maximum urgency
Feb 24 19:13:53 <nm0i>	I can roll my dice myself.
Feb 24 19:13:57 *	nm0i rolls 20.
Feb 24 19:13:59 <nm0i>	See?..
Feb 24 19:14:29 <Fade>	I think the value comes when we're all playing pathfinder together in the darkest reaches of the night

Feb 25 02:25:59 <BigEatie>	Anyone play xonotic on EXWM?
Feb 25 03:59:08 <tdback>	Xonotic is quite fun, thanks for the earlier mention talos and ashraz
Feb 25 04:03:05 <benoitj>	morning folks
Feb 25 04:03:16 <benoitj>	looks like xonotic is fun :)
Feb 25 04:40:55 <tdback>	benoitj: indeed it is :)
Feb 25 04:41:17 <tdback>	BigEatie: I play it on bspwm, just throw it into fullscreen and have fun :)
Feb 25 05:16:45 <cow_2001>	turns out citizens of the USA do not own games https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAD5iMe0Xj4
Feb 25 05:44:39 <talos>	Was playing Persona 3 Reload lol
Feb 25 05:45:06 <benoitj>	playing dayz with my daughter
Feb 25 05:45:21 <talos>	Also looking forward to Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
Feb 25 05:45:30 <talos>	Ooh cool
Feb 25 05:46:04 <talos>	Glad I was able to get a Xonotic server running :D
Feb 25 05:53:45 <naokotan1>	Probably won't play much until Shadows of the Erdtree comes out
Feb 25 05:54:29 <daviwil>	naokotan1: I still need to play the base Elden Ring all the way through
Feb 25 05:55:36 <naokotan1>	daviwil: I wish I could say that. I beat the base game about 10 times with different stat combos and then started doing things like daggers only, single weapon, no magic runs
Feb 25 05:55:48 <daviwil>	that's pretty awesome
Feb 25 05:56:04 <naokotan1>	I even did a fat rolling run lol
Feb 25 05:56:26 <daviwil>	that's what I like about the Souls games, the mechanics are so rich that you can play the game 100 different ways and it's still fun
Feb 25 05:56:30 <naokotan1>	Beat the entire game overloaded with a strength no magic build
Feb 25 05:57:11 <naokotan1>	yeah, there is so muchr replayability in that game. Appanretly they are adding 8 new weapon classes, which is a huge increase
Feb 25 05:57:47 <naokotan1>	I played through dark souls 3 twice. I tried ds1, but it just felt too dated even witht he remake
Feb 25 05:58:13 <naokotan1>	Have you played Sekiro at all?
Feb 25 05:58:31 <daviwil>	Dark Souls 1 is so awesome, it's worth playing despite that
Feb 25 05:58:42 <daviwil>	I tried playing Sekiro a few times but never made it that far
Feb 25 05:58:51 <daviwil>	Mainly because I didn't have time to invest in it
Feb 25 05:59:15 <naokotan1>	Yeah thats me right now. I feel like my wife doesn't want me playing games unitl I have a coding job lol
Feb 25 05:59:35 <daviwil>	well, it makes sense!
Feb 25 05:59:52 <daviwil>	but gaming is a good way to take a break from grinding job stuff
Feb 25 06:00:28 <naokotan1>	Yeah. I have an extremely one track mind. I get too invested in one thing and if thats gaming im not being productive
Feb 25 06:01:49 <naokotan1>	nonetheless. I will be putting work on the back burner for a couple weeks when the elden ring dlc comes out
Feb 25 06:02:22 <trev>	and disobey your wife's orders?
Feb 25 06:02:39 <trev>	no gaming for me. had to blast away windows partition to escape it
Feb 25 06:03:58 <daviwil>	I respect that
Feb 25 06:04:35 <daviwil>	I've tried giving up gaming in the past, but what I realized is that I just need to come up with projects that are more interesting than gaming and things become easier to balance
Feb 25 06:06:50 <naokotan1>	I get a lot of gaming peer pressure and its the only way I can really connect with friends back home
Feb 25 06:07:31 <naokotan1>	of coures, that doesn't explain all my diablo 2 resurrected single player hours last fall ol
Feb 25 06:09:05 <cow_2001>	if you're trying to beat up a gaming habit, try cocaine!
Feb 25 06:09:20 <daviwil>	I don't think that's going to help
Feb 25 06:10:32 <naokotan1>	yeah, pretty sure if I did cocaine it would result in my playing videos games all night
Feb 25 06:11:02 <cow_2001>	maybe even give you better attention?
Feb 25 06:11:15 <cow_2001>	is ritalin cocaine-like?
Feb 25 06:11:21 <naokotan1>	sort of
Feb 25 06:11:36 <trev>	naokotan1: i actually have a lot of gaming peer pressure too. hard to give up when you have friends that want to game all the time
Feb 25 06:11:39 <cow_2001>	i really need to go to sleep.  guarding the cat all night is hard
Feb 25 06:11:41 <naokotan1>	I have't had amphetamine
Feb 25 06:11:42 <cow_2001>	injured
Feb 25 06:11:58 <cow_2001>	good night
Feb 25 06:12:24 <trev>	gnite cow_2001 
Feb 25 06:12:33 <talos>	Nite cow_2001
Feb 25 06:13:08 <naokotan1>	I think part of the issue with gaming is that there is profit motive to make it addictive over satisfying
Feb 25 06:13:16 <naokotan1>	similar to social media
Feb 25 06:13:20 <trev>	i've done a one year full no gaming before and it felt good. once i realized how much of a time sink it is, i can't shake the guilt
Feb 25 06:14:39 <naokotan1>	I played a lot of games the last few years. I have been doing night shift for 3.5 years and it was a way to keep me occupied over a long nights 
Feb 25 06:14:42 <trev>	also keep in mind i used to put in like 12 hour shifts of counter strike that would just be during work hours
Feb 25 06:15:20 <naokotan1>	yeah, so my job im not REALLY expected to do much other than be awake all night
Feb 25 06:16:03 <naokotan1>	I go through long periods where I will do a lot of coding, but then the willpower to self start dries up
Feb 25 06:16:06 <trev>	perfect time to learn something useful
Feb 25 06:16:35 <trev>	yep i know that feeling
Feb 25 06:17:14 <naokotan1>	Although recently I found anohter hobby maybe you guys should try, warhammer
Feb 25 06:17:27 <naokotan1>	painting the guys, building the battlefields
Feb 25 06:19:13 <daviwil>	no thanks
Feb 25 06:19:18 <daviwil>	I already use Emacs
Feb 25 06:20:03 <naokotan1>	Warhammer. The other other emacs
Feb 25 06:20:35 <trev>	100% no way LOL
Feb 25 06:21:30 <trev>	i'm more on the side of becoming a forest recluse and building a log cabin instead of that mega-nerd stuff
Feb 25 06:21:56 <naokotan1>	lol
Feb 25 06:21:58 <BigEatie`>	trev: If I had the skills, that'd be my thing too
Feb 25 06:22:01 <trev>	have a friend who paints those guys though :']
Feb 25 06:22:04 <naokotan1>	I don't see it being more nerd than gaming really
Feb 25 06:22:22 <trev>	the artistic part is nice
Feb 25 06:22:23 <naokotan1>	I already built a house in the woods, so I guess im over it
Feb 25 06:22:48 <BigEatie`>	Is there a community of emacs users who build houses in the woods?
Feb 25 06:23:03 <naokotan1>	There is an overlap
Feb 25 06:23:22 <trev>	it's always like that, huh? i think i read something about that, where people who worked trades want to do a tech job and then people who work in tech want to do labor jobs eventually 
Feb 25 06:23:22 <naokotan1>	the people that want to build their editor for scratch probabl also want to do it with their house
Feb 25 06:24:07 <naokotan1>	trev: that's called humans consistently wanting what they don't have
Feb 25 06:24:56 <naokotan1>	aka the three poisons
Feb 25 06:25:03 <naokotan1>	delusion, desire, aversion
Feb 25 06:25:25 <daviwil>	the Buddha's always right
Feb 25 06:25:37 <naokotan1>	idk about always, but he had some real bangers for sure
Feb 25 06:26:33 <naokotan1>	you could make the point that it's a big part of what drives innovation though
Feb 25 06:27:42 <naokotan1>	Why does javadoc want me to comment the main function? It feels like its a bit self evident
Feb 25 06:28:07 <daviwil>	god demands obedience
Feb 25 06:28:26 <naokotan1>	to be fair, its only a warning
Feb 25 06:28:47 <naokotan1>	but im too OCD to leave the warning, so I guess I am going to need to comment hte main function
Feb 25 06:29:13 <naokotan1>	"This is the main function. It's where the magic starts"
Feb 25 06:30:18 <naokotan1>	"This is my main function. There are many like it, but this one is mine."
Feb 25 06:49:09 <naokotan1>	anyone happen to be a javadoc expert?
Feb 25 06:49:57 <trev>	intellij is 
Feb 25 06:50:24 <benoitj>	what do you mean. I work with java for the past 26 years
Feb 25 06:51:14 <benoitj>	naokotani: you dont repeat what the function tells
Feb 25 06:51:36 <naokotan1>	benoitj: you do when that's what the assignment tells you to do
Feb 25 06:51:42 <benoitj>	javadoc is typically only for public exposed libraries. the rest, if it needs javadoc, it's because the code is bad
Feb 25 06:52:35 <naokotan1>	We are supposed to produce a javadoc file, but for some reason when I run javadoc -d doc Main.java it only produces documentation for the Main class
Feb 25 06:52:39 <benoitj>	but you question is "any javadoc expert"
Feb 25 06:52:53 <benoitj>	oh, we never do that. we use maven or gradle to build our javadoc
Feb 25 06:53:30 <benoitj>	javadoc should accept a "classpath" just give it your source folder
Feb 25 06:54:49 <benoitj>	--source-path :)
Feb 25 06:55:58 <benoitj>	man javadoc
Feb 25 06:56:46 <naokotan1>	lol thanks
Feb 25 07:08:51 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 25 07:14:18 <glenneth>	Morning Folx o/
Feb 25 07:16:57 <naokotan1>	Mroning
Feb 25 07:28:27 <naokotan1>	Appanrelty I can get intellij free
Feb 25 07:28:32 <naokotan1>	maybe it can figure out how to do it for me
Feb 25 07:30:02 <glenneth>	Hey naokotan1 :) Intellij?
Feb 25 07:33:40 <glenneth>	It's an IDE?
Feb 25 07:35:04 <trev>	yep for java
Feb 25 07:35:29 <trev>	probably the only way to write java these days since it can do everything for you
Feb 25 07:38:38 <glenneth>	OK.  Hi trev o/
Feb 25 07:38:52 <trev>	hi glenneth. finally a day off for you?
Feb 25 07:39:11 <glenneth>	Yes sir :)
Feb 25 07:43:10 <naokotan1>	I am really not super interested in java, I just have to do it for school so if it can do things for me I am all for it
Feb 25 07:43:30 <naokotan1>	I am sure Java is wonderful, but just doesn't interest me personally
Feb 25 07:47:19 <trev>	it sure is a nice money-maker
Feb 25 07:47:35 <trev>	the businessman's programming language
Feb 25 07:47:50 <trev>	i was java's prisoner for 6.5 years
Feb 25 07:51:02 <naokotan1>	yeah I mean. if someone is crazy enough to give me a job writing java I will do it
Feb 25 07:55:40 <naokotan1>	I will say, I spend a lot of time doing web stuff, and I don't see it being used a crazy amount for that
Feb 25 07:56:02 <naokotan1>	seems like its more, as you say, the business software side of things
Feb 25 08:02:09 <trev>	java webapps are huge
Feb 25 08:02:42 <trev>	i caught the tail end of using JSP stuff 
Feb 25 08:03:08 <trev>	i guess nowadays you can make good money doing some javascrit fullstack
Feb 25 08:04:34 <naokotan1>	yeah
Feb 25 08:04:52 <naokotan1>	I mean, its not that I don't see jobs posted for java, but its just one in the pack it feels like
Feb 25 08:05:01 <naokotan1>	idk, I havne't done a scientific survey or anything
Feb 25 08:06:18 <BigEatie`>	Dating myself here, but I haven't done any Java since the web applet days... All of our HS CS stuff was Java back then.
Feb 25 08:07:35 <BigEatie`>	I think we were using netbeans back then, can't remember
Feb 25 08:08:12 <BigEatie`>	I do remember using it to get around a lot of things that were blocked on the computer though
Feb 25 08:08:50 <BigEatie`>	regedit was disabled, but Java programs were not disabled from editing the registry, lol
Feb 25 08:10:32 <glenneth>	Hey BigEatie` o/
Feb 25 08:10:53 <BigEatie`>	Howdy!
Feb 25 08:11:15 <trev>	BigEatie`: nice! netbeans
Feb 25 08:18:10 <naokotan1>	oohhh baby. it took 30 minutes but if finally downloaded
Feb 25 08:18:14 <naokotan1>	its intellij time 
Feb 25 08:38:47 <naokotan1>	This is going ot actually drive me insane
Feb 25 08:38:58 <naokotan1>	it just refuses to add the classes to the javadoc
Feb 25 08:39:20 <naokotan1>	spending an entire night messing with this was so not on my todo list lol
Feb 25 08:49:50 <glenneth>	 gotta run.  House chores and I have to try and catch up on my homework before the final guile session this afternoon :)  See you all later o7
Feb 25 08:50:52 <trev>	naokotan1: you should just find a popular java project and copy it at this point
Feb 25 08:54:15 <naokotan1>	We are supposed to do this specific one
Feb 25 08:54:50 <naokotan1>	I literally
Feb 25 08:55:20 <naokotan1>	created a new project in intellij, copied overa ll the classes, had it generate the javadoc comments, it runs and works fine
Feb 25 08:55:25 <naokotan1>	I run generate javadoc
Feb 25 08:55:31 <naokotan1>	and its jsut the main class
Feb 25 08:56:10 <trev>	so it's good?
Feb 25 08:56:55 <naokotan1>	no. its documenting only the main class and none of hte other classes and methods. it makes no damn sense. 
Feb 25 09:00:00 <naokotan1>	omg
Feb 25 09:00:20 <naokotan1>	I finally see an error "there is no public class in this file"
Feb 25 09:00:35 <naokotan1>	they code they gave us is undocumentable lol
Feb 25 09:00:40 <naokotan1>	becaues its all private classes
Feb 25 09:01:19 <trev>	lol
Feb 25 09:03:00 <naokotan1>	the assignment is to write javadoc for classes that can't be javadoced. 
Feb 25 09:03:03 <naokotan1>	10/10
Feb 25 09:03:50 <naokotan1>	about as good as my assignemnt that fullfills the course objectives by telling me to find a course that fulfills the course objectives
Feb 25 09:07:51 <naokotan1>	what if then the other course I find simply gives me an assignment that tells me to find a course that fulfills hte course objectives?
Feb 25 09:08:48 <naokotan1>	At what point do I reach Maximum call stack size exceeded?
Feb 25 10:05:45 <daviwil>	phew, just finished the content for the last week of the Guile course
Feb 25 10:07:48 <BigEatie`>	Congrats!
Feb 25 10:08:18 <daviwil>	thanks!  It was a lot of work to produce the whole thing, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out
Feb 25 10:08:24 <daviwil>	lots of areas of improvement though
Feb 25 10:09:33 <BigEatie`>	Yea man, I don't know how you do it at the rate you do, I tried my hand at doing videos and it and it is a ton of work
Feb 25 10:09:58 <BigEatie`>	Looking forward to the next session! Going to sign up.
Feb 25 10:14:17 <mretka>	Congrats daviwil 🎉🎉🎉💪
Feb 25 10:15:53 <trev>	awesome, daviwil! now we can finally afford that yacht you promised to buy us
Feb 25 10:29:28 <daviwil>	trev: lol, I'm never gonna have yacht money teaching about Guile 
Feb 25 10:30:03 <daviwil>	That'll come after I create another scheme: a pyramid scheme 
Feb 25 10:36:25 <trev>	hahaaa!!
Feb 25 10:39:41 <sahil_>	And I moved from DWM to kde.
Feb 25 10:40:11 <sahil_>	Too much extensibility and options were distracting, and I was scripting the whole day there.
Feb 25 10:41:13 <sahil_>	Now I use thunderbird, instead of weechat and neomutt.
Feb 25 10:41:36 <trev>	next stop: MacOS 
Feb 25 10:42:53 <sahil_>	No. Kde is enough. Pacman and aur X Kde == work all day, and don't be a config wizard. 
Feb 25 10:43:55 <sahil_>	And the argument of creating an installer script for the system also falls short, as how often would you change computers? maybe once in 8 months or an year probably.
Feb 25 10:44:10 <trev>	"config wizard" is offensive to "system crafters"
Feb 25 10:44:35 <trev>	haven't changed computers in 7 years actually
Feb 25 10:47:17 <daviwil>	trev: I wouldn't call it offensive, system crafting doesnt necessarily require hand edited configs 
Feb 25 10:48:00 <daviwil>	My deal isn't so much about changing computers but making a reproducible setup across multiple computers since I use 2 or 3 different computers regularly and I want the same setup on all of them
Feb 25 10:49:16 <trev>	i think sahil_ just doesn't want to get stuck in the "ricing" cycle. it can be a seemingly endless journey, like distrohopping for some people
Feb 25 10:51:38 <sahil_>	trev: exactly. I was working on some patches for libreoffice, but my hands always opened that config file in the first tag, and continued to tinker with fzf X tmux X neovim scripts, so that one shortcut would open fzf, and then the selected entry in tmux. 
Feb 25 10:52:12 <sahil_>	I want to get some work done. Configuring all day makes me feel guilty of not working on what is important.
Feb 25 10:55:17 <trev>	haha that script sounds more interesting than libreoffice
Feb 25 10:58:05 <sahil1_>	Not if I tell you that you might be able to customise libreoffice with css after the patch
Feb 25 11:00:46 <trev>	then i'll just be ricing libreoffice! you're trying to make me rice while you're being productive!
Feb 25 11:05:32 <mretka>	lol
Feb 25 11:05:42 *	mretka is ricing Jupyter Notebooks recently
Feb 25 11:13:55 <vii_majesty>	lol
Feb 25 11:22:35 <thanosapollo>	https://0x0.st/H5Ft.png finally figured out how to use iimage lol

Feb 28 02:10:12 <naokotan1>	precisely
Feb 28 02:10:45 <naokotan1>	currently its "my wife debugging" and she doesn't appreciate it

Feb 29 01:45:53 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/uMwYM ]::[ Binary data ]
Feb 29 02:04:37 <moshh>	do people recommend running erc at startup, or manually calling the function?
Feb 29 02:04:46 <cow_2001>	need to meditate.  anyone wanna join?
Feb 29 02:05:16 <purplg>	moshh: i have a seperate configuration dedicated to ERC and a different them so i can tell them apart. It also launches/connects to Matrix
Feb 29 02:05:49 <moshh>	oh okay, do you connect to many channels? I just have 4
Feb 29 02:05:51 <Marvin2>	oh okay, do you write about for your own mind
Feb 29 02:06:19 <purplg>	moshh: not in IRC, no. P much just here
Feb 29 02:07:01 <moshh>	thanks purplg
Feb 29 02:39:33 <benoitj>	moshh: I just run the function on the emacs instance I use to chat
Feb 29 02:50:50 <moshh>	i suppose its not needed to be run constantly
Feb 29 02:52:13 <benoitj>	mine done
Feb 29 02:52:15 <benoitj>	does
Feb 29 02:52:42 <benoitj>	8 days, 11 hours uptime
Feb 29 02:52:46 <benoitj>	:)
Feb 29 02:53:55 <moshh>	oh I turn my computer(s) off haha
Feb 29 02:54:22 <moshh>	I use the sr.ht bouncer though. I'm not really sure why, I guess I was already paying them for the git
Feb 29 02:54:44 <benoitj>	I use it to connect with my phone
Feb 29 02:55:12 <moshh>	?
Feb 29 02:56:07 <tdback>	I've been too lazy to set up the sr.ht bouncer :P
Feb 29 02:56:18 <tdback>	or any bouncer for that matter
Feb 29 02:57:51 <moshh>	one of my big complaints from IRC many (many) years ago when I was in high school and my friends used it, was that I couldn't see chat history. 
Feb 29 02:58:01 <moshh>	so if I'm going to use it, a bouncer is required
Feb 29 02:58:05 <tdback>	that's what I like about it :)
Feb 29 02:58:07 <Marvin2>	that's what you're going after
Feb 29 02:58:31 <moshh>	to each their own haha
Feb 29 02:58:48 <benoitj>	moshh: connecting with irc on the phone is weird, it keep connecting disconnecting. sometimes also fails to connect
Feb 29 02:58:57 <moshh>	I don't see the point unless I can see context; because I'm not going to have it on my screen 24/7
Feb 29 02:58:59 <Marvin2>	I don't trust scheme is I don't use it though.
Feb 29 02:59:03 <benoitj>	this is from my phone
Feb 29 02:59:10 <benoitj>	and here from my desktop
Feb 29 02:59:50 <benoitj>	lots of power outage tonight. lots of wind
Feb 29 02:59:53 <moshh>	benoitj do you have an android? I'm using goguma and it seems to work without issue. Android has power management which might cause the app to disconnect
Feb 29 03:00:00 <benoitj>	yes, goguma
Feb 29 03:00:13 <benoitj>	but I connect it to chat.sr.ht
Feb 29 03:00:29 <moshh>	same. I don't have any issues. I even get pings when needed
Feb 29 03:00:41 <benoitj>	I was talking, one reason to use a bouncer :)
Feb 29 03:00:42 <moshh>	wild how I had trouble with erc, but not goguma, and its vice-versa for you
Feb 29 03:00:53 <benoitj>	I have no issues for both :P
Feb 29 03:01:02 <moshh>	they're great. I can't imagine using IRC without it...
Feb 29 03:01:08 <benoitj>	i'm saying, connecting directly to libera.chat from phone is messy
Feb 29 03:01:20 <benoitj>	with soju and goguma, it's neet
Feb 29 03:01:21 <benoitj>	neat
Feb 29 03:01:29 <moshh>	agree 100%
Feb 29 04:39:41 <glenneth->	Morning Folx :)

Feb 29 06:05:58 <naokotani>	Moncton I could sort of take or leave
Feb 29 06:06:13 <naokotani>	Fredericton is nice
Feb 29 06:06:21 <glenneth>	Hey naokotani trev o/
Feb 29 06:06:45 <benoitj>	I went mostly in the north of NB
Feb 29 06:07:23 <naokotani>	I've never been there. we went ot st john's and fundy national park
Feb 29 06:07:32 <benoitj>	ok
Feb 29 06:07:42 <benoitj>	my cousins used to live in grand falls
Feb 29 06:07:45 <naokotani>	I can recommend fundy national park
Feb 29 06:08:30 <naokotani>	I think the main thing I like about Nova Scotia that people just feel overall less materialistic than Ontario
Feb 29 06:08:33 <naokotani>	more community minded
Feb 29 06:08:50 <benoitj>	nice
Feb 29 06:09:24 <naokotani>	like they have these huge square dances where they do these sort of gaelic dances
Feb 29 06:09:28 <Marvin2>	like they have killed many millions of people
Feb 29 06:09:36 <naokotani>	lol
Feb 29 06:09:46 <benoitj>	that is hell of a dance
Feb 29 06:09:47 <benoitj>	:D
Feb 29 06:09:58 <naokotani>	there is no killing
Feb 29 06:09:59 <glenneth>	WTF Marvin2 ?? 
Feb 29 06:10:05 <naokotani>	they jsut sort of. they play fiddle and bagpipes
Feb 29 06:10:10 <benoitj>	he's drunk again
Feb 29 06:10:13 <naokotani>	and they sort of idk dance around
Feb 29 06:10:31 <naokotani>	anyway, you just don't find that kind of community even on that scale in rural ontario
Feb 29 06:10:50 <glenneth>	That's a caliegh (kaylee)
Feb 29 06:10:55 <benoitj>	sounds nice
Feb 29 06:11:05 <naokotani>	yeah they spell it.... um
Feb 29 06:11:07 <naokotani>	celidh i think
Feb 29 06:11:21 <glenneth>	It is a gaelic thing
Feb 29 06:11:47 <naokotani>	yeah, i was saying earlier ther eare still a decent numbe rof poele that speak gaelic here
Feb 29 06:12:04 <naokotani>	my son's friend ened up going into gaelic immersion school
Feb 29 06:12:18 <glenneth>	cool
Feb 29 06:13:02 <naokotani>	yeah its neat. my grandfather was actually born in scotland, but where he lived no one spoke gaelic for idk
Feb 29 06:13:05 <naokotani>	a very long time
Feb 29 06:13:13 <naokotani>	glasgow
Feb 29 06:13:32 <benoitj>	ok
Feb 29 06:13:35 <glenneth>	OK
Feb 29 06:13:54 <naokotani>	but these people moved from the really rural parts of scotland where they still spoke it in the 19th century and when they got here it was isolated that they kept speaking it
Feb 29 06:14:02 <naokotani>	and then at some point they put a stop to it
Feb 29 06:14:10 <benoitj>	family comes from north of france, but my ancestor died around 1690 :P
Feb 29 06:14:32 <naokotani>	I know a guy who said if he spoke gaelic as a kid in schol they woul dput his hands on a hot stove top
Feb 29 06:14:40 <naokotani>	but he didn't speak english
Feb 29 06:14:58 <naokotani>	he does now obviously
Feb 29 06:16:04 <naokotani>	its like the acadians
Feb 29 06:16:20 <naokotani>	they tried to clamp down on them too, but there was enough of them that it survived
Feb 29 06:18:27 <naokotani>	Actually we have a lot of miqmaq speakers too
Feb 29 06:18:30 <Marvin2>	Actually we have in mind, but you need to care for commits, just git clone the repository, and then was like well, everyone is really neat.
Feb 29 06:18:32 <naokotani>	on teh island
Feb 29 06:18:47 <naokotani>	so we have french, english, gaelic and miqmaq all on a small island. sort of interesting
Feb 29 06:23:13 <naokotani>	I wonder how to handle a unit test for functions that insert into a database
Feb 29 06:23:16 <Marvin2>	I wonder what the compiler bootstrap story looks like.
Feb 29 06:23:35 <naokotani>	I guess I can just remove them before any kind of production scenario
Feb 29 06:23:50 <benoitj>	naokotani: nice mix
Feb 29 06:24:14 <glenneth>	miqmaq?
Feb 29 06:24:36 <naokotani>	It's an indigenous langauge of the people that are native to parts of eastern canada
Feb 29 06:24:44 <naokotani>	mostly nova scotia and new brunswick
Feb 29 06:25:05 <naokotani>	and probably parts of quebec, though don't quot me on that
Feb 29 06:25:18 <glenneth>	Ahhh.  OK, thanks.  TIL :)
Feb 29 06:25:20 <benoitj>	most likely, but the tribes are different
Feb 29 06:25:42 <naokotani>	yeah, different tribes, but im not sure of the boundaries of the broad cultural group
Feb 29 06:26:11 <benoitj>	we do have micmacs in gaspesie looks like
Feb 29 06:26:29 <benoitj>	so, pretty much north of NB
Feb 29 06:26:55 <naokotani>	yeah, I thought probably, further north yo would get into cree and inuit, but i thought region might be miqmaq
Feb 29 06:27:57 <naokotani>	I guess I could make one test that inserts into the database returns the idea, reads from teh data base and tehn deletes all in one go
Feb 29 06:28:04 <naokotani>	returns the ID
Feb 29 06:28:10 <benoitj>	here it's mostly mohawks and abenaquis
Feb 29 06:28:28 <naokotani>	abenaquis? I havne't heard of that group
Feb 29 06:28:48 <benoitj>	they are next to three rivers
Feb 29 06:29:38 <benoitj>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenaki
Feb 29 06:29:40 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/irJqZ ]::[ Abenaki - Wikipedia ]
Feb 29 06:29:45 <benoitj>	not sure how accurate this is
Feb 29 06:30:15 <naokotani>	oh ok its a subgroup of algonquin
Feb 29 06:31:21 <naokotani>	I would love to visit American in like...
Feb 29 06:31:25 <naokotani>	idk maybe around 1300
Feb 29 06:31:35 <naokotani>	1200
Feb 29 06:31:42 <naokotani>	during mayan times
Feb 29 06:31:47 <naokotani>	but also come up and see canada
Feb 29 06:31:56 <naokotani>	and the us
Feb 29 06:35:36 <benoitj>	my family name has Normans roots
Feb 29 06:53:15 <naokotani>	oh neat
Feb 29 07:02:09 <glenneth__>	Test o/
Feb 29 07:03:40 <glenneth>	benoitj: Which irc client do you use in emacs? 
Feb 29 07:10:46 <glenneth->	That was interesting lol
Feb 29 07:10:48 <Marvin2>	That was interesting but mostly a waste of time
Feb 29 07:11:12 <glenneth->	yup :D
Feb 29 07:22:23 <thanosapollon>	I finally set a old thinkpad as a home server with tailscale, serving RSS-bridge and jellyfin 
Feb 29 07:22:25 <Marvin2>	I finally set a old thinkpad as a kid in schol they woul dput his hands on a small ensemble.
Feb 29 07:23:12 <thanosapollon>	Wtf happened to Marvin? 
Feb 29 07:35:37 <glenneth>	Hey thanosapollon o/  Who knows.  Think he's having a meltdown :D
Feb 29 07:36:17 <glenneth>	RSS-bridge for your feeds?
Feb 29 07:36:39 <thanosapollon>	Hey glenneth! What are you scheming for today? :) 
Feb 29 07:37:10 <thanosapollon>	Yeah for my uni site and others like NYT and medscape that do not provide proper RSS 
Feb 29 07:37:18 <thanosapollon>	If any 
Feb 29 07:37:21 <glenneth>	I'm scheming for my finals :)
Feb 29 07:37:34 <thanosapollon>	Finals on what?
Feb 29 07:38:28 <glenneth>	our last exercises for David's course
Feb 29 07:38:57 <glenneth>	Intro to guile scheme
Feb 29 07:39:52 <thanosapollon>	Whats the exercise task?
Feb 29 07:40:00 <thanosapollon>	David's course sounds fun 
Feb 29 07:42:02 <glenneth>	It was fun
Feb 29 07:43:15 <glenneth>	I don't want to give too much away here in case someone wants to take the class
Feb 29 07:43:44 <thanosapollon>	I see, no spoilers xD 
Feb 29 07:43:53 <daviwil>	it's alright to talk about what we did!  wouldn't take away the experience of actually doing it oneself
Feb 29 07:43:55 <Marvin2>	it's alright to talk about it, but otherwise seems fine.
Feb 29 07:44:02 <daviwil>	shut up Marvin
Feb 29 07:44:08 <glenneth>	Don't want to be *THAT* guy lol
Feb 29 07:44:37 <glenneth>	hey daviwil o/
Feb 29 07:44:40 <daviwil>	I'm gearing up to announce the next iteration today, the course page will give a lot of details anyway
Feb 29 07:44:44 <daviwil>	hey glenneth!
Feb 29 07:45:28 <naokotani>	are you doing a show friday?
Feb 29 07:45:33 <daviwil>	Yep
Feb 29 07:45:39 <naokotani>	nice. any ideas?
Feb 29 07:45:53 <daviwil>	possibly about crafting a minimal writing environment in Emacs
Feb 29 07:45:58 <glenneth>	Cool.  And thanks again for the save yesterday daviwil 
Feb 29 07:46:19 <naokotani>	oh thats right up my alley. I use a combo of org and latex in emacs for all my writing
Feb 29 07:46:30 <daviwil>	glenneth: No worries!  In cases like this, I consider it a problem with the material if someone misses a detail like that
Feb 29 07:46:32 <glenneth>	muchly appreciated
Feb 29 07:47:26 <glenneth>	Should have paid more attention :)
Feb 29 07:47:29 <naokotani>	for org thats the main art of my confid that is still to a large extent your emacs from scartch setup
Feb 29 07:48:14 <naokotani>	so i would be interested to hear how your opinion on it has developed over the yeras
Feb 29 07:49:18 <daviwil>	I'm actually going to be trying a few new packages I haven't used before (mostly written by Prot) to build a config for it
Feb 29 07:50:30 <glenneth>	Nice.  Definitely be catching this weeks stream
Feb 29 07:50:35 <naokotani>	oh wow that sounds dope as hell
Feb 29 07:51:05 <glenneth>	insider knowledge lol
Feb 29 07:53:14 <naokotani>	yeah this is like insider trading
Feb 29 07:53:17 <naokotani>	is this even legal?
Feb 29 07:53:43 <daviwil>	no, I'll be sueing all of you next week!
Feb 29 07:53:50 <daviwil>	suing?
Feb 29 07:54:54 <moshh>	oh dear
Feb 29 07:58:22 <BigEatie>	1st rule of scheme club is we don't talk about scheme club?
Feb 29 07:58:35 <glenneth>	HAHA.  I know nothing
Feb 29 07:58:55 <glenneth>	BigEatie: exactly
Feb 29 08:00:15 <glenneth>	brb - Coffee
Feb 29 08:04:12 <naokotani>	I actually talk about scehem club irl quite a bit
Feb 29 08:04:22 <naokotani>	please don't eject me
Feb 29 08:04:55 <moshh>	is it good? I can't afford it at the moment, but thinking of doing it in the future. I've picked up a bit of programming in general but I think a professional course would be really useful
Feb 29 08:07:07 <moshh>	also has anyone else found Rainer's org mode tutorials insanely helpful? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMlp9HUJI3s&list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE&index=23 I've been taking notes like I do with systemcrafters videos and have learnt a lot
Feb 29 08:07:10 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/VBtvU ]::[ OrgMode E05S03: Attachments - YouTube ]
Feb 29 08:12:27 <thanosapollon>	I've stopped taking notes complrtly but thats a nice video series 
Feb 29 08:15:46 <glenneth>	moshh: I've found the gule scheme course to be very good
Feb 29 08:18:25 <glenneth>	s/gule/guile
Feb 29 08:21:09 <thanosapollon>	Will there be a common lisp course daviwil ?
Feb 29 08:21:33 <BigEatie>	Yea, why isn't David teaching the superior lisp!?
Feb 29 08:21:45 <daviwil>	thanosapollon: It's possible, if there's enough demand.  I'd have to spend a bit of time refreshing my CL skills :)
Feb 29 08:21:52 <daviwil>	I'm happy to teach anything people want to learn
Feb 29 08:22:05 <BigEatie>	Lol, I was just trying to start a fight
Feb 29 08:22:29 <daviwil>	I have reached s-enlightenment, all Lisps are created equal :)
Feb 29 08:22:32 <moshh>	learning is good :)
Feb 29 08:26:37 <thanosapollon>	All lisps are awesome, I just want to hack on Nyxt tho 😂 
Feb 29 08:41:58 <glenneth>	thanosapollon: I'm hacking on Nyxt too :)
Feb 29 08:57:51 <trev>	if there is a CL course, be weary of Fade going undercover as a novice and trying to own the teacher
Feb 29 08:58:22 <alternateved>	Morning

Feb 29 09:21:11 <daviwil>	I'm going to sue you for copyright infringement
Feb 29 09:21:20 <daviwil>	I said that yesterday
Feb 29 09:26:28 <glenneth>	is nothing sacred? lol
Feb 29 09:27:01 <daviwil>	apparently not!
Feb 29 09:27:08 <glenneth>	:D
Feb 29 09:27:16 <daviwil>	btw, I sent you a message on the forum :)
Feb 29 09:28:33 <glenneth>	I shall take a look.  Is it my "must try harder" report card? 
Feb 29 09:28:50 <daviwil>	nope!
Feb 29 09:29:09 <daviwil>	I saw you using 'fold' in the code I looked at yesterday, you are trying harder than most :)
Feb 29 09:33:55 <glenneth>	reading the docs and it seemed to make sense when accumulatihg results
Feb 29 09:34:16 <daviwil>	yep, fold is excellent for that.  It's basically a swiss army knife for map/filter operations
Feb 29 09:37:57 <glenneth>	Appeared to be made to measure for that particular task.  And it didn't take too long to figure out its operation
Feb 29 09:38:13 <daviwil>	like I said, you're a natural!
Feb 29 09:39:11 <glenneth>	Read the manual :D
Feb 29 09:40:11 <glenneth>	I appreciate that though daviwil Thank you.  Means a lot
Feb 29 09:40:53 <glenneth>	I actually thought I would be a disaster
Feb 29 09:45:08 <daviwil>	instead of that you became a Scheme hacker
Feb 29 09:50:15 <trev>	and hyprland user
Feb 29 09:53:57 <glenneth>	I definitely feel like a hack :)
Feb 29 09:54:38 <glenneth>	All credit to you daviwil

Feb 29 09:58:39 <daviwil>	alternateved: maybe so :)
Feb 29 09:58:59 <alternateved>	Marvin2 is uncovering your secret schemes

Feb 29 10:04:11 <alternateved>	Haha :D
Feb 29 10:10:45 <glenneth>	re-writing GNU Stow in scheme :D  It's a start
Feb 29 10:12:16 <trev>	that would be actually good
Feb 29 10:12:18 <Marvin2>	that would be able to get people excited about coding and something we could collaborate on to brush up on the bouncer connection. Did you buy that?
Feb 29 10:12:25 <trev>	kill perl with fire
Feb 29 10:12:40 <glenneth>	can't call it stow though.  What about Scheme Stash?
Feb 29 10:12:52 <alternateved>	Great idea
Feb 29 10:13:10 <alternateved>	Please use Chicken for static binaries :D
Feb 29 10:13:33 <trev>	i think the stow devs were actually planning to get rid of the perl code
Feb 29 10:14:21 <alternateved>	Do you have a source?
Feb 29 10:18:56 <trev>	i think it was in that issue we have with steam alternateved 
Feb 29 10:19:05 <trev>	maybe i was just randomly clicking through their issues though
Feb 29 10:19:07 <Marvin2>	maybe i was just trying to debug erc
Feb 29 10:19:10 <alternateved>	Ah, I see
Feb 29 10:19:17 <trev>	i can find it in a bit, if it's not that issue on GH
Feb 29 10:19:17 <alternateved>	Were you trying to debug erc?
Feb 29 10:19:31 <alternateved>	Do you remember date by chance?
Feb 29 10:19:54 <alternateved>	I think rough date of that statement would be enough for me :D
Feb 29 10:26:18 <glenneth>	I have this already  https://0x0.st/HRwc.txt just changed stow to stash.  That's what We are going with :D

Feb 29 11:09:00 <glenneth>	aspiers is the maintainer of stow?
Feb 29 11:09:25 <alternateved>	Seems so
Feb 29 11:13:01 <glenneth>	So he has "a lot of experience with pytnon", thinks it should be re-written in python, but wants someone else to do it?  That sound about right?
Feb 29 11:13:03 <Marvin2>	So he has "a lot of people are lazy and selfish here
Feb 29 11:13:50 <glenneth>	Easy now Marvin2 , that's enough!

Feb 29 15:40:36 <nm0i>	I sometimes use epistonianmaid and mixstral, but those are heavy.

Feb 29 15:43:18 <nm0i>	sonya was a good generic purpose model as well... But really llms develop so quickly you should re-check "what is good" every two weeks or so.
Feb 29 15:45:17 <fyrfaras>	OIC, I have only scratched the surface of this whole topic. Maybe those fossy models will decrease my doubt or even disdain of LLMs :D
Feb 29 15:45:39 <nm0i>	You can just stick with the things ollama gives you.
Feb 29 15:45:55 <nm0i>	They curate a list of models.
Feb 29 15:52:58 <fyrfaras>	Are those models performance heavy?

Feb 29 19:09:48 <thanosapollon>	Lol, just read it on elfeed. Its funny seeing anyone mention yeetube 😂 glad that some find it useful like I do
Feb 29 19:09:58 <thanosapollon>	Did you try it tho?
Feb 29 19:19:22 <Keman99>	YeeTube sounds certainly interesting, I currently use a bash script for YouTube search and play in mpv ^^
Feb 29 19:21:51 <daviwil>	thanosapollon: nah I haven't tried it, I do all my YouTube watching on the phone 
Feb 29 19:22:05 <Fade>	ditto
Feb 29 19:23:11 <Fade>	overall, how do you guys value RSS support in an information source?
Feb 29 19:23:19 <Fade>	high, low, indifferent?
Feb 29 19:24:06 <thanosapollon>	I mostly use it to play & save music, lectures, podcasts etc. I first made it to download videos tho
Feb 29 19:24:14 <thanosapollon>	HIGH
Feb 29 19:24:32 <Fade>	i've been thinking about adding RSS support into Marvin's URL indexer
Feb 29 19:24:43 <thanosapollon>	I self host rss bridge and scrape everything I need
Feb 29 19:24:46 <Fade>	votes?
Feb 29 19:25:25 <Keman99>	RSS is always good :-)
Feb 29 19:25:33 <thanosapollon>	+1
Feb 29 19:26:17 <Fade>	All I remember about RSS is that it's some XML based format
Feb 29 19:26:24 <Fade>	so I've got some reading to do.
Feb 29 19:27:08 <thanosapollon>	You can also do it with json nowadays 
Feb 29 19:28:14 <Fade>	frankly, XML is probably simpler on the generation side
Feb 29 19:28:18 <Fade>	but I'll see what's what.

Feb 29 20:25:02 <morganw>	> <moshh> do people recommend running erc at startup, or manually calling the function?
Feb 29 20:25:02 <morganw>	One thing to bear in mind is that the directory you are in when calling an ERC connection function will become the default directory for ERC buffers, and that can accidentally put your ERC buffers in scope for commands like project-kill-buffers.
Feb 29 20:48:59 <trev>	BigEatie: is it flycheck?
Feb 29 20:52:49 <thanosapollo>	morganw I usually have a dedicated emacs for erc telega etc.  Why would you call erc on startup? 
Feb 29 20:52:52 <Marvin2>	morganw I usually have a direct need, I tend to like strong dynamic typing is very satisfying but it's a weird timing thing, on first emacs load, I have my tshirt and spring jacket. siping since Scotch while the fire is ready
Feb 29 21:00:14 <BigEatie>	trev: Don't think so, I didn't have it enabled. I think it's related to edebug, was running it earlier, but thought it should have gone away
Feb 29 21:01:00 <morganw>	thanosapollo: I guess because you either don't have a bouncer (and might want to run ERC in the Emacs daemon) or because you forget to connect it manually.

Mar 01 04:22:04 <Marvin2>	need to have the perception that it's around that time
Mar 01 04:22:31 <benoitj>	for ci/cd, let me send you a link
Mar 01 04:22:40 <benoitj>	you want your project build to use nix?
Mar 01 04:22:50 <benoitj>	I think my sr.ht build for my blog is using nix
Mar 01 04:22:55 <shom>	Need to start perceiving Marvin's triggers hahaha 
Mar 01 04:24:36 <benoitj>	my blog does have a shell.nix, but that is not my ci
Mar 01 04:24:38 <Marvin2>	my blog ci/cd
Mar 01 04:24:42 <shom>	Yeah, I also use sr.ht for my emacs - ox-hugo - Hugo - sr.ht pages deploy. I was using an alpine image but had to swap over to Ubuntu (heavy!) because I needed to hold back on emacs version. 
Mar 01 04:25:06 <benoitj>	it's using alpine right now, but I im pretty sure I had one
Mar 01 04:25:46 <shom>	Yeah, I want to pin versions so it doesn't unexpectedly break.

Mar 01 04:31:15 <talos>	I have a risc v board but I haven't gotten much use outta it 
Mar 01 04:31:32 <benoitj>	and build.sr.ht supports nix flakes
Mar 01 04:31:34 <benoitj>	it's in the doc

Mar 01 04:38:13 <benoitj>	show, now I want to update my hugo build with nix...
Mar 01 04:38:20 <benoitj>	it's using alpine right now

Mar 01 04:59:00 <shom>	Sorry I dropped out for a bit. Thanks for the link benoitj 
Mar 01 04:59:51 <shom>	Yeah, I want to go the flake route with build.sr.ht. Should be fun to play around!
Mar 01 05:01:07 <benoitj>	yeah :)
Mar 01 05:01:39 <shom>	talos: do you have an application in mind for your RISC-V board? Now that old x86 NUCs are so cheap and SBCs are so expensive, it's a really weird time for positioning low power devices. 
Mar 01 05:03:19 <benoitj>	shom: I think it works :P
Mar 01 05:04:01 <shom>	I have a whole fleet of NUCs that I bought at an auction with grand goals clustering but haven't gotten around to it. The power draw isn't too bad but my desktop CPU already has so many cores/threads 🤷🏽‍♂️ I'm sure I'll eventually find time to play around.

Mar 01 05:32:46 <glenneth>	Hi benoitj :)
Mar 01 05:33:14 <naokotani>	and it's pretty nice for migrations. it has a little CLI and run diesel migration redo -all and it will drop and recreate all of your tables in one go
Mar 01 05:34:30 <benoitj>	no... dont drop
Mar 01 05:34:35 <benoitj>	that is dangerous
Mar 01 05:34:45 <naokotani>	how so?
Mar 01 05:35:24 <benoitj>	you run this locally often enough, then you get used to it, you're ssh to your prod server, and you run this command until you found out you're not on you local
Mar 01 05:35:29 <benoitj>	worst nightmare
Mar 01 05:35:35 <naokotani>	yeah
Mar 01 05:35:37 <naokotani>	tbh
Mar 01 05:35:44 <naokotani>	that was going to be my next comment
Mar 01 05:35:50 <naokotani>	its great unitl yo udo it by accident
Mar 01 05:36:46 <naokotani>	I have actually been thinking about ways to elimate that
Mar 01 05:37:34 <benoitj>	if you need this for testing, then it's better to have that as part of your test suite setup which would never run with a real db
Mar 01 05:37:43 <benoitj>	at least this is one approach
Mar 01 05:38:17 <benoitj>	or you deploy postgres in a container with compose, and locally you compose down to delete the whole db
Mar 01 05:38:20 <naokotani>	well. the thing is it's run with migration files and if the drop tables don't exist int he production migration files then it won't do it
Mar 01 05:38:24 <benoitj>	and you dont use compose on the server
Mar 01 05:38:56 <benoitj>	you just woke up some trauma :D

Mar 01 06:19:07 <glenneth>	Should have tried sooner though.  Enjoying it so much
Mar 01 06:19:09 <Marvin2>	Should have said "borrowed" heh
Mar 01 06:20:13 <naokotani>	glenneth: This is me. I found out in my mid 30s that my favorite thing in the world is coding
Mar 01 06:20:27 <naokotani>	which is funny because I had always liked computer stuff, but I had never tried it
Mar 01 06:21:25 <naokotani>	I blame my mother for not threatening to disown me for doing an arts degree
Mar 01 06:21:44 <cow_2001>	can you draw?!
Mar 01 06:21:58 <trev>	glenneth: you had to put down the abacus first
Mar 01 06:21:59 <glenneth>	You can add 20 years to that statement naokotani :D
Mar 01 06:22:22 <glenneth>	That's true trev lol
Mar 01 06:22:22 <naokotani>	glenneth: ok now I feel a lot better
Mar 01 06:22:51 <cow_2001>	trev: have you seen the japanese using abacuses?  they become calculators
Mar 01 06:23:07 <naokotani>	aren't the originally for China?
Mar 01 06:23:11 <cow_2001>	trev: they don't even need it
Mar 01 06:23:15 <naokotani>	from*
Mar 01 06:23:26 <glenneth>	haha.  Glad I couid make you feel better.  Already a good day :)
Mar 01 06:24:00 <trev>	cow_2001: no but i can imagine. they always master everything
Mar 01 06:24:04 <cow_2001>	naokotani: the chinese ones have extra beads for hexa based measures or somesuch
Mar 01 06:24:27 <naokotani>	apparnelty they were found earlier in west asia it seems
Mar 01 06:24:41 <cow_2001>	trev: it's just a matter of spending your evenings at an after school course without socialisation.  no biggie!
Mar 01 06:24:44 <Marvin2>	trev: it's just fair to get off the romans tbh
Mar 01 06:24:49 <trev>	lol
Mar 01 06:25:51 <glenneth>	didn't they use base12 or was that the Babylonians?
Mar 01 06:26:13 <naokotani>	base 60 appanretly
Mar 01 06:26:21 <glenneth>	brb - coffee
Mar 01 06:26:27 <naokotani>	the sumerians, and by extesion likely the babylonians
Mar 01 06:26:52 <BigEatie>	David made it look easy, but this whole creating a website thing in pure org is a lot harder than I thought it would be.
Mar 01 06:27:17 <cow_2001>	just use dthompson's haunt ~_~
Mar 01 06:27:20 <naokotani>	I was too lazy and just made a noder server for my org website
Mar 01 06:28:18 <naokotani>	that reminds me
Mar 01 06:28:23 <cow_2001>	i think there's a new version of haunt
Mar 01 06:28:36 <BigEatie>	Don't know scheme lol
Mar 01 06:28:42 <naokotani>	that reminds me. I had inteded to make something to turn the org html into proper html5
Mar 01 06:29:01 <BigEatie>	This is a good exercise in doing some pragmatic elisp, but I'm not sure this will be a usable site. Might try something like ox-hugo

Mar 01 06:30:15 <naokotani>	check out how I did it. i am pretty happy with it
Mar 01 06:30:37 <naokotani>	I just export the body and then use javascript for the rest
Mar 01 06:30:52 <naokotani>	turns out javascript is pretty good website stuff
Mar 01 06:30:58 <glenneth>	Hey BigEatie o/
Mar 01 06:31:01 <naokotani>	good for*
Mar 01 06:31:30 <naokotani>	I would like to add something to add images though
Mar 01 06:32:13 <glenneth>	I can highly recommend daviwil Scheme course BigEatie :)
Mar 01 06:33:32 <daviwil>	BigEatie: it is pretty tricky to be honest, the SC site is the result of a lot of experimentation and refinement and it's still kinda janky :) 
Mar 01 06:33:52 <daviwil>	But I'm pretty happy with it, I've reproduced the model across a few sites now
Mar 01 06:34:51 <glenneth>	daviwil: is the Candyman.  Speak his name and he appears :D
Mar 01 06:35:37 <daviwil>	Hey, when I see my name while I'm eating Corn Flakes, I can use a good distraction :) 
Mar 01 06:35:39 <Marvin2>	Hey, when I was defeated when they got here it was like a playoff game.
Mar 01 06:36:06 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 01 06:36:13 <naokotani>	wait, no froasted flakes? what are you a monk?
Mar 01 06:36:17 *	daviwil smacks Marvin2 with a printed copy of the Lisp HyperSpec
Mar 01 06:36:43 <glenneth>	That's gotta hurt!
Mar 01 06:36:59 *	naokotani smacks daviwil with a box of count chocula

Mar 01 06:37:23 <daviwil>	Sugar for breakfast? No thanks! 
Mar 01 06:38:35 <naokotani>	gives you that little boost you need to get productive on answering emails straight away after breakfast
Mar 01 06:39:26 <BigEatie>	Not sure if there's a more idiomatic way to get around the cross-project linking issue, this is probably a pretty cavemanish way to do it, but it seems to work: https://0x0.st/HRDp.txt

Mar 01 06:45:45 <trev>	the next one is still beginner right?

Mar 01 07:34:51 <shom>	Yay, glad I could help daviwil! 
Mar 01 07:34:53 <daviwil>	It'll be free for the community
Mar 01 07:35:49 <shom>	daviwil: a full sourcehut stack for System Crafters or the bouncer? 
Mar 01 07:36:06 <daviwil>	nah, just the bouncer
Mar 01 07:36:35 <daviwil>	though I am seeing the value of having some kind of Git forge, especially for course work
Mar 01 07:36:37 <Marvin2>	though I don't use it though.
Mar 01 07:36:44 <daviwil>	tell us more, Marvin
Mar 01 07:39:01 <shom>	daviwil: when forgejo has federation working, I think that would be cool to host for System Crafters for things like crafted emacs, etc. 
Mar 01 07:39:03 <Marvin2>	daviwil: when forgejo has federation working, I think that's me, but my desktop CPU already has so many wonderful southern folks over the world
Mar 01 07:39:20 <shom>	Not saying it's necessary, just fun
Mar 01 07:39:26 <daviwil>	yeah, it could be fun
Mar 01 07:39:50 <shom>	Hahaha southern folks in CPUs
Mar 01 07:40:20 <glenneth>	Is that CPU drawl? lol

Mar 01 07:41:59 <shom>	Y'all spinning threads about them CPUs down there? 
Mar 01 07:42:08 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 01 07:43:26 <daviwil>	I can just hear that in my head
Mar 01 07:48:10 <trev>	are you from the south shom?
Mar 01 07:49:59 <shom>	No, I live in central Illinois USA, we're almost the south around here. I also spent a good bit of time working with clients in Kentucky. How about you? 
Mar 01 07:50:43 <trev>	i'm from CT
Mar 01 07:51:36 <daviwil>	I grew up in Mississippi so I think I can safely claim to be the most southern
Mar 01 07:51:50 <trev>	jackson?
Mar 01 07:52:09 <daviwil>	nah, Jackson is too civilized to be where I grew up
Mar 01 07:52:18 <trev>	biloxi blues
Mar 01 07:52:52 <daviwil>	small town in northeast MS near Columbus
Mar 01 07:53:23 <trev>	i just watched a video on the poorest parts of MS
Mar 01 07:53:50 <daviwil>	plenty of those
Mar 01 07:54:10 <daviwil>	plenty of poor places in MS, I mean
Mar 01 07:54:12 <Marvin2>	plenty of poor places in MS, I mean get it working benoitj 👏🏽
Mar 01 07:54:22 <BigEatie>	Houston Tx!
Mar 01 07:54:43 <daviwil>	Texas is pretty cool
Mar 01 07:55:10 <daviwil>	I've only been to DFW area though
Mar 01 07:55:36 <BigEatie>	Yea, I miss it -- I think we're further south than Jackson (though not sure if Tx is part of "the south")
Mar 01 07:56:09 <daviwil>	Texas is the California of the south
Mar 01 07:56:25 <daviwil>	meaning, it has its own culture
Mar 01 07:56:35 <daviwil>	California is west coast, but only California is California
Mar 01 07:56:45 <BigEatie>	Fair enough

Mar 01 07:59:58 <BigEatie>	Thanks
Mar 01 08:00:32 <BigEatie>	Yea, I think I'm at that age where the question-mark is more appropriate than the exclamation haha
Mar 01 08:01:15 <daviwil>	I just turned 41 so you've still got some time left to feel young ;)

Mar 01 08:03:36 <BigEatie>	Oh I definitely still feel young daviwil, my soul is still 15. But my teenager will let me know I'm old whenever she can lol
Mar 01 08:11:38 <daviwil>	shom: I pulled something in my back yesterday while sitting in a chair and it still hurts 
Mar 01 08:11:53 <daviwil>	I also dislocated my shoulder while sleeping earlier this week 
Mar 01 08:11:55 <daviwil>	Fun times! 
Mar 01 08:13:43 <shom>	Woah dislocated in sleep!!! I have new fears now. No wonder I'm procrastinating on sleeping. 
Mar 01 08:14:09 <daviwil>	My shoulder gets dislocated like once or twice a year so I can't lame that one on being 41
Mar 01 08:14:12 <Marvin2>	My shoulder while sleeping earlier this week

Mar 01 08:46:00 <glenneth>	hey alternateved 
Mar 01 08:47:44 <naokotani>	After working at IRL jobs for 20 years 25 yeras on a computer sounds great to me
Mar 01 08:48:09 <naokotani>	though im sure after 6 months ill be ready to smash my computer into a billion pieces
Mar 01 08:49:20 <trev>	hobbyist computing is awesome. i
Mar 01 08:49:48 <trev>	i would sit here for 25 years if i didn't have to "work"
Mar 01 08:50:39 <glenneth>	Guys.  Sell me on evil mode.
Mar 01 08:51:20 <naokotani>	Perhpas working is the heart of the issue then
Mar 01 08:51:27 <trev>	you already use it glenneth 
Mar 01 08:51:49 <naokotani>	The only thing worse than working is not working
Mar 01 08:52:04 <naokotani>	if I didn't have to work id lose touch with reality
Mar 01 08:53:18 <glenneth>	No.  I tried the crafted emacs evil config but it borked my mu4e config
Mar 01 08:54:04 <trev>	oh wow i thought you resolved that
Mar 01 08:54:25 <naokotani>	I had a long work vacation and my wife and son went away for a while to Ontario and I was like what to do today... I know! same as yesterday. I will play diablo 2 for 12 hours
Mar 01 08:54:30 <glenneth>	I did manually apply a fix, when i restarted emacs it was still broken
Mar 01 08:55:37 <naokotani>	If I had an ounce of self respect id use mu4e again. I just use the browser app
Mar 01 08:56:06 <glenneth>	I didn't really understand the code at the time, but now I know a little bit more, thought I would try again
Mar 01 08:56:13 <naokotani>	the problem with the browser app is it does everything I need and works quite well
Mar 01 08:56:17 <Marvin2>	the problem with the integrated shells, but did anyone come? Did they told us to handle a unit test for functions that insert into a pastebin?
Mar 01 08:56:29 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 01 08:56:52 <naokotani>	oh no! not unit tests for functions that insert into a pastebin!
Mar 01 08:56:56 <naokotani>	those are the hardest to test
Mar 01 08:56:57 <glenneth>	Marvin2: on the mushrooms again
Mar 01 08:57:46 <naokotani>	The reason I like Marvin2 is he is like fun house mirror reflection of my own stupidity
Mar 01 08:59:42 <naokotani>	wait
Mar 01 08:59:43 <trev>	glenneth: i just spent a few weeks using emacs bindings. they are fine once i adjusted a few things to act more like vim (ex. jumping words). i think if i stuck with it i would have no problem
Mar 01 09:00:18 <naokotani>	with those apple vision glasses would I be able to have my emacs on them so I don't need to use a crappy laptop screen
Mar 01 09:01:51 <trev>	naokotani: you feeling ill?
Mar 01 09:01:58 <glenneth>	I used doom emacs for a long time so really had no choice, really paid no attention TBH.  Using vanilla bindings rn 
Mar 01 09:03:11 <trev>	glenneth: i could imagine that regular emacs bindings are better for writing, where vim may be better for editing code
Mar 01 09:03:22 <alternateved>	Vanilla bindings are okay if you are using ergonomic keyboard
Mar 01 09:03:33 <glenneth>	trev: stop him now!!! He's getting apple fever
Mar 01 09:04:34 <glenneth>	thanks folx
Mar 01 09:04:58 <trev>	oh yeah if you have multiple layers on your keyboard you could probably make a nice layout
Mar 01 09:06:09 <alternateved>	Homerow mods made a huge difference for me
Mar 01 09:07:44 <naokotani>	trev: just brain storming
Mar 01 09:08:58 <naokotani>	I think the main reason vim keybinds are good is how widely available vim mods are for many things
Mar 01 09:09:01 <trev>	probably costs more than a laptop with a decent screen
Mar 01 09:09:08 <naokotani>	pretty much every code editor, browsers, you name it
Mar 01 09:09:36 <naokotani>	not to mention vim is standard on most systems so you have a viable way to edit text everywhere
Mar 01 09:10:45 <naokotani>	its practically a text editing specification really
Mar 01 09:18:43 <glenneth>	isn't the vision pro like 3500 USD?
Mar 01 09:20:52 <naokotani>	for now yeah, im sure it will come downt to like 2000 USD in no time
Mar 01 09:33:26 <trev>	could get an insane computer for that much
Mar 01 09:33:29 <Marvin2>	could get an Akai MPK Mini lately, didn't get to the collection.
Mar 01 09:37:32 <naokotani>	speaking of which, I need an insane computer
Mar 01 09:37:44 <naokotani>	mine is such a hodge podge of random parts
Mar 01 09:38:05 <naokotani>	it keeps randomly freezing and idk if its the hardware or windows
Mar 01 09:39:59 <trev>	could be from all the anime you keep downloading
Mar 01 09:42:19 <naokotani>	I have no idea. I look through the event logs and there are no errors I can find causing it
Mar 01 09:42:59 <naokotani>	but there seems to be a correlation with some changes to microsoft gameinput, which is some kind of intentional virus youc an't remove
Mar 01 10:02:20 <alternateved>	Try pronouncing M-x out loud.
Mar 01 10:02:49 <vii_majesty>	emacs?

Mar 01 11:38:26 <alternateved>	My wrists hurt when using non-split keyboards
Mar 01 11:40:12 <alternateved>	I honestly don't see a point in using non-split/staggered/unibody keyboards for my use case

Mar 01 11:40:58 <alternateved>	Marvin2: we all do
Mar 01 11:41:33 <alternateved>	trev: I prefer split keyboards with thumb clusters
Mar 01 11:41:48 <alternateved>	You could experiment with combos 
Mar 01 11:41:57 <trev>	i think that will be my next journey 
Mar 01 11:42:14 <theesm>	Good morning folks 
Mar 01 11:42:17 <alternateved>	I also don't like having keys like enter, backspace, escape etc. on outer columns
Mar 01 11:42:29 <alternateved>	this is one of the reasons why my wrists hurt

Mar 01 11:43:10 <trev>	hi theesm 
Mar 01 11:43:47 <trev>	i dont usually have wrist pain. i do the thumb thing to reach win/alt and that causes me pain
Mar 01 11:44:57 <trev>	on my new board i moved them towards the center so i don't have to reach so far
Mar 01 11:45:31 <alternateved>	I have mods on homerow, so no reaching for me :D
Mar 01 11:45:49 <alternateved>	trev: I have, unfortunately. That's why I use split boards with tenting
Mar 01 11:48:10 <trev>	does that mean you use tap/hold for those home keys?
Mar 01 11:48:12 <Marvin2>	does that mean you use in intellij and vscode

Mar 01 12:20:20 <alternateved>	Month, maybe? Maybe more to truly get comfortable with that
Mar 01 12:20:22 <Marvin2>	Month, maybe? Maybe more to truly get comfortable with them on much
Mar 01 12:20:46 <alternateved>	The problem with homerow mods is that you have to relearn how to type unfortunetely
Mar 01 12:20:48 <Marvin2>	The problem with the things ollama gives you.
Mar 01 12:21:02 <alternateved>	Marvin2 please, let me finish
Mar 01 12:21:45 <alternateved>	So you have to type with swift taps otherwise your input might be interpreted as hold functionality
Mar 01 12:22:13 <alternateved>	also, there is a time period where you tweak your tapping term and other configurations etc. 
Mar 01 12:22:56 <alternateved>	For ZMK there is a config which proposes timerless homerow configuration: https://github.com/urob/zmk-config?tab=readme-ov-file#timeless-homerow-mods
Mar 01 12:22:59 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/CxwFS ]::[ GitHub - urob/zmk-config: Personal ZMK firmware configuration for various boards (34-keys, Corneish Zen, Planck) ]
Mar 01 12:23:22 <alternateved>	But I noticed that it doesn't work well with Emacs as modifiers are often chained
Mar 01 12:23:47 <trev>	i am using qmk
Mar 01 12:24:10 <alternateved>	For QMK there is this configuration: https://sunaku.github.io/home-row-mods.html
Mar 01 12:24:12 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/kTJDM ]::[ Taming home row mods with bilateral combinations - The Terminal Programmer ]
Mar 01 12:24:18 <trev>	that's pretty interesting. i don't type well in general, so i think i would have a hard time with it
Mar 01 12:24:25 <alternateved>	it pretty much should do the same thing
Mar 01 12:24:27 <trev>	thanks i'
Mar 01 12:24:33 <trev>	i will take a look
Mar 01 12:24:39 <alternateved>	I also don't type well
Mar 01 12:25:41 <alternateved>	I'm a slow typer, I've learned to touch type pretty late in my life
Mar 01 12:57:57 <trev>	reading that blog, some people are really interested in typing! giant flow chart on there lol
Mar 01 13:00:33 <alternateved>	Haha, you bet

Mar 01 14:22:38 <benoitj>	morning
Mar 01 14:22:45 <daviwil>	hey benoitj
Mar 01 14:22:58 <benoitj>	 hi daviwil 
Mar 01 14:26:28 <benoitj>	need coffee
Mar 01 14:26:30 <nm0i>	Morning
Mar 01 14:27:05 <benoitj>	hi nm0i 
Mar 01 14:32:28 <benoitj>	26 seconds to my coffee
Mar 01 14:35:39 <trev>	i need more thank coffee right now
Mar 01 14:35:42 <Marvin2>	i need to call out my job like that with rust too
Mar 01 14:38:21 <benoitj>	trev: two coffee? i'm having a double shot espresso :P
Mar 01 14:40:49 <daviwil>	Discourse API is annoying
Mar 01 14:41:12 <daviwil>	apparently you can't send an invite to someone to join a forum group if they're already a member of the forum
Mar 01 14:41:27 <benoitj>	oh
Mar 01 14:41:34 <daviwil>	so I've gotta catch this case, look up the group, look up the user, add the user to the group, then send them an invite directly to the topic where I want them to land
Mar 01 14:41:52 <daviwil>	too many extra steps just because their API doesn't let me say "invite them anyway"
Mar 01 14:42:27 <daviwil>	someone registered for the course and the invite webhook didn't work for some reason, and this turned out to be the reason!
Mar 01 14:42:41 <benoitj>	ah
Mar 01 14:42:47 <benoitj>	sounds like fun :)
Mar 01 14:43:00 <daviwil>	yeah, not exactly how I wanted to spend my afternoon, but I want this to work :)
Mar 01 14:43:03 <benoitj>	some APIs dont make much sense
Mar 01 14:43:30 <benoitj>	this is missing a facade API, to abstract some common use cases like this
Mar 01 14:44:18 <daviwil>	Looks like I'll have to implement my own invite logic and send an e-mail my own way
Mar 01 14:44:19 <benoitj>	but it does make sense to build a REST API this way
Mar 01 14:44:53 <benoitj>	resource driven, there is no such thing as actions "invite or add to group"
Mar 01 14:45:02 <daviwil>	yeah
Mar 01 15:07:31 <talos>	Good day Crafters

Mar 01 19:04:31 <benoitj>	I could not attend anyway, but I did not even realize there was one
Mar 01 19:04:45 <benoitj>	minimal writing environment. finished 1 minute ago
Mar 01 19:05:51 <beanpuck>	i caught the last 30 seconds where he mentioned this server :D
Mar 01 19:06:26 <benoitj>	I probably could xonotic tonight
Mar 01 19:08:21 <naokotani>	trev: I finally got a job interview
Mar 01 19:08:49 <trev>	naokotani: awesome!
Mar 01 19:09:17 <naokotani>	Yeah fingers crossed
Mar 01 19:09:24 <naokotani>	"lamp" stack stuff
Mar 01 19:10:29 <naokotani>	I guess I was able to make the case that my lnps stack is close enough
Mar 01 19:10:31 <Marvin2>	I guess I was switching buffers but they started a dedicated emacs for erc telega etc. Why would you call erc on startup?
Mar 01 19:12:53 <benoitj>	naokotani: congrats
Mar 01 19:14:02 <Fade>	naokotani: good luck!
Mar 01 19:17:22 <shom>	Welcome beanpuck 
Mar 01 19:17:31 <beanpuck>	o/
Mar 01 19:17:40 <trev>	LAMP stack is oldskool
Mar 01 19:18:07 <shom>	Congrats naokotani what's the position responsible for? 
Mar 01 19:18:07 <Fade>	oldskool is bestskool.
Mar 01 19:18:09 <dazage>	LAMP is the bee's knees
Mar 01 19:18:21 <beanpuck>	tried and true
Mar 01 19:18:43 <benoitj>	beanpuck: welcome
Mar 01 19:18:47 <shom>	LAMP is how I got properly comfortable with Linux, I think. 
Mar 01 19:18:49 <Marvin2>	LAMP is the default)
Mar 01 19:19:22 <shom>	hahaha I don't like that Marvin2 is starting to make sense. 
Mar 01 19:19:43 <Fade>	it's good for you.
Mar 01 19:19:49 <Fade>	(just go with it)
Mar 01 19:19:51 <dazage>	Linux Nginx NOSQL NodeJS -> LNNN
Mar 01 19:20:04 <Fade>	nosql :((
Mar 01 19:20:07 <dazage>	replace Linux with Nutanix and you got yourself a 4N stack
Mar 01 19:20:20 <Fade>	also, node
Mar 01 19:20:23 <shom>	Fade: not a complaint, uncanny valley here we come! 
Mar 01 19:20:51 <Fade>	(throw 'abstraction-boundary-violation-error)
Mar 01 19:20:56 <benoitj>	Fade: about your clojure vector comments. not really. what they built is all collections implement the Collection java interface, and they have a Seq constructor which is a "protocol" that implements first, rest, and cons, the core type of features of lisp lists
Mar 01 19:21:19 <benoitj>	so instead of storing everything in cons cells, everything expose something that looks like cons cells
Mar 01 19:21:20 <Fade>	ah, k. I knew there was nuance that I wasn't converying. thanks!
Mar 01 19:21:49 <benoitj>	you can effectively play with everything, including maps, as "cons cells" using the seq protocol.
Mar 01 19:21:52 <Fade>	s/eryi/eyi
Mar 01 19:22:39 <benoitj>	also all functional collection manipulation high order functions play with seqs, so map, reduce, filter, etc. are implemented once for all data structures, even ones not yet implemented or invented
Mar 01 19:22:40 <Fade>	does clojure have car and cdr and the extensions to them?
Mar 01 19:22:57 <benoitj>	first and rest is the equivalent
Mar 01 19:23:18 <Fade>	(cadar 'my-deep-seq)
Mar 01 19:23:24 <benoitj>	(first '(1 2 3))
Mar 01 19:23:26 <benoitj>	this is 1
Mar 01 19:23:39 <benoitj>	cadar, not sure what it does
Mar 01 19:23:40 <Fade>	sure. cl has these synonyms, too.
Mar 01 19:23:44 <naokotani>	yeah ive been dong linix nginx postres and react/svelte/rust/node/htmx in the last few months
Mar 01 19:23:46 <Marvin2>	yeah ive been dong linix nginx postres and react/svelte/rust/node/htmx in the series Raft, has a decent numbe rof poele that speak gaelic here
Mar 01 19:24:19 <trev>	dong linix??
Mar 01 19:24:28 <naokotani>	Linux
Mar 01 19:24:30 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 01 19:24:38 <benoitj>	Fade: in clojure, these are the car / cdr
Mar 01 19:24:43 <Fade>	the car/cdr features in CL can be extended by addint 'a and 'd between the c and the r in the functions.
Mar 01 19:24:52 <Fade>	they're all discreet, but they're specified in the standard.
Mar 01 19:24:56 <naokotani>	I know nginx can serve php, but I havne't really delved into that too deeply (or at all)
Mar 01 19:25:01 <Fade>	this might not even make sense in clojure.
Mar 01 19:25:24 <benoitj>	yeah, since they rely on an abstraction of seq, they dont need extension
Mar 01 19:25:36 <benoitj>	no polymorphic trick needed
Mar 01 19:25:42 <trev>	david said clojure isn't real during the stream
Mar 01 19:25:42 <Fade>	sounds like operations on large lists might be N+1
Mar 01 19:25:52 <naokotani>	Currently reading about it as paw patrol blasts in my face because appanretly every day is now a snow day
Mar 01 19:26:02 <saboto>	cloujure can't use tail-call optmization, because the JVM doesn't support it
Mar 01 19:26:15 <Fade>	I vew clojure as a 'real' lisp that is in fact a subset of common lisp.
Mar 01 19:26:22 <benoitj>	Fade: the O notation performance are in the same order as their non-persistent implementations
Mar 01 19:26:29 <Fade>	its implementation is unorthodox due to the runtime it was built on.
Mar 01 19:26:42 <Fade>	benoitj: *nod*
Mar 01 19:26:53 <benoitj>	yeah, but also, because they rely on the seq abstraction, it makes a lot of stuff so nice
Mar 01 19:27:56 <benoitj>	to more I discuss with you, I think clojure has fixed immutability, some of the concurency and data structure challenges, while introduced some complexity by depending on a hosted runtime
Mar 01 19:28:29 <benoitj>	** challenges of CL
Mar 01 19:29:22 <Fade>	rich really went to town on the immutable datastructures
Mar 01 19:29:23 <benoitj>	for example, if you want to convert a string to an integer, you have to call the java function (Integer/parseInt "123")
Mar 01 19:29:29 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 01 19:29:31 <Fade>	software transactional memory was inspired.
Mar 01 19:29:37 <benoitj>	ok
Mar 01 19:29:47 <Fade>	by which I mean a brilliant idea.
Mar 01 19:30:12 <benoitj>	another big advantage, it can be made invisible in a corporate environment. this can be launched from a java app :P
Mar 01 19:30:32 <benoitj>	my next "java" rules engine might actually be written in clojure

Mar 02 04:31:14 <benoitj>	they sent you another invite?
Mar 02 04:33:24 <naokotani>	yes. I waited and then I got a call and he gave some long winded explanation about something came up important to his business
Mar 02 04:34:03 <benoitj>	that could happen
Mar 02 04:34:06 <Marvin2>	that could be done.
Mar 02 04:34:09 <benoitj>	they called you
Mar 02 04:34:44 <naokotani>	Yeah, shit happens.
Mar 02 04:36:00 <trev>	naokotani: no worries, just keep applying
Mar 02 04:36:52 <naokotani>	yeah I am going to apply to another one tonoght. that is based in my local city. jr developer for mongo/node/react stuff
Mar 02 04:37:38 <glenneth>	I'm doing OK thanks benoitj :)

Mar 02 04:41:31 <glenneth>	all good naokotani Sorry to hear about your interview
Mar 02 04:42:08 <naokotani>	I am sure I will find something eventually. The issue with jobs is mostly hte anxiety related to feeding my family
Mar 02 04:42:10 <Marvin2>	I am clearly doing something wrong but I assume that requires a c compiler? idk
Mar 02 04:44:20 <glenneth>	I'm sure you will too.  
Mar 02 04:54:46 <naokotani>	So what scheme projects do you have in mind?
Mar 02 04:54:49 <Marvin2>	So what scheme projects do you like man in the end. Oh, how I long for it"
Mar 02 05:27:38 <naokotani>	I can't believe the added nothing to d2r seasons 6
Mar 02 05:27:41 <naokotani>	two seasons in a row
Mar 02 05:27:57 <naokotani>	I guess people are supposed to play the flaming pile of junk diablo 4
Mar 02 05:32:58 <glenneth>	Sorry naokotani Was on a call.  Me? Scheme projects?
Mar 02 05:33:06 <glenneth>	d2r?
Mar 02 05:34:28 <naokotani>	Aren't you taking the scheme course?
Mar 02 05:34:45 <naokotani>	d2r is diablo 2: resurrected. its a remake of a popular game from around 2000
Mar 02 05:35:35 <glenneth>	Yeah.  Was the final week last week.  Still working on the final exercises.
Mar 02 05:36:49 <naokotani>	Thought you might have some ideas for stuff you wanted to build with it
Mar 02 05:37:09 <glenneth>	I have it in mind to write a scheme version of GNU Stow
Mar 02 05:39:05 <glenneth>	Call it Scheme Stash :)
Mar 02 05:39:38 <naokotani>	man
Mar 02 05:39:47 <naokotani>	funny, IW as trying to remember what stow was called the other day
Mar 02 05:40:02 <naokotani>	I use it for my dotfiles and I haven't updated them in ages

Mar 02 05:58:55 <BigEatie>	Most of the themes I see don't seem to support ERC

Mar 02 06:01:20 <Marvin2>	hey BigEatie o/
Mar 02 06:04:14 <BigEatie>	Yea, doom is one of the nice packages that covers ERC.
Mar 02 06:07:33 <naokotani>	You know I am a fiend when I decide its time to take a break from work and that's messing with prot packags
Mar 02 06:09:27 <glenneth>	lol

Mar 02 06:17:12 <naokotani>	I liked one of the themes I saw daviwil scroll past on stream today
Mar 02 06:22:24 <glenneth>	the ef themes?
Mar 02 06:23:19 <naokotani>	yeah
Mar 02 06:23:26 <naokotani>	I've been using modus for a year or so
Mar 02 06:23:37 <naokotani>	been feeling like chaning it but nothing caught my eye
Mar 02 06:23:56 <naokotani>	the problem with modus themes is they are very easy to read
Mar 02 06:23:58 <Marvin2>	the problem is reuse, you find a javascript developer who is trevin? :D
Mar 02 06:24:23 <naokotani>	its lke
Mar 02 06:24:33 <glenneth>	I used the dark spacemacs theme for a while.  Quite iliked it 
Mar 02 06:24:42 <naokotani>	ok. I need a theme that looks nice AND goes well with my ghost in the shell backgrounds
Mar 02 06:26:09 <naokotani>	oh yeaht aht looks pretty cool
Mar 02 06:32:22 <trev>	hahah marvin greets now!!
Mar 02 07:13:47 <trev>	glenneth: how's it going? doing some scheme or stuck doing real work?
Mar 02 07:18:40 <naokotani>	He is going to make a scheme version of gnu stow
Mar 02 07:24:13 <trev>	all in one weekend?
Mar 02 07:26:33 <naokotani>	pretty sure that's his plan yeah
Mar 02 07:27:30 <naokotani>	I think next weekend he is going to rewrite the GCC compiler in Scheme so he needs to get Stow out of the way this weekend
Mar 02 07:28:46 <trev>	dang i wish i had goals
Mar 02 07:28:48 <BigEatie>	Who are we talking about?
Mar 02 07:29:11 <trev>	you, BigEatie 
Mar 02 07:30:04 <daviwil>	Big goal! 
Mar 02 07:30:08 <naokotani>	BigEatie: Don't listen to him, we are talking about glenneth 
Mar 02 07:31:51 <naokotani>	This job requires familiarity with Mac
Mar 02 07:32:02 <naokotani>	what does that entail? click on teh picture of this thing you want to do?
Mar 02 07:32:28 <glenneth>	Hi trev *REAL* work unfortunately
Mar 02 07:33:09 <naokotani>	Speaking of real work, I was talking to my wife the other day how we really need to find a crab/lobster boat this summer
Mar 02 07:33:23 <naokotani>	they rake in some seroius dough
Mar 02 07:33:58 <naokotani>	Maybe if I do crab and lobster fishing I can fund my software develoopment habit
Mar 02 07:34:12 <glenneth>	Sureiy they are easy to find.  Large floaty things that live on water
Mar 02 07:34:15 <Marvin2>	Sureiy they are very easy to read widely and make it hard to

Mar 02 08:54:36 <naokotani>	oh I figured out why they are using a static &str here. so obvious
Mar 02 08:55:07 <naokotani>	its because its going straight into the database so theres no reason it needs to be mutable
Mar 02 09:35:26 <trev>	naokotani: who is doing that? it's usually because they will handle the copying underneath the api level 
Mar 02 09:35:28 <Marvin2>	naokotani: who is trevin? :D

Mar 02 09:37:47 <trev>	naokotani: don't forget that 'static is not always the entire life of the program. the compiler can find a way to verify that the lifetime is "long enough"

Mar 02 11:51:43 *	mretka is watching yesterday's stream
Mar 02 11:52:17 <glenneth>	cool.  Just reading it now.  Interesting
Mar 02 11:52:49 <mretka>	Lately I'm munching on the idea of having an Emacs instance as a disposable scratchpad on my computer, it's proving to be quite useful at work
Mar 02 11:53:54 <mretka>	I like having a scratchpad (a digital notepad) around to toss whatever is in my head at work at the moment or copy/paste code
Mar 02 11:54:21 <mretka>	That idea came from here: https://tot.rocks/, and here: https://daringfireball.net/2020/02/tot
Mar 02 11:54:24 <Marvin2>	[ https://tot.rocks/, ]::[ Couldn't fetch this page. ]
Mar 02 11:54:26 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/DVMuC ]::[ Daring Fireball: Tot ]
Mar 02 11:56:49 <mretka>	The trick is to keep that scratchpad window on top of all the others and make some space for it in the screen's real estate.I think that would work better with tiling window managers
Mar 02 11:56:52 <Marvin2>	The trick is to learn ansible.
Mar 02 12:04:42 <glenneth>	Apologies mretka I had to take a call.  You use an emacsclient as your scratchpad?
Mar 02 12:04:57 <glenneth>	Need coffee, brb
Mar 02 12:08:03 <trev>	nm0i: hahah did you ask AI about this chat?
Mar 02 12:08:25 <nm0i>	I use summarize prompt in ellama
Mar 02 12:09:26 <trev>	it didn't mention me?
Mar 02 12:09:30 <trev>	that hurts 
Mar 02 12:09:49 <nm0i>	It still insists you don't exists, but there is someone called trevin.
Mar 02 12:19:40 <naokotani>	trev: its the suggested code for this ORM
Mar 02 12:20:18 <naokotani>	its not actually static. It's its &'a &str where a is the struct
Mar 02 12:20:51 <naokotani>	so I build the struct, enter it one for one into the database and then the struct goes out of scope
Mar 02 12:22:03 <naokotani>	then I have a seperate struct that is used when the data comes out, but it uses Strings and inlcudes the table primary key
Mar 02 12:22:07 <Marvin2>	then I have no idea Rust Rover was a hard-realtime application. I doubt clojure could have used an additional three weeks ago. Deadline is Next Tuesday. We could collaborate on to brush up on Emacs version.
Mar 02 12:23:49 <naokotani>	I'm not entirely sure why, but my guess is it can be allocated to the stack this way
Mar 02 12:25:32 <trev>	naokotani: yeah it's coming from io so it can't be a reference 
Mar 02 12:27:14 <naokotani>	On the way out?
Mar 02 12:27:44 <naokotani>	Now. the question is.... if I have to serialize json to get these values, can I use a reference
Mar 02 12:28:03 <naokotani>	I guess I'd have to look at all the serde stuff
Mar 02 12:28:47 <naokotani>	I guess it makes sense that it can be a reference to the json. 
Mar 02 12:29:32 <naokotani>	or the query string perhaps, anyway some form of http plain text
Mar 02 12:29:36 <trev>	naokotani: short answer is "no"
Mar 02 12:29:43 <trev>	needs to be owned when deserviali
Mar 02 12:29:48 <trev>	deserializing
Mar 02 12:30:08 <trev>	still not used to my new keyboard 😞
Mar 02 12:31:20 <naokotani>	yeah because I guess if it were a reference to the http plain text it would rely on the life time of the json itself
Mar 02 12:32:03 <mretka>	glenneth: No, I actually bring up another Emacs instance rather than emacsclient
Mar 02 12:32:18 <mretka>	It makes it easier to separate frames and switch to them IMO
Mar 02 12:33:11 <naokotani>	hmmm. I think this is probably more work than its worth to copy a handful of strings
Mar 02 12:33:20 <naokotani>	to avoid copy*
Mar 02 12:43:16 <naokotani>	Now that I think about it, another short answer is could be if it doesn't know how long it needs to be at compile time, it needs to be a String
Mar 02 12:44:00 <naokotani>	because the stack memory neesd to be allocated at compile time
Mar 02 13:09:43 <trev>	naokotani: String is heap allocated so yeah

Mar 02 18:21:22 <trev>	is this part of the CL vs clojure debate?
Mar 02 18:21:25 <Marvin2>	is this part of building a toy like this.
Mar 02 18:21:43 <benoitj>	trev: is there a debate? we're sharing cool features of each languages
Mar 02 18:23:40 <daviwil>	Is that using a transducer or something that only iterates on demand? 
Mar 02 18:23:46 <trev>	it's always a debate when CL's dignity is on the line
Mar 02 18:25:40 <benoitj>	daviwil: not transducers here, just lazy sequences, the "cons cells" in clojure is an abstraction called seq, and many of the sequence functions like map, filter, and so on use lazy seq, which returns the recipe to realize the data, without evaluating it. map does it by chunk, if you try to take one value, i'll compute 32 values to make things efficient
Mar 02 18:25:43 <Marvin2>	daviwil: not transducers here, just lazy sequences, the "cons cells" in clojure
Mar 02 18:25:58 <benoitj>	haha
Mar 02 18:26:09 <daviwil>	Gotcha, I forgot about the seq mechanics 
Mar 02 18:26:20 <daviwil>	It's been a long time since I Clojured

Mar 02 18:26:56 <benoitj>	:D
Mar 02 18:27:52 <benoitj>	like in the example below, if by mistake I print that value in the repl, it'll print forever
Mar 02 18:28:38 <benoitj>	transducers are ways to combine processing streams that can act on collections, seqs, but also on discrete values
Mar 02 18:28:40 <Marvin2>	transducers are ways to elimate that
Mar 02 18:28:57 <benoitj>	not sure where this is coming :P

Mar 02 18:39:41 <Marvin2>	daviwil: it's rough for a 'plain passphrase'
Mar 02 18:40:19 <daviwil>	I agree 
Mar 02 18:44:33 <benoitj>	we tried to get technical writers to write our guidelines, did not work well :P
Mar 02 18:44:49 <benoitj>	ended up taking more time, and we still had to do it

Mar 02 19:21:49 <Fade>	man, you blink and a lot happens around here. :)
Mar 02 19:22:21 <Fade>	so when you take the car of a seq in clojure, it yields a lambda that produces the next value?
Mar 02 19:22:26 <Fade>	they're generators?
Mar 02 19:25:27 <Fade>	although I guess there's probably machinery in the JVM to iteratively produce the values on some delayed schedule. they're probably not literally lambdas...
Mar 02 19:25:52 <Fade>	is this idiom used for, say, network servers?

Mar 03 10:51:29 <sebastiant>	... migrating from projectile and perspective to project.el im finding it hard to track currently active project. Any advice?
Mar 03 10:52:10 <sebastiant>	Sort of expected there to be built in mode-line support
Mar 03 10:56:28 <glenneth->	Thanks trev Opened it up, just on my way out grocery shopping.  I'll check it when I get back 
Mar 03 10:57:57 <daviwil>	sebastiant: You could add something like this to your configuration: https://0x0.st/H7Z8.txt
Mar 03 10:58:02 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/fIgBK ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 03 10:58:24 <daviwil>	that's very basic, probably needs some polish
Mar 03 11:03:23 <sebastiant>	Thanks! Another thing that surprised me was the logic in project-switch-project. I would have expected it to open last visited buffer of selected project. Maybe im mixing my expectations up a bit since removing perspective, but do you use that default behaviour or are there popular alternatives?
Mar 03 11:03:41 <glenneth>	I also need to close down znc 
Mar 03 11:06:16 <daviwil>	sebastiant: You can add any project behavior switching you like by taking a look at project-switch-commands, you can set it to the symbol for a function that decides what to do when you switch projects.  You'd probably need some logic to keep track of hte last open buffer of the given project, not sure of the best way to get that.  I normally just set `project-switch-project` to `magit-status` or something like thta
Mar 03 11:10:35 <sebastiant>	Cheers!
Mar 03 12:40:10 <trev>	quiet sunday
Mar 03 12:47:40 <daviwil>	everybody left us, trev
Mar 03 12:48:40 <trev>	i finally get a few minutes to sit down and i can't think of what to do
Mar 03 12:48:43 <Marvin2>	i finally set a old thinkpad as a project manager
Mar 03 12:49:00 <daviwil>	you'll never be alone when marvin is here to say something dumb
Mar 03 12:49:08 <trev>	hahah
Mar 03 12:49:27 <trev>	i can hear the disdain in your voice
Mar 03 12:53:24 <trev>	daviwil: did you get the PC parts yet?
Mar 03 12:55:55 <daviwil>	nah, I"m waiting to set up a business in Greece so I can expense it all correctly
Mar 03 13:05:28 <tonyab>	I finally got around to following emacs from scratch series (old one, been lazy lol) and seems general.el is now "deprecated", and maybe on its way out of peoples dotfiles.  There isn't a systemcrafters video on that is there?  Was it mainly used to make leader keys etc. for hydra usage?
Mar 03 13:10:40 <daviwil>	tonyab: Hadn't heard about general.el being deprecated, but I guess it's due to the new keymap functionality in Emacs?
Mar 03 13:10:50 <daviwil>	I don't have a video on that yet, but it's a good idea for sure
Mar 03 13:13:17 <tonyab>	Nice. Well the maintainer is calling it "deprecated" tongue in cheek as in maybe bloated but stable I guess.  I just noticed it seems like scouring peoples configs it also seems like maybe people found a faster way to achieve what they used to with general.el.  I guess the new keymap functionality in emacs is maybe the ticket for people?  Or I
Mar 03 13:13:18 <tonyab>	just can't find general.el in people's configs randomly.
Mar 03 13:13:18 <trev>	bind-keys macro seems pretty powerful to me. i saw general.el as something that is more useful for evil-mode. didn't fully read the manuals though
Mar 03 13:13:20 <Marvin2>	just can't find the originally Sherri in a tree, and then make a power tool free for nerds to run whatever in place
Mar 03 13:13:21 <Marvin2>	Nice. Well the maintainer of stow?
Mar 03 13:15:01 <tonyab>	Hmm I meant the maintainer of general.el, can't tell if you are referring to me seems we all sent messages at the exact same time
Mar 03 13:15:10 <tonyab>	He's splitting general.el into like 10 packages
Mar 03 13:15:45 <daviwil>	tonyab: Marvin2 is a bot, ignore him :)
Mar 03 13:15:56 <tonyab>	Ah ok lol
Mar 03 13:17:25 <trev>	haha
Mar 03 13:18:07 <tonyab>	Well maybe I'll try out emacs builtin key bindings then
Mar 03 13:51:43 <glenneth>	wassup Folx. Starbucks break 😁
Mar 03 13:52:08 <trev>	glenneth: couldn't you send your personal assistant out for all those chores?
Mar 03 13:57:48 <glenneth>	apparently. I'm a terrible boss and he doesn't get paid enough to run these errands
Mar 03 13:59:41 <glenneth>	🤣
Mar 03 14:28:04 <nm0i>	Adventures of Trevin continue
Mar 03 14:28:06 <nm0i>	Morning all.
Mar 03 14:53:25 <Fade>	Good Morning
Mar 03 14:59:08 <benoitj>	hey fade
Mar 03 15:02:22 <mretka>	Hey nm0i Fade benoitj glenneth
Mar 03 15:02:51 *	mretka is diving deeper into the machine learning rabbit hole, now she started reading papers about ML algorithms
Mar 03 15:03:27 <Fade>	heya benoitj, mretka 
Mar 03 15:03:48 <mretka>	And I'm also learning how to weave multiple Jupyter notebooks together into a cohesive project, and send code and data between them
Mar 03 15:03:50 <Marvin2>	And I'm also learning how to type a password in authinfo or your libera code too, and it was a prot joke
Mar 03 15:04:11 <mretka>	rofl, dead
Mar 03 15:04:25 <Fade>	:)
Mar 03 15:04:53 <mretka>	Yeah, this is a thing Prot would def do
Mar 03 15:05:04 <mretka>	I mean, reading papers on ML algos
Mar 03 15:05:08 <Fade>	have you integrated jupyter with emacs?
Mar 03 15:05:33 <mretka>	Not yet, I'm feeling the urge to do that, but I wanna keep things as simple as possible for now
Mar 03 15:05:51 <Fade>	well, you're using jupyter, so that mission failed.
Mar 03 15:05:52 <Fade>	lol
Mar 03 15:06:04 <mretka>	My idea is to get the feel for how Jupyter is meant to be used, then try to put Emacs in the mix
Mar 03 15:06:07 <mretka>	lol, yeah
Mar 03 15:06:27 <mretka>	I'm exploring datasets in the Python shell inside Emacs though, so there's that
Mar 03 15:06:30 <Fade>	my understanding is that jupyter is a little like orgmode
Mar 03 15:06:35 <Fade>	with code blocks and prose
Mar 03 15:06:48 <mretka>	Although I need to get into jupyter to visualize the data with pandas and matplotlib and the like
Mar 03 15:06:59 <mretka>	Fade: yeah, it's pretty much the same thing, but with a GUI integration
Mar 03 15:07:17 <Fade>	emacs is a gui app!
Mar 03 15:07:20 <mretka>	There are cool ideas in there about organizing the literate programming stuff
Mar 03 15:07:30 <mretka>	Ah, yeah, you're correct
Mar 03 15:07:38 <mretka>	We can visualize data in org-babel with gnuplot
Mar 03 15:07:43 <Fade>	org itself is a gui integration. :D
Mar 03 15:08:24 <Fade>	sorry. just feeling a bit salty about python. I had to do some maintenance work on a very old python system from my distant past over the last month.
Mar 03 15:08:26 <Marvin2>	sorry. just feeling a bit longer
Mar 03 15:08:39 <Fade>	!status
Mar 03 15:08:41 <Marvin2>	status:: I know 36,323 phrases.
Mar 03 15:08:56 <mretka>	I understand the feeling completely Fade, I'm working between Ruby and Python now
Mar 03 15:09:04 <mretka>	And I also found this https://github.com/applied-science/emacs-vega-view
Mar 03 15:09:06 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/hMDsy ]::[ GitHub - applied-science/emacs-vega-view: A mode to facilitate interactive data visualization using Vega from within emacs ]
Mar 03 15:09:11 <Fade>	I'd take python over ruby, barely.
Mar 03 15:09:25 <Fade>	that looks interesting
Mar 03 15:09:31 <Fade>	what kind of data are you working with?
Mar 03 15:09:44 <mretka>	I used Vega Lite in Elixir a bit, but I'm sticking with the Python tools for now to get familiar with the ecosystem
Mar 03 15:09:57 <mretka>	Oh, just toy datasets for the moment
Mar 03 15:10:17 <mretka>	I'm practicing the end-to-end ML model workflow with the Titanic dataset from Kaggle
Mar 03 15:10:41 <mretka>	https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic
Mar 03 15:10:43 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/qbKBH ]::[ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster | Kaggle ]
Mar 03 15:12:36 <mretka>	This feels a lot like an end-to-end software deployment workflow
Mar 03 15:13:13 <Fade>	one thing that python has going for it, it has integration libraries for everything.
Mar 03 15:13:14 <mretka>	The extra steps when working with ML models are processing the training dataset, selecting which variables you want to pass to the model and "compiling" the model
Mar 03 15:13:38 <Fade>	it's so slow, I can't really picture using it for ML training.
Mar 03 15:15:01 <mretka>	Elixir is attempting to break into the ML training realm with the Livebook and Nx libraries by leveraging concurrent processing: https://livebook.dev/ https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx
Mar 03 15:15:04 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/CCUkK ]::[ Home - Livebook.dev ]
Mar 03 15:15:07 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/pMcSd ]::[ GitHub - elixir-nx/nx: Multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) and numerical definitions for Elixir ]
Mar 03 15:15:43 <Fade>	the erlang BEAM runtime is smarter than python, but I'd imagine you'd have to do something similar with python
Mar 03 15:16:43 <mretka>	What do you mean exactly?
Mar 03 15:17:18 <Fade>	I imagine erlang is sending job packets to little closures running in a compiled language
Mar 03 15:17:24 <Fade>	s/erlang/elixir
Mar 03 15:17:44 <Fade>	the actual training code for python is probably likewise running in a C lib.
Mar 03 15:18:30 <Fade>	this kind of work plan is easier in BEAM than it is in python, because the support for it is built in to the runtime.
Mar 03 15:31:25 <mretka>	Yeah, the training needs to run in the code inside the machine, it's easier to split the execution in the BEAM than directly in C libs
Mar 03 15:39:23 *	Fade nods
Mar 03 16:14:25 <sektor>	Howdy.
Mar 03 16:14:31 <nm0i>	Morning, sektor 
Mar 03 16:14:31 <sektor>	how are things?
Mar 03 16:21:02 <Fade>	ooh. there's a new sbcl
Mar 03 16:21:04 *	Fade builds it
Mar 03 16:21:14 <Fade>	heya, sektor, nm0i 
Mar 03 16:21:49 <naokotani>	woot
Mar 03 16:21:57 *	naokotani blows a party noise maker
Mar 03 16:24:45 <sektor>	Interesting; that reminds me I need to do package updates today.

Mar 04 05:03:57 <Fade>	exactly.

Mar 04 05:40:24 <benoitj>	possibly turning it off and on, and fsck the disk
Mar 04 05:41:02 <trev>	i'd like a job where i'm paid 3 days of work for saying that
Mar 04 05:43:26 <benoitj>	I mean, 6 hours is possibly a bit more than that. maybe replace a drive and restore a backup

Mar 04 06:13:25 <shom>	My eye doctor has a fancy laser machine that doesn't require dilation. Then she shows me the scans and I ask a lot of questions and she loves nerding out about it!
Mar 04 06:13:44 <benoitj>	shom: with the air stuff?
Mar 04 06:13:56 <benoitj>	I do get retinal scans too
Mar 04 06:14:07 <cow_2001>	woah
Mar 04 06:15:06 <shom>	Yeah, there's the puff of air machine and then there's the scanning machine, I has the line up target in your vision and then BAM! BRIGHT GREEN LASER
Mar 04 06:17:51 <shom>	I did zero computer crafting today but found an awesome deal an used wood crafting tool. Got a Grizzly jointer (makes one surface of wood perfectly flat) with a helical cutter head for $500 USD. The cutter alone costs $350 new! 
Mar 04 06:18:42 <cow_2001>	that's crafting
Mar 04 06:18:54 <cow_2001>	use earplugs
Mar 04 06:19:01 <glenneth>	shom: thicknesser/planer?
Mar 04 06:19:11 <cow_2001>	or ear... muffs thing
Mar 04 06:19:30 <benoitj>	shom: nice
Mar 04 06:19:58 <shom>	Ahh glenneth my UK friend I assume. A thicknesser is called a planer in the US and a UK planer is a jointer 
Mar 04 06:20:35 <benoitj>	why not a thickness planner?
Mar 04 06:20:51 <shom>	cow_2001: absolutely I wear the over the ears hearing protection, I need to be better about wearing a mask thkugh
Mar 04 06:21:04 <glenneth>	lol.  OK.  Good deal.  
Mar 04 06:21:07 <benoitj>	I mean, both are doing different things, one set thinkness right, the other makes the sides 90 degrees
Mar 04 06:21:12 <shom>	*though
Mar 04 06:21:34 <benoitj>	they are usually two different tools right?
Mar 04 06:21:37 <cow_2001>	shom: you deal with bad particles and fumes?
Mar 04 06:21:56 <glenneth>	yeah.  Faces and edges of boards
Mar 04 06:22:22 <shom>	benoitj: they are two different tools but you can get them in a combo machine 
Mar 04 06:22:48 <benoitj>	ok
Mar 04 06:22:59 <benoitj>	then it's a thinkness planner / jointer combo :D
Mar 04 06:23:27 <shom>	cow_2001: there's a lot of small particulate saw dust that's not good to breathe in the long run. So masks/respirators are a good idea
Mar 04 06:24:09 <shom>	benoitj: my thiNkness could use some planing 😂 
Mar 04 06:24:15 <benoitj>	:)
Mar 04 06:24:47 <benoitj>	I do have an old manual planer made of wood. it's like about 2 feet long
Mar 04 06:24:59 <glenneth>	shom: you need a cyclone in your dust extraction system :)
Mar 04 06:25:01 <benoitj>	hmm, maybe a bit more than a foot
Mar 04 06:25:54 <shom>	benoitj: those long handplanes are beasts! 
Mar 04 06:26:05 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 04 06:26:09 <benoitj>	with the wood handle too
Mar 04 06:26:14 <benoitj>	looks really cool
Mar 04 06:27:34 <shom>	glenneth: I have a Delta dust extractor that has a filter that dumps into a bag the "two story" kind. I do have a dust deputy cyclone for my shop vac that I use for sanding. What kind of stuff do you build? I've just been getting started really. 
Mar 04 06:27:37 <Marvin2>	glenneth: I have a lot of the channel but I thought about it
Mar 04 06:28:11 <shom>	Ha Marvin2 is right, I think more than I do. 
Mar 04 06:29:49 <glenneth>	shom: I don't.  My grandfather was a carpenter/cabinet maker.  I spent a lot of time in his workshop
Mar 04 06:32:01 <shom>	Oh that's really cool, I bet he had some good stories to tell. No one in my family was handy (just book and news readers) so I'm a little envious of your experience. I'm coming into the world of doing things with your hands later in life. Better late than never! 
Mar 04 06:33:12 <shom>	Goodnight everyone, thanks for wood crafting indulgence. 
Mar 04 06:34:00 <benoitj>	shom: nite
Mar 04 06:34:11 <benoitj>	shom: crafting is crafting
Mar 04 06:34:37 <glenneth>	nite shom 
Mar 04 06:35:10 <shom>	benoitj: glenneth ☺ hope you have a happy Monday! 
Mar 04 06:35:13 <Marvin2>	benoitj: glenneth ☺ hope you have a really good view of everst
Mar 04 06:35:59 <glenneth>	lol
Mar 04 07:11:20 <trev>	glenneth: what's the plan today, boss?
Mar 04 07:11:22 <Marvin2>	glenneth: what's the position responsible for?
Mar 04 07:20:44 <glenneth>	trev: finishing up a proposal for a job in Kuwait.  You?
Mar 04 07:37:52 <trev>	glenneth: oh, you know, just looking for a custom keycap
Mar 04 07:41:51 <glenneth>	haha.  Artisan?  A whole set or singular?
Mar 04 07:43:14 <trev>	i guess whole set since i can't find a 2u size that will fit on an ortholinear
Mar 04 07:44:31 <trev>	which keycap profile do you use glenneth ?
Mar 04 08:07:19 <fyrfaras>	Good meowning everybunny :3 !
Mar 04 08:08:14 <daviwil>	good morning all
Mar 04 08:08:17 <daviwil>	hey fyrfaras
Mar 04 08:08:33 <trev>	good morning
Mar 04 08:09:24 <glenneth>	trev: Mine are the topre keycaps for the hhkb.  Closer to OEM than Cherry I think
Mar 04 08:09:34 <glenneth>	hey fyrfaras o/
Mar 04 08:11:15 <glenneth>	trying to find an xda pofile for it though
Mar 04 08:11:35 <trev>	i am using xda now
Mar 04 08:13:26 <glenneth>	I have xda on my keychron Q10
Mar 04 08:14:50 <fyrfaras`>	Heya~ trev, glenneth and daviwil ^w^
Mar 04 08:15:25 <glenneth>	hey daviwil o/
Mar 04 08:15:42 <daviwil>	hey glenneth
Mar 04 08:18:08 <daviwil>	time to start doing taxes this week 🤮
Mar 04 08:19:09 <trev>	dun dun dunnn
Mar 04 08:19:51 <glenneth>	that's what accountants are for daviwil :)
Mar 04 08:20:45 <daviwil>	yeah, we have accountants for some parts, but there's still one part that I do myself because it costs more than I want to pay for the effort
Mar 04 08:21:40 <glenneth>	makes sense
Mar 04 08:22:23 <trev>	turbotax speedrun
Mar 04 08:22:27 <fyrfaras`>	Doing taxes myself is the last thing that keeps me from being a fully functional adult x3c
Mar 04 08:23:12 <daviwil>	taxes are annoying as hell
Mar 04 08:23:26 <daviwil>	that's like my biggest procrastination task of the year
Mar 04 08:23:37 <trev>	i'm a fully dysfunctional adult
Mar 04 08:24:28 <fyrfaras`>	Relatable ^^ My father is so super kind to handle taxes for me. I repay him with whiskey mostly xD
Mar 04 08:24:30 <trev>	my accountant went to prison for fraud
Mar 04 08:24:32 <glenneth>	Not a problem I have lol.  Digital nomad.  Don't pay taxes
Mar 04 08:25:28 <trev>	in the US if you make over $117K you're taxed globally
Mar 04 08:25:43 <daviwil>	glenneth: yep, just keep running from the taxman and they won't know where to send the penalty bills ;)
Mar 04 08:26:16 <glenneth>	really?  That sucks trev 
Mar 04 08:26:41 <trev>	yeah i think it's one of two countries that globally taxes its citizens 
Mar 04 08:26:46 <glenneth>	daviwil: I am truly non-domicile :D
Mar 04 08:27:03 <trev>	glenneth is heavily armed in a desert bunker
Mar 04 08:27:35 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 04 08:28:03 <daviwil>	I'm still waiting for glenneth's redacted personal blog
Mar 04 08:28:05 <Marvin2>	I'm still waiting for it...
Mar 04 08:28:08 <daviwil>	shut up marvin
Mar 04 08:28:11 <trev>	haha
Mar 04 08:28:31 <trev>	he doesn't miss a beat
Mar 04 08:28:36 <glenneth>	lol
Mar 04 08:28:43 <daviwil>	always interjecting at the most inappropriate time
Mar 04 08:28:49 <glenneth>	perfect timing
Mar 04 08:32:27 <trev>	taxes do yield some high anxiety. i always try to convince myself that they would never throw me in prison....right??
Mar 04 08:33:01 <daviwil>	you'd have to be making enough money for them to care
Mar 04 08:33:04 <Marvin2>	you'd have to spend my afternoon, but I think I'm good enough to run it CPU bound.
Mar 04 08:33:05 <daviwil>	not to say you don't
Mar 04 08:33:22 <daviwil>	I just think that they wouldn't bother prosecuting someone with a sub-million income
Mar 04 08:33:22 <trev>	that's what i hope
Mar 04 08:33:35 <daviwil>	they'll just fine you to hell
Mar 04 08:34:09 <trev>	from my understanding they just bother you for 7 years and then take serious action
Mar 04 08:34:22 <daviwil>	that's more reasonable
Mar 04 08:34:43 <glenneth>	In the UK it's the opposite.  They always seem to go for the smaller targets
Mar 04 08:34:51 <trev>	but like i said, my accountant was a fraud so i don't want them to come snoopin on me!
Mar 04 08:35:03 <glenneth>	Setting an example they call it 
Mar 04 08:35:11 <trev>	lol
Mar 04 08:35:46 <trev>	every time the taxman comes to someone's door, a knife crime occurs in the UK
Mar 04 08:35:49 <daviwil>	should have been obvious when he advertised himself as "Johnny Numbahs" in the phone book
Mar 04 08:36:04 <glenneth>	Seriously though.  I think I last paid a tax bill almost 20 yrs ago
Mar 04 08:36:16 <daviwil>	lucky man
Mar 04 08:37:06 <glenneth>	They have to find me first :)
Mar 04 08:37:12 <trev>	daviwil: when you open that street meat stand in greece, you'll have to pay the local mafia and taxes!
Mar 04 08:38:27 <daviwil>	looks like I should just create a new mafia instead
Mar 04 08:38:33 <daviwil>	more profit, less risk
Mar 04 08:39:49 <mickeynp>	glenneth: if you're british and a digital nomad i hope you have read HMRC's RDR1.
Mar 04 08:40:31 <mickeynp>	and ofc the RD3 as well as a supplemental
Mar 04 08:40:39 <daviwil>	hey mickeynp!
Mar 04 08:40:57 <mickeynp>	if you have 'significant ties' in the UK, working in the UK for a week or two could be enough to make you resident in the UK for tax purposes.
Mar 04 08:41:22 <mickeynp>	you're not domiciled, ever, in the uk, generally speaking, if your father is British and almost never if you were born British.
Mar 04 08:41:28 <mickeynp>	not "non-domiciled"*
Mar 04 08:41:37 <mickeynp>	hey David.
Mar 04 08:44:09 <glenneth>	my blog so far https://0x0.st/H7Ag.png :D
Mar 04 08:44:12 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/znaVp ]::[ Binary data ]
Mar 04 08:45:14 <glenneth>	mickeynp: As far as HMRC are concerned I am deceased :)
Mar 04 08:45:43 <mickeynp>	okay...
Mar 04 08:46:47 <glenneth>	I have zero ties to the UK.  No family, no property and I doubt I will ever go back except for visits
Mar 04 08:47:14 <mickeynp>	"the taxman can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."
Mar 04 08:47:58 <glenneth>	Nice quote.  But challenge accepted :D
Mar 04 08:48:10 <trev>	MI6 would never go after their top spy - glenneth 
Mar 04 08:48:44 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 04 08:55:05 <mickeynp>	writing a tree-sitter grammar is actually somewhat pleasant.
Mar 04 08:55:07 <Marvin2>	writing a lisp in Lua
Mar 04 08:55:18 <mickeynp>	even when I have to dip into C to write some custom scanner stuff.
Mar 04 08:56:30 <glenneth>	what grammaar are you writing?
Mar 04 08:57:39 <mickeynp>	a better jinja2 grammar
Mar 04 08:57:47 <mickeynp>	well, i'll try to split it out to handle Mako et al also
Mar 04 08:58:22 <alternateved>	Morning everyone
Mar 04 08:59:03 <glenneth>	hey alternateved o/
Mar 04 08:59:29 <glenneth>	mickeynp: cool :)
Mar 04 09:00:39 <trev>	mickeynp: are the grammars written in scheme?
Mar 04 09:01:19 <mickeynp>	Javascript and C
Mar 04 09:01:43 <mickeynp>	the query language is vaguely S-expression-y
Mar 04 09:01:57 <trev>	oh ok that is what i am thinking of
Mar 04 09:03:14 <mickeynp>	Javascript is a fine choice for the grammar though
Mar 04 09:03:28 <mickeynp>	instead of bikeshedding they just ran with that as it runs everywhere easily.
Mar 04 09:03:30 <Marvin2>	instead of insult
Mar 04 09:03:57 <mickeynp>	you still need a C compiler and more if you want rust bindings and whatnot.
Mar 04 09:20:46 <trev>	i was a treesitter hater until i realized that you can do some handy vim motions with it
Mar 04 09:20:49 <Marvin2>	i was at TSB.
Mar 04 09:25:26 <trev>	Marvin2: where is that?
Mar 04 09:25:44 <mickeynp>	a second-rate off-shoot of Lloyds bank
Mar 04 09:27:21 <trev>	marv must be getting ready to do his taxes too
Mar 04 09:27:26 <mickeynp>	why'd you hate TS?
Mar 04 09:27:33 <mickeynp>	installing it is a little bit painful in 29 I do admit
Mar 04 09:28:43 <trev>	i didn't think it was worthy of all the hype, only for some syntax highlighting. this was before i understood that i could do structural editing. i still don't really use it for more than 2-3 things though
Mar 04 09:28:46 <Marvin2>	i didn't mean it negatively...i should have paid more attention :)
Mar 04 09:29:17 <mickeynp>	yeah the highlighting is 'nice', but not a game changer.
Mar 04 09:29:34 <mickeynp>	the benefit is being able to write your own highlighter routines. I do that for things that bear special attention.
Mar 04 09:30:17 <mickeynp>	i built a piece of software for a client, and I used postgresql row-level security + roles, but I needed to assume 'admin' permissions (which I did with a context manager in Python) and I made Emacs highlight it using a TS query.
Mar 04 09:30:35 <mickeynp>	but the real power's in the CST for movement and editing, as you say.
Mar 04 09:45:29 <daviwil>	I still haven't started using TS in Emacs yet
Mar 04 09:45:30 <daviwil>	hey alternateved
Mar 04 10:04:39 <trev>	hi alternateved 
Mar 04 10:04:50 <alternateved>	hi
Mar 04 10:08:30 <mickeynp>	daviwil: how come?
Mar 04 10:10:57 <trev>	not needed for scheme and daviwil uses notepad++ for other languages
Mar 04 10:12:16 <daviwil>	mickeynp: just haven't made time for it yet, hacking on Emacs config actually comes last in the priority order surprisingly :)
Mar 04 11:00:45 <trev>	daviwil: tell the first priority
Mar 04 11:07:44 <daviwil>	working on projects
Mar 04 11:21:23 <trev>	i wish it was call of duty :[
Mar 04 12:01:49 <daviwil>	trev: I can only allocate an hour a day to that ;) 
Mar 04 13:50:02 <theesm>	Good morning crafters^^ 
Mar 04 13:59:30 <trev>	hey theesm 
Mar 04 14:01:55 <daviwil>	hey theesm
Mar 04 14:21:23 <theesm>	What's everybody up to today?
Mar 04 14:37:53 <naokotani>	working on my blog
Mar 04 14:38:27 <naokotani>	benoitj got mad at me because rss was broken and I didn't bother to properly set status codes
Mar 04 14:39:10 <naokotani>	status code issue is fixed, now i have to figure what the hell and rss is
Mar 04 14:39:11 <nm0i>	Can I get mad at you for not having an nntp mirror?..
Mar 04 14:39:34 <naokotani>	Can you? hell its your duty as a l337 crafter
Mar 04 14:41:57 <nm0i>	Why don't you serve rss over gopher?.. Pff, corporate shill, I bet you're against freedom in one way or another.
Mar 04 14:42:08 <nm0i>	Morning btw.
Mar 04 14:44:54 <naokotani>	true im a corporate shill. I am using digital ocean 
Mar 04 14:46:48 <naokotani>	Also, Have these gentleman ever seen a revoltution?
Mar 04 14:47:30 <nm0i>	Which gentleman?..
Mar 04 14:48:39 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 04 14:48:47 <naokotani>	its a phrase commonly used to troll anarchsts
Mar 04 14:48:52 <naokotani>	anarchists*
Mar 04 14:50:55 <nm0i>	Nah I'm just being sarcastic. If you want to troll me, use cookies.
Mar 04 14:51:14 <benoitj>	naokotani: ...
Mar 04 14:52:02 <naokotani>	? 
Mar 04 14:54:52 <trev>	not knowing what rss is should get you put in timeout
Mar 04 14:57:57 <naokotani>	I will submit to a timeout if that is the ruling
Mar 04 14:58:28 <daviwil>	"Wanna feel old?  Remember RSS?"
Mar 04 14:59:27 <trev>	the cool kids use atom now i guess (not the dead editor)
Mar 04 15:02:32 <naokotani>	Appanretly my site uses atom
Mar 04 15:02:35 <naokotani>	and I didn't tell it to
Mar 04 15:02:45 <naokotani>	I mean I guess I did inadvertently
Mar 04 15:05:46 <naokotani>	benoitj: how did you find this broken rss stuff?
Mar 04 15:06:27 <benoitj>	I just loaded your site in my reader
Mar 04 15:06:29 <Marvin2>	I just gave up after a night of cat watching
Mar 04 15:07:03 <naokotani>	what's your reader?
Mar 04 15:07:22 <daviwil>	Marvin2: don't give up, that can't isn't going to watch itself
Mar 04 15:07:25 <daviwil>	cat*
Mar 04 15:11:15 <benoitj>	naokotani: miniflux
Mar 04 15:11:38 <benoitj>	I also use elfeed, but miniflux does rss discovery
Mar 04 15:12:42 <benoitj>	it's not the first broken rss i've seen, so I just sent this over to a rss validator, but in your case it told me that weird "404!" body issue was not valid
Mar 04 15:12:51 <benoitj>	so I curled it to confirm
Mar 04 15:14:08 <naokotani>	yeah the 404! was very not valid. it had no head, no content type no status code. it was literally just plain text "404!"
Mar 04 15:16:25 <naokotani>	"Installing Miniflux is straightforward if you have some basic system administration knowledge." ngl I was really hoping for something along the lines of "apt install miniflux"
Mar 04 15:16:27 <Marvin2>	"Installing Miniflux is straightforward if you have lots of wind
Mar 04 15:16:48 <naokotani>	Actually, Marvin, I am not particually gassy today.
Mar 04 15:20:17 <naokotani>	Database configuration? can we not just use SQLite like a civilizaed app?
Mar 04 15:25:23 <naokotani>	so basically.... I would just make a route likes my-site.com/rss that would responde with this xml file that has each blog post as an item?
Mar 04 15:27:49 <benoitj>	naokotani: just use newsboat then, and point it to your atom feed
Mar 04 15:28:00 <benoitj>	or just put your atom feed into a RSS validator
Mar 04 15:29:04 <benoitj>	elfeed works equaly well
Mar 04 15:29:23 <benoitj>	I use miniflux because I like to access my feeds on multiple computers and I dont want to re-read stuff
Mar 04 15:31:09 <naokotani>	oohhhh
Mar 04 15:31:14 <naokotani>	I think i have it
Mar 04 15:31:42 <naokotani>	so the rss discovery thing is going to common rss feed urls and because its getting a code 200 it assumes it should exist
Mar 04 15:31:56 <benoitj>	you can test it by loading my feed: https://blog.benoitj.ca/posts/index.xml
Mar 04 15:31:57 <naokotani>	but then when it tries to load it, its invalid
Mar 04 15:31:59 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/WiKdB ]::[ Posts on My mostly tech blog ]
Mar 04 15:32:18 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 04 15:32:21 <benoitj>	it's not there
Mar 04 15:32:42 <benoitj>	your website tells my ready to find the rss feed in 4 different places, but these files are not there
Mar 04 15:32:50 <benoitj>	ready = reader
Mar 04 15:32:54 <naokotani>	so its going ot like chris-hughes.dev/feed, getting a 200 and then trying to load the xml file, getting osm eplain text which is 404! and complaining
Mar 04 15:33:02 <benoitj>	yep
Mar 04 15:33:47 <benoitj>	it's not typical to public 4 places like this. one is enough, but the xml has to be there :)
Mar 04 15:34:59 <naokotani>	my website was jsut returing 200 for any url that started with my domain name
Mar 04 15:36:06 <naokotani>	ok I think I have identified the problem. making the feed seems simple enough, I just need to figure out how to sort of the publish date
Mar 04 15:36:07 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 04 15:36:09 <Marvin2>	ok I think its kind of dangerous there
Mar 04 15:36:22 <benoitj>	nice
Mar 04 15:36:38 <benoitj>	mine is taken from hugo's "post date"
Mar 04 15:37:57 <naokotani>	I don't have the date anywhere. only thing that's close is the modified time in the filesystem, but every time I edit a post its going to change even if I just add a period, I don't htink people wnt ot be notified that I cahnged a period lol
Mar 04 15:38:00 <Marvin2>	I don't use sublime text anymore but it's a hack :)
Mar 04 15:38:46 <benoitj>	yeah, modified is not right as the date must be "immutable" and never change, otherwise the readers will detect new posts all the time
Mar 04 15:38:57 <benoitj>	predictable is the right word
Mar 04 15:39:30 <benoitj>	maybe that is something to fix first, have a post date? ;)
Mar 04 15:40:00 <naokotani>	True. I mean I can just put the title and POSTED: x y z athte top fo each
Mar 04 15:40:15 <benoitj>	if this was a "head" tag, maybe meta, then you would be able to pull it even from node
Mar 04 15:40:17 <naokotani>	I don't actually have an h1 on my posts
Mar 04 15:40:34 <naokotani>	yeah I just use um....
Mar 04 15:41:05 <naokotani>	cheerio
Mar 04 15:41:08 <naokotani>	its a web scraper
Mar 04 15:41:16 <naokotani>	thats how I make the thumbnails
Mar 04 15:41:19 <benoitj>	ok

Mar 04 18:58:47 <ashraz>	Hello, Crafters
Mar 04 19:09:27 <ashraz>	Huh. Slow day?
Mar 04 19:17:09 <benoitj>	yeah :)
Mar 04 19:17:24 <benoitj>	a bit of action this morning, but now it's been calm
Mar 04 19:19:33 <trev>	after the day defeats me i have nothing to say
Mar 04 19:24:22 <benoitj>	days of defeat?
Mar 04 19:35:17 <Fade>	sometimes victory seems a mere echo 
Mar 04 19:35:28 <Fade>	other days, it is a flawless symphony
Mar 04 19:35:34 <Fade>	but mostly, I'm deaf.
Mar 04 19:42:40 <trev>	hehe
Mar 04 20:09:04 <naokotani>	well, im the proud owner of a shiny new 404 page
Mar 04 20:14:18 <naokotani>	i wonder
Mar 04 20:14:36 <naokotani>	error underlines
Mar 04 20:14:42 <naokotani>	how do you change them
Mar 04 20:17:13 <sahil_>	I want to bind leader x in emacs to execute-current-file-function, which runs something like !g++ -o.... && ./exe, and shows the output in the minibuffer area. Then just pressing q closes the popped up minibuffer, and I can continue programming.
Mar 04 20:18:21 <sahil_>	I tried https://termbin.com/t4iq9 with the help of chatGPT, but this creates a new buffer each time, and I have to take the cursor to that buffer to close it

Mar 04 20:30:18 <naokotani>	what about complilation mode

Mar 05 07:40:00 <daviwil>	I'd also like to make a video on minimal CSS because it's quite possible to make your own style sheet without a lot of headache 
Mar 05 07:41:26 <apoorv569>	Could it be the re-directs?
Mar 05 07:42:15 <BigEatie>	apoorv569: I don't really like the idea of having massive headers -- would prefer the script take care of that kind of stuff. Pretty hackish what I'm doing right now: https://0x0.st/H71l.txt

Mar 05 07:43:04 <BigEatie>	sidebar.html contains the custom class info
Mar 05 07:43:24 <apoorv569>	Yes, that is the reason I am using david's publish.el I don't want to do stuff like that manually every time.
Mar 05 07:47:07 <BigEatie>	daviwil: Looking forward to it
Mar 05 08:02:25 <glenneth>	Hi o/.  Had to reboot.  Nvidia updates :)
Mar 05 08:05:43 <vii_majesty>	ah
Mar 05 08:17:10 <shom>	daviwil: i would love to see your take on minimal css which is still nice to look at. I'd imagine it would be like the system crafters site (which is both minimal and nice to look at). I've been playing with css grid and flex and it's quite nice with media queries. 
Mar 05 08:21:13 <shom>	apoorv569: terminal css is interesting, thanks. I also like water.css and pico.css since they're semantic css/HTML so it's nice to get the "paint" without committing to any specific "framework" 
Mar 05 08:25:09 <daviwil>	shom: Yeah, that's basically all you need
Mar 05 08:32:08 <glenneth>	hey shom o/.  I was just taking a look at y;ur site :)
Mar 05 08:32:17 <glenneth>	your*
Mar 05 08:36:37 <shom>	Hi glenneth! It's built with org to ox-hugo to hugo. But the film section is basically just grid and flexbox type deal. 
Mar 05 08:37:44 <glenneth>	Great photo's
Mar 05 08:38:42 <glenneth>	Saw it on the ox-hugo examples page.  Is that *THE* shom ?  lol
Mar 05 08:54:49 <trev>	might as well just make a gopher site
Mar 05 08:54:52 <Marvin2>	might as well just make a game. Open source projects and get better :)
Mar 05 08:55:09 <trev>	yeah, what marvin said
Mar 05 09:00:37 <alternateved>	Morning everyone
Mar 05 09:04:30 <shom>	glenneth: hahaha thanks... It's A me! Shom(io)!!
Mar 05 09:05:29 <glenneth>	I'm having ah issue with my hugo config.  I have set the base_url but when running hugo to export, all the links point back to localhost:1313 in the index.html file?  Any clue anyone? :)
Mar 05 09:06:06 <shom>	trev: I was generating a gemini site as well but never got the ci/cd setup. So unsurprisingly it never kept up. I should get it going. 
Mar 05 09:06:44 <shom>	glenneth: is the base url also set in the toml/yaml file? 
Mar 05 09:07:04 <shom>	o/ alternateved 
Mar 05 09:07:10 <shom>	Good morning 
Mar 05 09:35:24 <glenneth>	hey alternateved o/
Mar 05 09:36:05 <glenneth>	shom: I set it in the hugo.toml file
Mar 05 09:38:18 <shom>	Hmmmm do you have `#+hugo_base_dir: .` At the top of your org file? 
Mar 05 09:38:37 <shom>	Oh sorry I assumed you were using ox-hugo! Are you? 
Mar 05 09:38:46 <shom>	glenneth: 👆🏽 
Mar 05 09:41:36 <glenneth>	no.  Using easy-hugo, but I'm running hugo from the CLI
Mar 05 09:43:02 <glenneth>	using easy-hugoo just to manage the posts.  I'm not exporting anything from emacs just yet
Mar 05 10:00:55 <shom>	glenneth: are you running `hugo` or `hugo serve`? 
Mar 05 10:02:31 <shom>	As long as the other settings in the toml file are being honored (indicating there's not a shadowed file elsewhere) then base_url should be the only thing you need to set. Maybe even try with/out quotes around the base_url valje
Mar 05 10:02:38 <shom>	*value
Mar 05 10:12:32 <glenneth>	I run hugo then hugo server
Mar 05 10:13:32 <glenneth>	baseurl = "https://mysite.url.here"
Mar 05 10:13:34 <Marvin2>	[ https://mysite.url.here" ]::[ Couldn't fetch this page. ]
Mar 05 10:13:47 <shom>	Ah okay. When you run hugo server it will point it to local host. If you just run hugo command and check the public folder it should point to base url
Mar 05 10:14:15 <glenneth>	one sec
Mar 05 10:20:38 <apoorv569>	shom: Water css looks nice, pico doesn't look minimal enough for a text based blog site. It does look good though.
Mar 05 10:20:41 <Marvin2>	shom: Water css looks nice, pico doesn't look minimal enough for me :D
Mar 05 10:21:02 <apoorv569>	Thank you Marvin2
Mar 05 10:23:34 <shom>	apoorv569: for sure, pico is better for a web app not a text blog. Water is pretty small and a nice look out of the box. Hope I'll catch your site unveiling! 
Mar 05 10:23:36 <Marvin2>	apoorv569: for sure, that's what's really appealing about Rust. It's less rewiring my brain is running in CL.
Mar 05 10:24:49 <apoorv569>	shom: Yes, my site doesn't have much content yet, will go live once I have at least 2-3 blogs to go with.
Mar 05 10:24:52 <Marvin2>	shom: Yes, my site doesn't have much content yet, will go live once I get all of it once I get it going.
Mar 05 10:25:22 <apoorv569>	I'm very noob at writing BTW also english is not my first language, so I might not use the best words.
Mar 05 10:27:57 <shom>	apoorv569: it's all for fun, I hope you share when you're comfortable. I struggle with getting started so I've decided to just start... Hahaha actually I wrote a blog post about it https://shom.dev/posts/20240202_how-to-get-started/

Mar 05 10:29:35 <apoorv569>	Yes, same, I struggled with it as well, but finally just decided to do something rather than nothing :P
Mar 05 10:30:16 <apoorv569>	Thanks for sharing your blog, just a quick glance, I see a lot of stuff I have trouble with.
Mar 05 10:30:40 <shom>	Awesome! Also, your English is great. I'm sure your posts will be great too! 
Mar 05 10:30:56 <apoorv569>	Thank you! Appreciate it.
Mar 05 10:32:15 <glenneth>	I got something weird happening.  the site is https://my.site.url/glenneth/  but if i put that in the baseuri in my config, hugo then maes all of the links https://my.site.url/glenneth/glenneth/  and if i rmove the /glenneth/  hugo removes it too

Mar 05 10:32:35 *	glenneth is very confused
Mar 05 10:33:34 <glenneth>	shom you were  right though.  My mistake running hugo then hugo server
Mar 05 10:44:31 <trev>	marvin gets really annoying when expanding links and talking at the same time
Mar 05 10:44:43 <shom>	glenneth: you might need to turn on RelativeURLs=true
Mar 05 10:44:43 <shom>	CanonifyURLs=true
Mar 05 10:46:17 <shom>	Well RelativeURLs might not be strictly necessary 
Mar 05 10:48:00 <glenneth>	shom  I have just read that before coming back here to let you know I may have identified the issue :)
Mar 05 10:48:37 <glenneth>	I appreciate your time and your help shom 
Mar 05 10:50:15 <shom>	glenneth: yay! Glad it's figured out. Looking forward to checking out your and apoorv569 's blogs! 
Mar 05 10:52:33 <glenneth>	it was relativeURLS canonifyurls was aready true  changed relativeURLS = false to relativeURLS = true and the links are all correct.
Mar 05 10:54:56 <shom>	Ah, good to know. The documentation is a bit confusing on that! So you set canonifyURLs to false then? 
Mar 05 11:32:10 <glenneth>	not yet.  That's my next step because the theme isn.t being picked up correctly
Mar 05 12:14:31 <glenneth>	OMG!!! It is actually working :) :D
Mar 05 12:14:48 <daviwil>	nice :)
Mar 05 12:15:01 <glenneth>	correct theme ahd everything
Mar 05 12:15:57 <glenneth>	Thanks daviwil 
Mar 05 12:16:55 <glenneth>	And a massive thank you shom .  Thank you for your patience.
Mar 05 12:17:52 <glenneth>	Now I have to think of something worth posting lol
Mar 05 12:49:30 <naokotani>	You have a blog?
Mar 05 12:52:36 <glenneth>	It looks like I do now naokotani  :) or at least very soon(ish)
Mar 05 12:54:49 <naokotani>	Sick dope. how did you make it?
Mar 05 12:56:57 <glenneth>	hugo and github pages.  Though I'm sure I've got the github end configured incorrectly :D
Mar 05 12:58:16 <naokotani>	Nice. Benoit usese huge too. I decided to go with some janky mess I hacked together myself

Mar 05 12:59:46 <glenneth>	nice.  I caught the backend of your conversation with benoitj earlier
Mar 05 13:00:39 <naokotani>	IT was a whole entire journey. I had to figure out how to create a publishing date and then pull that out of the html and format it correctly among other things
Mar 05 13:00:43 <Marvin2>	IT was for hand written links and just moving thousands of lines of code to generate a response.
Mar 05 13:00:49 <naokotani>	but I think its working pretty good now
Mar 05 13:01:03 <glenneth>	added to my elfeed :)
Mar 05 13:01:31 <glenneth>	8 posts to read
Mar 05 13:02:24 <naokotani>	I don't know if tehy are exactly page turners, but that sound about right
Mar 05 13:02:38 <naokotani>	actaully as an engineer you might find the diesel database one somewhat interest
Mar 05 13:03:00 <naokotani>	My brother is a chemical engineer and I showed him plantuml and he was right into it
Mar 05 13:03:22 <naokotani>	He needed something to create plant startup procedures or something
Mar 05 13:04:02 <glenneth>	Ahh.  OK.  I'll definitely check them out
Mar 05 13:04:39 <glenneth>	plant startup.  Always bad on the nerves lol
Mar 05 13:05:22 <naokotani>	probably lol. His stuff is for experiments
Mar 05 13:05:45 <naokotani>	He does energy research
Mar 05 13:06:53 <glenneth>	cool.  I mainly work on energy production and distribution
Mar 05 13:07:35 <glenneth>	Power plant, overhead power lines and sub-stations
Mar 05 13:07:37 <naokotani>	oh, so similar stuff, but you are more on the electrical engineering side
Mar 05 13:07:46 <glenneth>	Yeah
Mar 05 13:08:07 <glenneth>	brb - Coffee
Mar 05 13:08:08 <naokotani>	yeah the overlap would be power plants. 
Mar 05 13:08:56 <naokotani>	My dad did a lot of the power line and sub station stuff. He did research and project management for the power utility in our province. 
Mar 05 13:09:25 <naokotani>	When I was a kid he worked a lot of micro hydro and wind projects in the remote northern areas
Mar 05 13:22:46 <glenneth>	I've worked on hydro, nuclear, gas, coai and diesel fired power plants.  But nearly all were 50 > MW plant

Mar 05 13:24:24 <naokotani>	I helped fix the wheel on a truck lol
Mar 05 13:25:31 <naokotani>	The issue is that those communities there is no way to get power from the outside. They either need to truck in diesel for generators or use renewables

Mar 05 13:32:21 <naokotani>	that's the place. 227km from the nearest paved road. You can only drive there in teh winter because you need to drive over lakes to get there
Mar 05 13:37:09 <glenneth>	Sounds and looks awesome lol.  Dangerous
Mar 05 13:38:41 <glenneth>	I tried for a position in Iceland working geothermal, but I didn't get it 
Mar 05 13:40:26 <naokotani>	um. it can be a bit dangerous because its really isolated. if you car breaks down on that road you better have a sleeping bag
Mar 05 13:40:28 <Marvin2>	um. it can be useful
Mar 05 13:41:22 <naokotani>	but in the winter the road is pretty safe for cars. the ice gets to like 1-2 meters thick and they drive transport trucks with huge mining equipment on them
Mar 05 13:41:25 <Marvin2>	but in your container diagram, and then at some point.
Mar 05 13:41:57 <naokotani>	pretty common for it to be -40 to -45 in the winter there
Mar 05 13:42:23 <glenneth>	celsius?
Mar 05 13:42:31 <naokotani>	yeah, celsius
Mar 05 13:43:58 <glenneth>	I've become too soft, working in the middle east.  The thought of going back to the UK in winter fills me with dread :D
Mar 05 13:45:33 <naokotani>	The people here would die instantly in the middle east
Mar 05 13:45:44 <naokotani>	if it gets to like 28 celsius here people freak out
Mar 05 13:46:42 <naokotani>	but I know what you mean. I spent about 3 years where I was out of canada for the winter and my first winter back was very uncomfortable
Mar 05 13:46:46 <Marvin2>	but I did with a bachelor's in something random who got into it a hand holding sort of an ops background
Mar 05 13:52:15 <glenneth>	Yeah, I've worked in 50+ deg C in Kuwait.  Regularly too.  It's horrible
Mar 05 13:53:11 <naokotani>	I've never really been anywhere particularly hot. I was in India, but it was winter
Mar 05 13:53:27 <naokotani>	oh yeah lol. I was In Kerala during spring and that was really damn hot
Mar 05 13:53:27 <glenneth>	it starts getting down to 20C and I start to complain it's getting cold :D
Mar 05 13:53:30 <Marvin2>	oh yeah that is true
Mar 05 13:53:32 <Marvin2>	it starts getting down to delete words that would be interesting. Some of our nepal trip pictures
Mar 05 13:53:44 <naokotani>	it was I think about 36c
Mar 05 13:53:53 <glenneth>	I see Marvin2 is on form
Mar 05 13:53:59 <naokotani>	but like 98% humidity
Mar 05 13:54:36 <naokotani>	I was with this person from Holland and we played a light game of frisbee in the shade for like 10 minutes and she started throwing up
Mar 05 13:55:31 <glenneth_>	yeah. that's what made Kuwait so bad. right on the gulf coast
Mar 05 13:58:40 <naokotani>	I finally broke down and went back to tmux
Mar 05 14:00:54 <trev>	naokotani: that was fast
Mar 05 14:00:55 <Marvin2>	naokotani: that is
Mar 05 14:01:32 <naokotani>	Really? I used zellij for... well several months at least
Mar 05 14:01:57 <trev>	oh i thought you were only just trying it out for a few days lol
Mar 05 14:02:01 <naokotani>	It started just randomly deciding it prefered horizontal splits and I was like ight, im out
Mar 05 14:02:18 <trev>	you can't control it?
Mar 05 14:02:42 <naokotani>	I assume you must be able to, but I was having a hard time figuring it out
Mar 05 14:03:01 <naokotani>	there is a new pane and it seems to hav ea bit of a mind of its own
Mar 05 14:04:36 <naokotani>	I think if the developer sticks with it its going to be great, but it still feels a tiny bit under cooked
Mar 05 14:10:06 <trev>	tmux doesn't have the appeal that modern projects have i guess
Mar 05 14:10:53 <trev>	lacking a nice config language, uses a man page instead of github readme/wiki
Mar 05 14:11:32 <naokotani>	yeah. if I configured tmux anywhere near to the same extent as vim let alone emacs that woul dbe more of an issue
Mar 05 14:11:33 <trev>	it's powerful but no one cares to read the docs
Mar 05 14:12:11 <naokotani>	although, yeah I am sure if I read the docs it does all kinds of nifty stuff
Mar 05 14:13:00 <trev>	but also it does what it needs to right away, as long as you can figure out how to hit the prefix and create some panes and windows then it's enough for most people
Mar 05 14:13:57 <naokotani>	I am sure if I were more inot the system admin side of things I would be more interested in learning its features
Mar 05 14:18:34 <trev>	i use it locally too, since it works nicely with nvim. I know that people not prefer using terminals that have built in multiplexing like kitty or wezterm
Mar 05 14:18:50 <trev>	tabs and splits and whatever else they stuff in them
Mar 05 14:20:10 <naokotani>	I am windows terminal man myself
Mar 05 14:20:14 <naokotani>	I think it does that stuff
Mar 05 14:20:19 <naokotani>	well I know it does tabs
Mar 05 14:20:37 <naokotani>	its actually a very good terminal
Mar 05 14:21:28 <naokotani>	its got a really nice gui configuration, its got a good json configuration. really the only bad thing about I can think of it is its microsoft
Mar 05 14:22:56 <trev>	my dad owns michaelsoft
Mar 05 14:23:06 <trev>	don't make fun of it
Mar 05 15:43:28 <glenneth>	just got a message that my glove80 has arrived :)
Mar 05 15:43:55 <glenneth>	what a day
Mar 05 16:11:48 <Fade>	Good Morning
Mar 05 16:12:03 <daviwil>	hey Fade
Mar 05 16:13:03 <Fade>	heya, daviwil 
Mar 05 16:14:25 <alternateved>	hey Fade 
Mar 05 16:14:35 <talos>	Good day all~
Mar 05 16:14:36 <trev>	hi Marvin2's dad
Mar 05 16:15:06 <Fade>	trevoni the trevster
Mar 05 16:15:18 <Fade>	alternateved, talos 
Mar 05 16:16:18 <talos>	Yo~
Mar 05 16:20:40 <naokotani>	Hello *
Mar 05 16:21:03 <naokotani>	It's 11:20 and I haven't done a damn thing all day
Mar 05 16:21:21 <naokotani>	what an unmitigated disaster
Mar 05 16:21:32 <glenneth>	Fade: o/
Mar 05 16:21:49 <glenneth>	hey talos 
Mar 05 16:23:11 <Fade>	heya, glenneth 
Mar 05 16:24:00 <glenneth>	how's things?
Mar 05 16:24:34 <talos>	Hiyo glenneth
Mar 05 16:24:54 <talos>	Just woke up about 30 min ago here lol
Mar 05 16:24:59 <Marvin2>	Just woke up today, I looked at yesterday, you are asking questions above my pay grade there
Mar 05 16:25:07 <talos>	lmao
Mar 05 16:25:12 <glenneth>	lol
Mar 05 16:25:25 <Fade>	not too bad. I was on dad-ops duty today, making the child clean and making his lunch, so I feel like I've had a full day, and my init routine isn't even finished. :]
Mar 05 16:25:41 <glenneth>	haha
Mar 05 16:26:43 <glenneth>	that's an unknown world to me 
Mar 05 16:27:04 <Fade>	sometimes I miss my bachelor days, but never seriously.
Mar 05 16:27:55 <Fade>	TIL that children can't bring peanut butter sandwiches to school.
Mar 05 16:28:19 <Fade>	since I ate this type of sandwich at school every day of my public school career, I was very surprised.
Mar 05 16:28:22 <glenneth>	i have nothing to compare it against :)
Mar 05 16:28:44 <glenneth>	allergys?
Mar 05 16:28:56 <Fade>	apparently peanut allergies are a real problem now.
Mar 05 16:29:16 <Fade>	like even walking by a school with a snickers bar in your pocket could get you arrested on attempted murder charges.
Mar 05 16:29:19 <Marvin2>	like even walking by a billionaire.
Mar 05 16:29:28 <glenneth>	lol
Mar 05 16:29:32 <daviwil>	well, maybe
Mar 05 16:29:50 <Fade>	my wife was ++anoyed. she foned me just as I was finishing three sandwiches and she was all "THROW IT OUT!"
Mar 05 16:29:54 <Marvin2>	my wife was ++anoyed. she foned me just as I could
Mar 05 16:30:11 <Fade>	<Fade> WTF are you talking about woman?! don't know know how much work just happened right here?
Mar 05 16:30:14 <Marvin2>	<Fade> WTF are you guys ready for the summer lore
Mar 05 16:30:29 <naokotani>	what what out? the sandwhiches?
Mar 05 16:30:33 <naokotani>	throw what*
Mar 05 16:30:40 <Fade>	the sandwiches
Mar 05 16:30:42 <glenneth>	even marcus has a wife
Mar 05 16:30:52 <naokotani>	Not a big sandwhich eater I guess
Mar 05 16:30:59 <glenneth>	Marvin2: even
Mar 05 16:31:01 <Fade>	in the general case I can recommend the wife experience.
Mar 05 16:31:05 <Fade>	five stars.
Mar 05 16:31:22 <Fade>	sometimes, there aren't any stars to be found, but it's still worth it. :D
Mar 05 16:31:54 <glenneth>	crossed that bridge already i think
Mar 05 16:31:56 <Fade>	naokotani: I think it was strictly down to the fact that they were peanut butter and jam sandwiches.
Mar 05 16:32:00 <naokotani>	oh, yeah I ahve a wife
Mar 05 16:32:32 <glenneth>	dammit naokotani you too? 
Mar 05 16:32:37 <daviwil>	borat voice: "my wife"
Mar 05 16:32:44 <glenneth>	jk 
Mar 05 16:32:44 <Fade>	what an unusual tribe of geeks assembled here.
Mar 05 16:33:08 <Fade>	all wifed up. only glenneth is sane, and he's living in the fucking middle east.
Mar 05 16:33:11 <Fade>	lol
Mar 05 16:33:32 <glenneth>	true :)
Mar 05 16:33:34 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 05 16:33:49 <naokotani>	most people have wives right?
Mar 05 16:33:54 <naokotani>	I think its somewhat common
Mar 05 16:33:58 <visl>	i dunno if peanut allergies are more of a real problem than they used to be. times have changed. when i was a wee lad it was the allergic kid's responsibility to not eat peanuts. these days it's everyone's problem
Mar 05 16:34:07 <Fade>	it's not that common in geeky circles.
Mar 05 16:34:11 <Fade>	or not *as* common.
Mar 05 16:34:19 <trev>	i love PB&Js
Mar 05 16:34:41 <Fade>	trev: pretty much all the north american children of my generation were made out of PB&J.
Mar 05 16:34:45 <naokotani>	peanut allergy has probably always been a thing and they just couldn't figure out why a lot of kids weren't getting past kingergarten
Mar 05 16:34:46 <benoitj>	visl: what do you mean? I still think it's the kids responsibilities
Mar 05 16:34:49 <Marvin2>	visl: what do you like the pens
Mar 05 16:35:03 <trev>	i had a slight p-nut allergy but i somehow got over it
Mar 05 16:35:15 <trev>	it still closes my throat a little if i eat too much
Mar 05 16:35:23 <naokotani>	You know what the joker says, what doesn't kill you makes you stranger
Mar 05 16:35:29 <daviwil>	trev: You're allergic to the bass player of 311?
Mar 05 16:35:31 <benoitj>	but it's everyone's responsibility to make sure to clearly state if there are peanuts in their stuff
Mar 05 16:35:36 <Fade>	at this point, I'm very very strange.
Mar 05 16:35:50 <visl>	benoitj: fade used to be able to take pb sandwiches, but now fade jr. cannot. now it's fade/fade jr.'s responsibility (in addition to the allergic one) instead of just the allergic one 
Mar 05 16:36:05 <glenneth>	you and me both Fade 
Mar 05 16:36:26 <naokotani>	When I was in university this guy was eating a peanut butter raisin and magic mushroom sandwhich and this strict muslim guy asked what it was and he just disclosed the peanut butter and raisins so he snatched it took a huge bite
Mar 05 16:36:40 <benoitj>	visl: I dont think it's like that, it's a learning process and parents are part of the learning process. what do you expect, the young kids to just "experiment" and find out what works?
Mar 05 16:36:53 <Fade>	I was told by my friend, a pediatrician, that some children can have deadly reactions to even the odor of peanut butter.
Mar 05 16:36:55 <naokotani>	then he got super high, angry and vacuumed his room the entire night 
Mar 05 16:37:06 <Fade>	(I just called her on account of my newly acquired info)
Mar 05 16:37:28 <trev>	even when i was in school they had a "no peanut butter" table
Mar 05 16:37:40 <naokotani>	I Think if its legit going to kill children we can probably just eat something else realistically
Mar 05 16:37:54 <Fade>	I haven't been my son's age since 1979.
Mar 05 16:37:55 <benoitj>	visl: it's the parent's responsibility to teach them to be responsible with that, but that takes time and a bit of maturity
Mar 05 16:38:03 <Fade>	times were different back then. 
Mar 05 16:38:12 <Fade>	I died once, and my mother made me walk it off.
Mar 05 16:38:12 <visl>	benoitj: hah. i'm not putting expectations on anything. i don't think it's good or bad. it just is.  in addition to peanuts, my kid can't take snacks with gluten or dairy snacks because of the vegan kid
Mar 05 16:38:15 <naokotani>	I havne't been my son's age since 1990
Mar 05 16:38:16 <benoitj>	+ when we do groceries, not my kid who do it
Mar 05 16:39:03 <visl>	benoitj: i'm not complaining about it. it's just now a community thing now
Mar 05 16:39:27 <Fade>	I don't think vegans get to dictate what's in my kid's lunch.
Mar 05 16:39:31 <benoitj>	visl: oh, that is a different problem with schooling systems. crazy parents sueing schools for anything and everything, including allergy. and the school's transition to "no risk" thing
Mar 05 16:39:47 <Fade>	I scrapped the sandwiches and sent him with left-over pizza.
Mar 05 16:40:00 <visl>	an upgrade!
Mar 05 16:40:06 <Fade>	it was an upgrade
Mar 05 16:40:11 <Fade>	now I don't get any lunch. :)
Mar 05 16:40:12 <Fade>	lol
Mar 05 16:41:20 <benoitj>	there is an age thing though, the tricky time is when they are <7 ish, especially if they just recently got diagnosis
Mar 05 16:42:14 <Fade>	i've never heard of lunch restrictions before today, but they don't seem unreasonable given the gravity of anaphylactic shock. forcing my family to conform to the dietary whims of vegans is not on. I've never heard of that before.
Mar 05 16:42:36 <benoitj>	yeah, that is weird
Mar 05 16:42:44 <visl>	yeah.. i mean in the end it's not _too_ hard and we ignore it in the end. 
Mar 05 16:42:58 <visl>	we've taught our <7 to just not share, and i think the teachers help enforce it during lunch
Mar 05 16:43:13 <Fade>	poor vegan kid.
Mar 05 16:43:29 <Fade>	enjoy your soy curd, son!
Mar 05 16:43:30 <visl>	i even once suggested he share with his friend and he quickly corrected me
Mar 05 16:43:45 <visl>	yeah.. we worry a bit about the vegan kid. hope they're not malnourished 
Mar 05 16:45:58 <naokotani>	My son was vegetarian until he was about 3
Mar 05 16:46:17 <naokotani>	but he wasn't gaining neough weight so we put hiom on a strict diet of pork sausages
Mar 05 16:46:30 <Fade>	I was a vegetarian for a couple of years, but it almost killed me.
Mar 05 16:46:47 <naokotani>	I've been vegetarian since..... about 2010
Mar 05 16:46:57 <Fade>	I don't produce the enzyme that allows my body to extract protein from plants.
Mar 05 16:47:16 <Fade>	which is very common among native american people, and more common the further north you go.
Mar 05 16:47:35 <naokotani>	I am not native american in the slightest
Mar 05 16:47:46 <Fade>	so being a vegitarian made me fat and sick, which isn't what the promo material says on the brochure.
Mar 05 16:48:08 <Fade>	I am.
Mar 05 16:48:30 <Fade>	genetically. physically I'm straight out of central casting for the role of Irish Thug.
Mar 05 16:48:55 <naokotani>	I don't find it really had much effect on my weight one way or another
Mar 05 16:49:04 <naokotani>	actually, I didn't notice any difference at all
Mar 05 16:49:08 <naokotani>	on any level
Mar 05 16:49:34 <Fade>	being vegitarian has lots of benefits, just none of them were conducive to me staying alive.
Mar 05 16:49:56 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 05 16:50:03 <naokotani>	It's mostly religous for me
Mar 05 16:50:06 <naokotani>	religous reasons
Mar 05 16:50:30 <naokotani>	though if it has health benefits thats great I guess
Mar 05 16:50:55 <Fade>	once I was cured of catholicism, I found no need for the religionz.
Mar 05 16:51:56 <Fade>	I think everybody should do what makes them right with the world, so long as it doesn't become a proscription about me.
Mar 05 16:52:03 <naokotani>	I was raised atheist but I struggled with existential dread so I started practicing buddhism and I found it helped a lot
Mar 05 16:52:05 <visl>	i was vegetarian for a spell too, it also made me fat and sick but it's probably because i didn't prioritize actual vegetables. i was a bread and cheese vegetarian
Mar 05 16:52:42 <Fade>	I was pretty serious. I went to a nutritionist, and followed the prescribed diet, uhm, religiously.
Mar 05 16:52:49 <Fade>	and I still wound up fat and sick.
Mar 05 16:53:05 <naokotani>	I mostly eat potatoes
Mar 05 16:53:16 <Fade>	potatoes are a nearly perfect food.
Mar 05 16:53:18 <naokotani>	and I feel fine
Mar 05 16:53:28 <naokotani>	I knew a guy who only ate bananas for 12 yeras
Mar 05 16:53:39 <naokotani>	he had no eyebrows,b ut otherwise seemed very healthy for 78
Mar 05 16:53:45 <Fade>	naokotani: I assume you have a fairly standard western european genetic profile?
Mar 05 16:54:08 <naokotani>	Fade: incredibly
Mar 05 16:54:26 <Fade>	yeah. most of the militant dieticians I've met have been white euros.
Mar 05 16:54:58 <naokotani>	I think the whole nutrition thing is largely a red herring
Mar 05 16:55:02 <naokotani>	msotly what you need is prana
Mar 05 16:55:05 <Fade>	they get very annoyed with me when I point out their imperialist agression, largely because they're also white liberals.
Mar 05 16:55:26 <naokotani>	I am very much not a liberal
Mar 05 16:55:42 <Fade>	no, you're a tankie. we've already had this conversation. :)
Mar 05 16:55:54 <naokotani>	yes, dyed in the wool tankie
Mar 05 16:56:04 <Fade>	I doubt the vangard would have much time for your musings about prana. 
Mar 05 16:56:05 <Fade>	lol
Mar 05 16:56:06 <Marvin2>	I doubt I will use two editors at once?
Mar 05 16:56:29 <alternateved>	Well, everything is possible
Mar 05 16:56:43 <naokotani>	idk, the soviet union had some pretty out there science
Mar 05 16:57:12 <naokotani>	they probably thought nutrition was bourgois 
Mar 05 16:58:11 <naokotani>	actaully interestingly, Yoga is extremely popular all over the former soviet countries. Russia and India still have a very strong relationship
Mar 05 16:58:52 <naokotani>	I am not even going to begin to try to explain what they have in common.
Mar 05 17:00:38 <naokotani>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism
Mar 05 17:00:41 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/pVYGI ]::[ Lysenkoism - Wikipedia ]
Mar 05 17:01:49 <naokotani>	I also think the whole concept of a vanguard party is sort of red herring. for example. in liberal democracy we have a vanguard party composed of the business and political elites
Mar 05 17:03:26 <Fade>	in a socialist revolution the theory is that the vangard delivers the revolution to the peasants, and then educates them enough to devolve control of the party to the proletariat.
Mar 05 17:03:33 <Fade>	in practice, this has never happened.
Mar 05 17:04:02 <naokotani>	the issue is that its virtually impossible to not have a politcal vanguard in all but the smallest societies
Mar 05 17:05:57 <naokotani>	running society requires a high degree of speacialized knoweldge, just like any other field.
Mar 05 17:06:08 <Fade>	I don't think that's true, and I would cite the success of free software and of Mondragon in spain as specific examples, but this kind of discussion is not suited to a medium as low bandwidth as irc.
Mar 05 17:06:34 <naokotani>	well who runs free software? clearly the software development vaguard
Mar 05 17:06:37 <naokotani>	its not the general public
Mar 05 17:07:26 <naokotani>	you have a vaguard of cohort of people with highly speicalized knowlege that create free software and direct the course of its development
Mar 05 17:07:34 <Fade>	I think the only system that hasn't been actually attempted is federated anarchist mutual aid cells. of course, that requires an educated engaged society and some smart fascists basically made sure that wouldn't happen about fifty years ago.
Mar 05 17:08:51 <naokotani>	In an ideal society you want a highly educated society that is informed about what political specialists are up to in general terms, but not to a point that it detracts from their ability to perform their own function in society which will require some other form of specialzied knowledge
Mar 05 17:08:54 <Marvin2>	In an emumeration for the summer
Mar 05 17:09:36 <Fade>	so... it looks like the entirety of Meta is down.
Mar 05 17:09:44 <naokotani>	finally some good news
Mar 05 17:09:50 <Fade>	facebook, intagram, messenger
Mar 05 17:10:02 <naokotani>	so there is a god. a minute ago you were an atheist
Mar 05 17:10:03 <Fade>	their VR headsets are all offline.
Mar 05 17:10:21 <naokotani>	There is a god and he took some time out of his day to smite down facebook
Mar 05 17:11:12 <Fade>	my inner operator is running scenarios attempting to picture what could have teken down their entire footprint.
Mar 05 17:11:40 <Fade>	this is something that really shouldn't happen
Mar 05 17:11:42 <Marvin2>	this is coming :P
Mar 05 17:11:47 <Fade>	also, true.
Mar 05 17:12:01 <naokotani>	It seems like ther eis no good reasonw hy all of meta needs to be connected to the point this could hapen
Mar 05 17:12:26 <naokotani>	like why isn't instagram and facebook on totally diffirent infrastrucutre?
Mar 05 17:12:27 <Fade>	optimisation under profit concentrates data centres
Mar 05 17:12:34 <naokotani>	true
Mar 05 17:13:01 <naokotani>	well they have been having trouble making money of late. maybe they cut one too many corner
Mar 05 17:13:04 <Fade>	it's easier to heat and cool a really large data centre(s) than it is to have many implementations of the same infrastructure.
Mar 05 17:13:12 <Fade>	also, cheaper.
Mar 05 17:13:38 <naokotani>	while I can see that normally, i would think they are just so huge that it would be fine to have at least two
Mar 05 17:14:13 <Fade>	they have many hundreds.
Mar 05 17:14:30 <Fade>	the scale of that machine is so vast, it really cannot be understood by a single person.
Mar 05 17:14:44 <naokotani>	could be a geopolitcal enenmy of the US did it
Mar 05 17:15:15 <Fade>	on the balance of odds, I'd say somebody somewhere righteously fucked up the BGP routing tables.
Mar 05 17:15:27 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 05 17:15:49 <Fade>	leading to whatever insane storage system they're using for concrete state to go bad.
Mar 05 17:15:58 <Fade>	</guess>
Mar 05 17:17:25 <naokotani>	oh
Mar 05 17:17:31 <naokotani>	appanretly its osmethign to do with authentication
Mar 05 17:17:46 <Fade>	yep
Mar 05 17:17:47 <naokotani>	which acutally makes sense that that is cross platform
Mar 05 17:18:16 <Fade>	remember kids, PHP is good enough for facebook!
Mar 05 17:18:20 <naokotani>	maybe somebody accidetnally wrote drop table passwords;
Mar 05 17:19:08 <Fade>	little bobby tables grew up and got a job
Mar 05 17:19:28 <naokotani>	ooohh did you say create table crosswords? i thought you said drop table passwords; opps
Mar 05 17:21:55 <Fade>	https://phys.org/news/2024-03-high-temperature-superconducting-magnets-ready.html

Mar 05 17:22:11 <Fade>	20 tesla! wild
Mar 05 17:25:46 <Fade>	I wish i could still buy SPARC computers that weren't used.
Mar 05 17:26:04 <Fade>	I guess fujitsu is still making them for asian markets.
Mar 05 17:26:13 <Fade>	but not to the standards that Sun did.
Mar 05 17:30:14 <trev>	would you run Marvin3 on it?
Mar 05 17:30:34 <Fade>	on what?
Mar 05 17:31:12 <Fade>	Marvin3 runs on a lisp machine called sbcl. it in turn could run on just about any CPU from the past thirty years.
Mar 05 17:31:24 <Fade>	well, anything from the pentium onward.
Mar 05 17:31:42 <Fade>	but I'd have no trouble running my entire computational world on Sparc.
Mar 05 17:31:58 <Fade>	the hardware was as robust as any ever made.
Mar 05 17:32:22 <Fade>	s/3/2
Mar 05 17:32:38 <trev>	on the SPARC
Mar 05 17:32:49 <Fade>	for sure
Mar 05 17:32:56 <Fade>	sparc systems were great.
Mar 05 17:33:14 <Fade>	there was a time when over 70% of the internet ran on sparc machines.
Mar 05 17:33:58 <Fade>	step 1: incorporate company. step 2: get funding. step 3: call Sun Microsystems
Mar 05 17:34:04 <Fade>	i'm not even being hyperbolic.
Mar 05 17:34:05 <Fade>	lol
Mar 05 17:34:54 <Fade>	it's kind of amazing they managed to fuck that company up to the point where it doesn't exist any more.
Mar 05 17:35:00 <glenneth>	Fade: a 20,000 pound magnet.  That's insane
Mar 05 17:35:07 <Fade>	glenneth: right?
Mar 05 17:35:40 <glenneth>	brilliant, but insane
Mar 05 17:35:56 <Fade>	I love that kind of large scale engineering
Mar 05 17:38:21 <glenneth>	are you following this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER
Mar 05 17:38:25 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/wsChz ]::[ ITER - Wikipedia ]
Mar 05 17:39:14 <glenneth>	tokamak reactor in Europe
Mar 05 17:42:01 <Fade>	absolutely
Mar 05 17:42:33 <glenneth>	firing up
Mar 05 17:42:56 <glenneth>	the end of next year
Mar 05 17:43:04 <Fade>	iter is one of the projects that gives me some modicum of hope for my species.
Mar 05 17:43:15 <glenneth>	yup
Mar 05 17:43:23 <glenneth>	either
Mar 05 17:43:54 <glenneth>	it works or the planet implodes
Mar 05 17:43:57 <shom>	I know we've moved on peanut butter but I just want to say this comment made me unreasonably amused. Fade :I died once, and my mother made me walk it off.
Mar 05 17:43:59 <Marvin2>	I know a bit part of "the south")
Mar 05 17:44:00 <Fade>	the americans have been making some real advancements in plasma control systems which are likely to really buff ITER.
Mar 05 17:44:19 <glenneth>	i'm good either way :)
Mar 05 17:44:24 <Fade>	totally
Mar 05 17:44:26 <Fade>	shom: :D
Mar 05 17:46:27 <glenneth>	going to eat.  I may be back o7
Mar 05 17:46:30 <shom>	Also glenneth glad I could help, I never get to help in system crafters 😂. Your first post could be the first post for every static site generator blog: how I build my static blog
Mar 05 17:46:38 <Marvin2>	Also glenneth glad I could recommend emacs, but im not sure if I stay on their good side and get the links to get as much good code as I might to use a "normal" keyboard
Mar 05 17:47:51 <glenneth>	shom: you will be credited in the titles :)
Mar 05 17:48:07 <glenneth>	laters
Mar 05 17:48:26 <shom>	Oh gosh, please no. I don't want to be held responsible. Hahaha. 👋🏽

Mar 05 19:06:18 <sahil_1>	why am I getting the regular tab complete list in the minibuffer, and not vertico related popup. And is there any package like mason.nvim for emacs?
Mar 05 19:06:46 <Fade>	is vertico installed?
Mar 05 19:07:12 <sahil_>	yes
Mar 05 19:07:31 <sahil_>	vertico-mode enabled as well
Mar 05 19:07:56 <Fade>	are there any related messages in the messages or warnings buffers?
Mar 05 19:09:29 <sahil_>	nothing other than "Making completion list ..."
Mar 05 19:14:45 <Fade>	dunno. can you manually start it with M-x vertico-mode
Mar 05 19:14:45 <Fade>	?
Mar 05 19:26:13 <sahil_>	Fade: Yes (sorry for the delay)
Mar 05 19:26:21 <sahil_>	that's what I did to confirm 
Mar 05 19:26:38 <Fade>	something you installed is overriding the completion interface.
Mar 05 19:26:42 <Fade>	</guess>
Mar 05 19:28:06 <sahil_>	https://termbin.com/5726
Mar 05 19:28:06 <sahil_>	here is the config. 
Mar 05 19:28:10 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/GmflV ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 05 19:28:18 <sahil_>	some cleanup is required so don't judge
Mar 05 19:35:07 <Fade>	I don't think your org file is healthy. 
Mar 05 19:35:16 <Fade>	I just tried to tangle it and I'm getting a failure.
Mar 05 19:36:06 <Fade>	what is in init.el?
Mar 05 19:36:22 <Fade>	does org-babel-tangle-file work for you?
Mar 05 19:40:14 <benoitj>	hey Fade sahil_ 
Mar 05 19:40:48 <Fade>	I don't have the fonts or the theems to load this config.
Mar 05 19:41:06 <Fade>	I suggest you bisect the packages to find out what is overwriting your expected completion regime.
Mar 05 19:41:09 <Fade>	heya, benoitj 
Mar 05 19:41:45 <Fade>	sahil_: it's possible that the config isn't loading all the way through.
Mar 05 19:51:44 <sahil_>	Fade: let me check
Mar 05 19:52:44 <sahil_>	I see this warning https://termbin.com/2p0a But I don't think that it's fatal
Mar 05 19:52:48 <Marvin2>	[ http://outrider.deepsky.com:5808/HYpUc ]::[ No title found ]
Mar 05 19:53:38 <sahil_>	yes it tangled all the way through
Mar 05 19:54:21 <Fade>	that doesn't mean the resulting elisp file loaded correctly
Mar 05 19:54:30 <Fade>	considering we have some evidence that it hasn't.
Mar 05 19:54:33 <Marvin2>	considering we have a single pane
Mar 05 19:54:37 <Fade>	bisect the packages.
Mar 05 19:55:23 <sahil_>	Fade: at it

Mar 05 22:33:15 <Fade>	it's not ezzackly 'usable' by any modern standard even when it's functioning perfectly.
Mar 05 22:33:18 <Fade>	:)
Mar 05 22:33:24 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 05 22:33:56 <Fade>	but, if you have a lot of text to edit, and all you have is a teletype, it's just the thing.
Mar 05 22:36:23 <naokotani>	I thought there was a way to send all your inputs the the terminal buffer so you could use vim and seuch
Mar 05 22:37:05 <Fade>	vi(m) assumes a lot of terminal facilities that are not present prior to about 1977.
Mar 05 22:37:29 <naokotani>	prior of after?
Mar 05 22:38:44 <naokotani>	I thought I could use nvim in eat, but it doesn't appear overly usable
Mar 05 22:39:04 <naokotani>	it tells me the buffer is read only when im in normal mode
Mar 05 22:39:16 <naokotani>	but I can enter text in insert mode
Mar 05 22:39:37 <rdbeni0>	when I am in a rich emacs session, i.e. I have many buffers open, some of them are shell + ssh (vterm most often) and sometimes I need to quickly edit something remotely. nano/vim do not work properly with emacs shells, they can even lock up because of an input conflict. Hence the idea for `ed`
Mar 05 22:39:49 <Fade>	prior
Mar 05 22:41:13 <naokotani>	you can use tramp
Mar 05 22:41:29 <naokotani>	you can use tramp to open files in emacs buffers remotely, it works using ssh
Mar 05 22:41:32 <Marvin2>	you can check the bot's state :)
Mar 05 22:41:40 <naokotani>	yeah marvin, we know
Mar 05 22:42:04 <rdbeni0>	hmm, need to check how  to switch from vterm to tramp
Mar 05 22:42:23 <Fade>	just open the file using tramp syntax
Mar 05 22:43:00 <rdbeni0>	ok thanks for the idea, i will try
Mar 05 22:43:06 <Fade>	c-x c-f /ssh:rdbeni0@remotehost.com:/path/to/the/file/you/want/to/edit.org
Mar 05 22:43:41 <Fade>	or give it a path denoting a directory and emacs will open dired in that path.
Mar 05 22:44:36 <naokotani>	Tramp doesn't always work flawlessly, but I feel like its going ot be a better experience than ed, or nano for that matter
Mar 05 22:44:55 <naokotani>	I am sure there are so nano wizards out there that could prove me wrong though
Mar 05 22:45:03 <Fade>	i've seen you complain about tramp before, but I love it.
Mar 05 22:46:55 <rdbeni0>	ok,ok thanks guys. I had some issues with tramp in the past because it left some of his env manipulations in bash history, and our servers are monitored very strictly and I would like to avoid too "suspicious" commands in session history.
Mar 05 22:47:27 <rdbeni0>	but meaby i will recheck it now

Mar 06 02:13:32 <tdback>	nm0i: the second edition of the book is great too! I remember watching a presentation a few years back about awk and its impact on perl/ruby/etc. It sits right next to sed, grep, netcat, and a slew of others in my toolbox
Mar 06 02:13:36 <Marvin2>	nm0i: the second
Mar 06 02:14:28 <tdback>	I personally compile the onetrueawk instead of gawk, but that's just me being picky
Mar 06 02:14:31 <Marvin2>	I personally compile the onetrueawk instead of linkedin they would have damaged your mind.
Mar 06 02:14:51 <tdback>	Fade: Marvin2 is... evolving
Mar 06 03:39:14 <naokotani>	well, im the proud new owner of light mode
Mar 06 04:01:06 <trev>	naokotani: which one?
Mar 06 04:12:27 <naokotani>	oh just my blog
Mar 06 04:12:35 <naokotani>	i made light mode today fo rit
Mar 06 04:12:42 <naokotani>	and fixed some other crap css
Mar 06 04:17:20 <benoitj>	I think mine adjust to browser prefs

Mar 06 04:23:32 <benoitj>	streaming is what the kids use
Mar 06 04:23:44 <naokotani>	ok, maybe I will try that then
Mar 06 04:23:45 <Marvin2>	ok, maybe I will see the point that it hasn't.
Mar 06 04:23:58 <benoitj>	probably going to watch it in the imax theater
Mar 06 04:24:21 <naokotani>	the nearest imax is like 3.5 hours away
Mar 06 04:24:59 <benoitj>	that is far
Mar 06 04:25:19 <benoitj>	cant have the view, the nature, and an imax theater :P
Mar 06 04:25:22 <Marvin2>	cant have the same time, I started practicing buddhism and I dont restart emacs often, so it doesn't become a crew member
Mar 06 04:25:29 <naokotani>	lol
Mar 06 04:25:32 <benoitj>	haha
Mar 06 04:25:56 <naokotani>	I started practicing buddhism and I don't restart emacs often should be on my tomb stone
Mar 06 04:26:06 <benoitj>	hehe
Mar 06 04:26:17 <benoitj>	emacs-uptime: 
Mar 06 04:26:26 <benoitj>	14 days 13 hours
Mar 06 04:26:37 <naokotani>	its acutally only 14 hours
Mar 06 04:26:51 <naokotani>	I can't recall why... oh
Mar 06 04:27:02 <naokotani>	I swticehd from zellij to tmux 14 hours ago
Mar 06 04:27:03 <benoitj>	reload your config is typically why I restart
Mar 06 04:27:15 <benoitj>	my other emacs is 7 days 7 hours
Mar 06 04:27:51 <naokotani>	and I usually end up running emacs in the terminal because..... otherwise it can't find the path
Mar 06 04:27:54 <naokotani>	because wsl
Mar 06 04:28:01 <benoitj>	oh
Mar 06 04:28:18 <benoitj>	when all you use is emacs, wsl is not too bad
Mar 06 04:28:40 <naokotani>	yeah
Mar 06 04:28:44 <naokotani>	I mean I use the terminal a lot
Mar 06 04:28:50 <benoitj>	ok
Mar 06 04:28:51 <naokotani>	and ssh for servers
Mar 06 04:29:03 <benoitj>	I use emacs a lot <--- emacs is my terminal
Mar 06 04:29:34 <naokotani>	I use them interchangeably
Mar 06 04:29:35 <benoitj>	since I used RDE, I got the habit of using emacs vterm. need to develop eshell too, but havent adopted it yet
Mar 06 04:29:48 <benoitj>	I have an old fork of st I still use
Mar 06 04:29:58 <benoitj>	but mostly to debug my emacs :P
Mar 06 04:30:10 <naokotani>	usually I edit files in emacs
Mar 06 04:30:47 <naokotani>	I find it a little faster to move around the filesystem in teh terminal
Mar 06 04:30:54 <naokotani>	though, overall I like dired
Mar 06 04:31:38 <benoitj>	yeah, dired is pretty good
Mar 06 04:31:57 <benoitj>	terminal + fzf is pretty nice
Mar 06 04:32:01 <naokotani>	I really like the dwim cp/mv
Mar 06 04:32:10 <benoitj>	yeah
Mar 06 04:33:02 <naokotani>	and
Mar 06 04:33:17 <naokotani>	I usually end up compiling and whatnot in the termial

Mar 06 05:38:46 <apoorv569>	Anybody else on Guix facing problem with `evil-mode` (Emacs) after recently Guix update (if managing emacs packages form Guix)?
Mar 06 05:40:04 <apoorv569>	I am having this problem where something happens to evil-mode where I can't go back to normal mode, to like scroll or move back and forward, I have to disable and enable evil-mode again to make it work.
Mar 06 05:40:34 <apoorv569>	And its like so frequent every other word I type make evil-mode crap out.
Mar 06 05:41:15 <apoorv569>	I don't see any errors, I just see this in message buffer,
Mar 06 05:41:23 <apoorv569>	Error running timer ‘corfu--auto-complete-deferred’: (wrong-number-of-arguments #<subr evil-normalize-keymaps> 4)
Mar 06 05:50:45 <glenneth>	hey apoorv569 
Mar 06 05:51:04 <benoitj>	tried running -Q and loading the module?
Mar 06 05:55:10 <apoorv569>	Hello glenneth
Mar 06 07:04:15 <apoorv569>	I ran `emacs` with `-Q`, then I `(require 'evil-core)` `(use-package evil-mode)`
Mar 06 07:04:37 <apoorv569>	It refuses to enable the mode. the module is loaded though.
Mar 06 07:10:50 <benoitj>	broken cache?
Mar 06 07:15:02 <apoorv569>	I'll clean my emacs cache one time to make sure.
