Feb 22 19:13:54 <heistema>	Hi, does anybody of known issues with the Emacs arch packages? I reinstalled my PC and emacs fails parsing my config... I cannot find the error message anywhere on the internet or the docs...
Feb 22 19:16:55 <heistema>	While downloading packages he hangs and nags about 1.) eglot required 1.0.24 AND 2.) jsonrpc (1 0 16) lower than min. I thought eglot is installed with emacs and install-package does not find any jsonrpc package...
Feb 22 19:18:11 <heistema>	Why does he download a package which according to the docs is included in core? Eglot is only mentioned once in my config, in a use-package clause... But use-package does not download any packages, right?
Feb 22 19:33:32 <heistema>	upgrade-eglot-upgrade does not work either... I also cannot find any further error message.
Feb 22 19:33:57 <heistema>	Is there any drop-in replacement for emacs which one might use to read / write org-mode files (just as long my emacs is broken)?

Feb 22 21:20:26 <heistema>	Okay, update on my concern ... The emacs download linebreaking was misinterpreted by me... It is only one issue with jsonrpc NOT with eglot
Feb 22 21:22:43 <heistema>	I somehow need to update the package jsonrpc which is according to emacs nonexistent
Feb 22 23:00:12 <heistema>	It is weird that the very same config does run on my computer with emacs 29.2 and does not run my laptop with emacs 29.2, as well
Feb 23 00:52:48 <Thermoriax>	good luck. :)

Feb 24 16:35:18 <corwin>	heistema: what version of Emacs are you using?  Did you compile it yourself or else how did you get your binaries?
Feb 24 16:35:41 <corwin>	(Is this doom or spacemacs or neovim or something, or just regular GNU Emacs?)
Feb 24 16:37:37 <corwin>	heistema: assuming your config was working file but now isn't it's likely you are hitting some new bug with elgot.  The usual move in that case is to create a set of minimum steps to reproduce the error and then create a bug report, ideally from an Emacs -Q session where you run M-x report-emacs-bug RET right after reproducing the error.
Feb 24 16:37:43 <heistema>	corwin: First i tried with the 29.2 from the arch repo (pacman) and now I have cloned and compiled the 29.2 on my own
Feb 24 16:38:13 <corwin>	If some configuration is needed to reproduce then we usually create a minimal config that has just enough to reproduce the problem.
Feb 24 16:38:58 <heistema>	corwin: Hold on I will strap my config...
Feb 24 16:39:01 <corwin>	heistema: so, you get the same issues using arch as from self building the release branch?  Have you tried either/both without your config (e.g. using emacs -Q to start it)?
Feb 24 16:39:03 <corwin>	coo
Feb 24 16:39:17 <corwin>	I might have to wonder AFK but there are plenty of others who can help.
Feb 24 16:49:57 <heistema>	:corwin Thanks corwin! I narrowed the error down at the point that it everything goes flawlessly until I run my elpaca setup script... Somewhere in there the eglot error gets thrown
Feb 24 17:10:22 <heistema>	Okay I think I know the error now but not how to resolve it: I install elpaca, I then install elpaca-use-package and later I use (use-package eglot ...) in my config. The moment Elpaca starts to load the eglot package he starts to nag about the jsonrpc to low version
Feb 24 17:10:29 <corwin>	heistema: seems most probably an issue with elpaca then.  You could use ,,paste,, to show your config for that and maybe someone who's used it could weigh in.  You might find more ppl using elpaca in #emacs
Feb 24 17:10:30 <fsbot>	Please do not paste more than three lines into the channel. Use a pastebin like https://bpa.st/+emacs-lisp
Feb 24 17:14:33 <heistema>	corwin: Thanks again, corwin... So I should post in #emacs then? And of course I will use pastebin ;-)

Mar 02 11:58:10 <Guest68>	Hello, I apologize in advance. On mobile with a short question. Calc to minimize one parameter in a group of two equations. Found no more references than the short description on the online manual. Will be this the right place where to ask for feedback? Once I tried. Thanks.
Mar 02 12:54:42 <Guest68>	Missed something? On guest account
Mar 02 13:01:25 <wasamasa>	no, there's been no activity
Mar 02 13:03:23 <Guest68>	Thanks for answering. It will timeout eventually
Mar 02 13:04:23 <wasamasa>	probably a better idea to ask on #emacs
Mar 02 13:05:00 <Guest68>	Thanks again

Mar 06 07:40:41 <piyush_24>	Hello,
Mar 06 07:41:54 <piyush_24>	I am having trouble with my config and although lsp-mode is installed but it still doesn't open up in a C file (I have also configured lsp-clangd)
Mar 06 07:42:51 <piyush_24>	I am getting an error although with `counsel-projectile` package. Could that be hindering lsp-mode?
Mar 06 07:47:26 <bpalmer>	It's possible. What's the error?
Mar 06 07:47:56 <bpalmer>	and, what is your configuration that would run lsp ? Are you using eglot or lsp-ui?
Mar 06 07:50:19 <piyush_24>	the counsel-projectile error is simple: Error (use-package): Cannot load counsel-projectile
Mar 06 07:52:29 <piyush_24>	However, i just commented out the counsel-projectile section, there is still no lsp-mode
Mar 06 07:53:57 <piyush_24>	bpalmer: I am not using eglot, using `lsp-mode`
Mar 06 07:56:38 <bpalmer>	piyush_24: what happens if you do M-x lsp RET
Mar 06 07:58:41 <piyush_24>	bplamer: that gives me the option to import the project root and starts clangd once I import it.
Mar 06 07:59:38 <piyush_24>	However, this option lsp, in the M-x mini buffer was not available as long as I had the `use-package counsel-projectile` line in my config
Mar 06 07:59:42 <bpalmer>	piyush_24: so it sounds like you need to add a call to lsp to your major mode hook
Mar 06 07:59:49 <bpalmer>	something like (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'lsp)
Mar 06 08:03:56 <piyush_24>	I have this in my config:   :hook (((c-mode c++-mode objc-mode) . lsp-deferred)
Mar 06 08:04:05 <piyush_24>	I guess the deferred is causing the issue?
Mar 06 08:06:14 <bpalmer>	ah. I don't know lsp-deferred.
Mar 06 08:06:27 <bpalmer>	also make sure you're not using c-ts-mode (which uses treesitter)
Mar 06 08:06:33 <piyush_24>	Also counsel-projectile is a valid package. In fact its also avaialable in `M-x package-list-packages`, why would I get this error: Error (use-package): Cannot load counsel-projectile
Mar 06 08:06:36 <bpalmer>	C-h v major-mode RET 
Mar 06 08:06:55 <bpalmer>	piyush_24: I don't know. I'd suggest tackling one problem at a time, though.
Mar 06 08:07:19 <piyush_24>	I am using c-ts-mode, why is it not recommended?
Mar 06 08:07:51 <bpalmer>	it's fine, but c-ts-mode is not in that list you write, only c-mode
Mar 06 08:07:55 <bpalmer>	you can try adding it there
Mar 06 08:09:02 <piyush_24>	I have a separate list for c-ts-mode. 
Mar 06 08:09:57 <bpalmer>	so you add lsp-deferred to c-ts-mode-hook ?
Mar 06 08:10:58 <piyush_24>	I do
Mar 06 08:11:21 <piyush_24>	I just checked, apparently lsp-deferred is an optimization option, to not enable lsp until required
Mar 06 08:13:12 <bpalmer>	ok, and C-h v c-ts-mode-hook RET shows that it is there?
