Dec 11 19:33:09 <kevin-oculus>	can this be battery issue started messing with the screen going off a bit when it feels like it. Sometimes it works great and sometimes the screen goes out, but then you still hear sound or phone calls. If you let it rest for 1-2 minutes, it starts again.

Feb 20 18:21:39 <pekster>	BullHorn: There are *many* bugs in macOS these days. There's virtually no bug-squashing or Q/A that goes on internally, so buggy, untested crap gets shipped. You can file Feedback, but good luck getting any of them noticed. Mine stay open for months (over a year for 4 of them.) Never a reply.
Feb 20 18:28:11 <pekster>	You can always record video reproducing the problem and write clear reproduction steps, explaining the severe usability problems this causes. If you do it for every broken thing you can easily end up with dozens of reports per month, adding to the thousands of other bugs that Apple will just ignore. I've filed a handful for Shortcuts.app, which is some 3rd party product formerly known as 'Workflow'.
Feb 20 18:28:59 <pekster>	'Workflow' was clearly bought for the iOS market, and Apple's basically ignored *glaring* bugs in the macOS version. It's so buggy to be a complete joke of a feature, yet the company fired the lead staffer behind the previous automation framework, 'Automator'
Feb 20 18:31:07 <pekster>	Par for the course with Apple. Buy some half-baked product, fire the folks who worked on the old (mostly working) product you don't like anymore, and then fail to support the new one.
Feb 20 18:31:49 <pekster>	"Embrace, extend, extinguish." (the 3 E's.) -- that used to be the joke for Microsoft's mantra, but Apple's been doing it for some years.
Feb 20 18:44:20 <BullHorn>	i sent a lot of feedback for every Apple device and only got a response once, when it was about apple watch beta software heart rate tracking
Feb 20 18:44:31 <BullHorn>	i sent >50 feedbacks, most of them are still open
Feb 20 18:44:59 <pekster>	Exactly.
Feb 20 18:45:23 <pekster>	Some here will tell you how Apple values every (well-written) feedback and devs take great pride in clearing them out. It's nonsense.
Feb 20 18:46:42 <pekster>	If you want action on an issue you thing can gain general-interest (or at least attention) on the Internet, your only real option is to post to a very public place about the flaw, such as HN or other similar outlets. If your gripes go viral, you just might embarrass Apple into fixing it.
Feb 20 18:49:25 <pekster>	I just hit a UI bug right now in fact; a window refuses to resize unless I am on exactly *one* pixel of the window edge (it's supposed to be many more pixels than that.)
Feb 20 18:51:00 <pekster>	Cute, opening a new window in that instance is equally broken (so I can't just Command-N and drag the 4 open tabs over.) What a lousy OS.
Feb 20 20:38:02 <Lyle42>	I have over 20 friends who are software engineers at Apple, what I said about radars is direct from the horses mouth
Feb 20 20:38:15 <Lyle42>	getting publicity for a bug is also helpful
Feb 20 20:45:08 <circuitbone>	I don't have 20 friends at apple. I use unix / linux distros as servers for more important aspects of my digital lifestyle. copium
Feb 20 20:46:37 <Lyle42>	use the tech that fits your needs, i say
Feb 20 20:47:02 <Lyle42>	my most used tool is a text editor
Feb 20 20:47:06 <MollyLucy>	could you help me getting a safari extension published on apple app store without subscription Lyle42 plss :D
Feb 20 20:49:01 <Lyle42>	if you can't manage a $100 developer subscription maybe your work should stay where it is
Feb 20 20:49:50 <Lyle42>	getting products onto an app store is not rocket science
Feb 20 20:52:47 <MollyLucy>	he doesnt want to help, or he lied
Feb 20 20:52:50 <MollyLucy>	ban him!
Feb 20 20:52:57 <MollyLucy>	:D
Feb 20 20:54:11 <circuitbone>	Most of the world lives on $4 a day or less. I doubt someone from Indonesia cares too much about delivering solutions to an app store. They rent the latest hardware from the telco and make do with the current `race to the bottom`  free solutions they can find scrubbing search engines, until that business model runs out of cash. Not the most secure, or long term plan but that is the way it is for the majority of users today.
Feb 20 20:55:10 <Lyle42>	i don't dispute that, my point is if you have something that can sell even a little on an app store, you will make a fair bit more than the $100 required for a developer membership
Feb 20 20:55:37 <circuitbone>	99/1 law, most apps don't return a profit at all. 1% would.
Feb 20 20:55:39 <MollyLucy>	not for sell, for free!
Feb 20 20:56:43 <circuitbone>	That gets tighter as the larger players fill up the top of the store with deals. McDonalds was given a free top tier position without any hard work and most of the stuff we produced was garbage.
Feb 20 20:57:45 <Brains>	G'day.
Feb 20 20:57:50 <MollyLucy>	hi Brains!

Feb 20 20:59:18 <Lyle42>	the app store sales distribution does follow a Pareto distribution, it's not quite as bad as 99/100
Feb 20 20:59:23 <circuitbone>	My evidence is not heresay
Feb 20 21:00:19 <circuitbone>	99/1 is common in all these platforms. Apple store, Android Store, steam / spotify and they are all well gamified at this point by cheating or business coercion.
Feb 20 21:01:34 <circuitbone>	scamification ™ look ma I made a new word ;)
Feb 20 21:02:38 <Lyle42>	everything i've submitted has made at least some money, and i don't have any friends who have made nothing on their submissions, and we compare notes, including friends who have top selling apps, i conclude that a lot of total junk is thrown onto the store.  if you put a good effort out, you will make at least some money
Feb 20 21:02:49 <circuitbone>	conjecture time.
Feb 20 21:03:54 <Lyle42>	i've been at #6 on the Mac App Store, a friend has spent months at #1 (Growl, now sherlocked)
Feb 20 21:07:55 <circuitbone>	Even github stars have been commodified.
Feb 20 21:09:28 <Lyle42>	marketing does make all the difference, if you have something solid to sell
Feb 20 21:09:56 <Lyle42>	that is not my strong suit, i keep trying to code my way out of marketing problems
Feb 20 21:11:07 <circuitbone>	https://the-guild.dev/_next/static/media/cheap-stars-reciept.3109e883.png capitalising higher up on the delusion chain happens.
Feb 20 21:12:07 <Lyle42>	yep, there a photos of review farms with banks of phones mounted on racks
Feb 20 21:12:42 <circuitbone>	yup, like farms.
Feb 20 21:17:31 <circuitbone>	listen farms are more profitable at the moment until that market saturates with the scamming fishball.
Feb 20 21:22:12 <circuitbone>	fraudulent practices, perpetuated and ignored because it affects profit in the higher level fraudulent practice. https://cheq.ai/blog/click-fraud-statistics-2023/ ¬ø¬
Feb 20 22:22:57 <pekster>	Another UX failure: I foolishly entered some wifi passwords directly into the macOS prompt to connect, and desire to export them (you can already view entries one-at-a-time with a password prompt before EACH one.) Turns out: you can't! The Keychain Access.app has greyed out the 'Export Items' entry.
Feb 20 22:23:26 <pekster>	https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/import-and-export-keychain-items-kyca35961/mac explains, "If the Export Items menu is dimmed, at least one of the selected items can’t be exported." -- well, that's wrong. They can be exported. Just manually. What a stupid, STUPID limitation, promoting vendor lock-in.
Feb 20 22:23:56 *	pekster files Feedback, so that Apple can ignore this. Why would they pay their developers to make it easier to use anything that's not an Apple product in the name of allowing users to access their own data?
Feb 20 22:24:12 <circuitbone>	You can always stop using a commercial product.
Feb 20 22:24:52 <circuitbone>	Are you held at gunpoint? Or expressing sunk cost fallacy?.
Feb 20 22:33:37 <pekster>	Some of us use multiple platforms regurlarly. What a poor way to ask the question, under the presumption that I must be using this product since I (in your mind, anyway) have no choice but to do so.
Feb 20 22:34:27 <circuitbone>	Curiosity more than anything, listening to whine and complain a lot gets a little long in the tooth.
Feb 20 22:34:30 <pekster>	Some people care enough to point out flaws in the hope they get fixed. A fleeting hope, in the case of Apple.
Feb 20 22:34:49 <pekster>	Feel free to offer suggestions or solutions to these problems.
Feb 20 22:35:03 <circuitbone>	Read above.
Feb 20 22:36:11 <pekster>	How does that help export my current passwords that aren't anywhere else?
Feb 20 22:36:32 <circuitbone>	Single point of failure hey?
Feb 20 22:37:05 <pekster>	More assumptions on your part (and you'd be wrong.)
Feb 20 22:37:15 <pekster>	You really are a winner today for condesending "help", huh?
Feb 20 22:37:46 <circuitbone>	I am just asking questions and you are being ridiculous :)
Feb 20 22:38:14 <pekster>	No, you're suggesting I have these backed up nowhere else. You'd be wrong, they just aren't backed up anywhere that doesn't limit me to Apple's ecosystem.
Feb 20 22:38:22 <pekster>	That wasn't a question by the way.
Feb 20 22:39:01 <circuitbone>	It's your premise to qualify the answers. lol
Feb 20 22:40:22 <pekster>	If anyone who isn't here just to troll has a clue how to do this, I'd love answers. Otherwise I'll link a FB radar if people wish to pile-on and file their own who would find such a feature useful.
Feb 20 22:40:58 <circuitbone>	Projecting now?.
Feb 20 22:48:32 <pekster>	I presume that was another snide comment, but I'm not unmasking any more blocked out text from you for a while (comment back if you wish, but it's for the benefit of others, not me.) Now on point to my problem, there's https://github.com/lifepillar/CSVKeychain but.. not a good way to handle keychain passphrases (obviously.)
Feb 20 22:49:08 <pekster>	Solution linked from this discussion, although besides the link supplied above, there's unsuprisingly little else of value: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6770639?sortBy=best
Feb 20 22:49:57 <pekster>	Still, more of a crappy hack than a proper solution, moreso since the decryption passphrase at least as the demo script uses will be handled with very poor security (either on-disk or in memory which Apple's on UI at least takes steps to secure whereas AppleScript wouldn't.)
Feb 20 22:50:06 <circuitbone>	Please stop with the projecting. It's not very professional.
Feb 20 23:01:30 <pekster>	Oh, to add insult to the linked project's README (which to be fair, seems to target an older version of macOS) it is not possible to use the right-click "Copy <count> items" into a temp-keychain with a disposable password since wifi (aka 'AirPort network password') entries can't seem to be pasted.
Feb 20 23:03:36 <pekster>	The UX is fairly unhelpful when you attempt this, just reporting "An error has occurred. Unable to add an item to the current keychain. One or more parameters passed to a function were not valid." It's unclear what this GUI message is supposed to mean to users; I don't even know what "parameters" implies here (what parameters? To what underlying system/CLI call?)
Feb 20 23:17:04 <pekster>	Seems it's unexportable by design (except to iCloud.) Another suggestion this is intentional is: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/467087
Feb 20 23:42:43 <pekster>	Feedback filed, feel free to reference if you send in your own: FB13638258
Feb 20 23:43:41 <Brains>	For what issue?
Feb 20 23:44:41 <pekster>	Keychain Access.app's refusion to export (anything actually, but wifi entries that are ALREADY visible to the user if they check the 'show password' box) PLUS a most unhelpful error when copying (right-click copy) into a new keychain.
Feb 20 23:45:19 <Brains>	Ah. Yeah, that's a stupid oversight.
Feb 20 23:45:27 <pekster>	The latter was an attempt to use either the `security` CLI tool or some other mechanism to export the passwords. It looks a lot like Apple doesn't want you to leave their walled garden, but perhaps this is just an oversight and they really want to fix it with a clear demonstration of the problem.
Feb 20 23:45:50 <pekster>	Well, maybe it is, and maybe it's to encourage users to use iCloud for syncing and just buy Apple.
Feb 20 23:46:02 <Brains>	(d) all of the above
Feb 20 23:46:21 <pekster>	At any rate, *every* entry can't be exported, or at least I haven't found one that can. Even in test keychains that contain just silly entries (eg: a 'XKCD passphrase' entry of 'correcthorsebatterystaple')
Feb 20 23:46:35 <pekster>	Brains: Yes, (d) it is indeed: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/467087
Feb 20 23:47:06 <pekster>	So not only do I whine about it here, I file feedback so I can have Yet Another one that Apple will ignore. They didn't exactly have a Keychain category, so I picked 'Security' -- maybe that'll get it more attention?
Feb 20 23:47:14 <pekster>	(or just ignored faster, who can say.)
Feb 20 23:47:33 <Brains>	Keychain is part of Security so that works.
Feb 20 23:49:04 <Brains>	If you're not on the MacAdmins Slack already, you should be - that's exactly the kind of glitch that affects administrators, so sharing your FB there (in #apple-feedback) will let the rest of us pile on it. The more "me too"'s an FB gets, the faster it gets processed.
Feb 20 23:52:52 <pekster>	I mean, the moment they see this isn't iCloud enabled and the intention is to export in bulk to a non-iCloud-supporting device I presume this gets the lowest priority possible.
Feb 20 23:53:37 <pekster>	It really only even impacts admins if they're taking control of another user's machine and trying to export, say, all the wifi networks that user has connected to (or whatever else is in the 'Local Items' keychain.)
Feb 20 23:54:43 <pekster>	And sure, going through 100 or however many entries would suck, but https://xkcd.com/1205 explains I've already put in more time than I would have spent copying my 31 wifi networks by hand out of here (and shame on me for putting them into macOS directly instead of my password manager, which _does_ allow exports.)
Feb 20 23:55:44 <Brains>	Admins get really uppity when *any* of their CLI tools don't work as intended.
Feb 20 23:56:23 <Brains>	(They're going to be *seriously* pissed if/when FruitCo make the whole CLI thing optional again. Yes, they're still playing with that.)
Feb 20 23:56:43 <pekster>	I'm not sure `security` lets you dig into the 'Local Items' keychain actually, although the only even remotely on-point reference I found here was a really horrible script that leveraged the assistive technology, but it relied on the keychain password being hardcoded, so they suggested a temp-keychain.
Feb 20 23:57:16 <pekster>	Ironically that's what led me to the secondary error when copy/pasting wifi passwords out, which is apparently a cardinal sin under Apple's security design (but they'll show the plaintext password if you know the keychain passphrase, no problem!)
Feb 20 23:58:44 <pekster>	Not an FB, but the 'Me too' cound didn't help this poor user, 5 years ago: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250182520
Feb 20 23:59:41 <Brains>	Apple staff aren't allowed to visit let alone interact with anyone on discussions.apple any more. Been that way since Steve died.
Feb 20 23:59:50 <pekster>	Awesome.
Feb 21 00:00:01 <pekster>	Well, another mark for the 'this is probably done on purpose' column is: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keychain-access/kyca1121/mac
Feb 21 00:01:59 <pekster>	"Note: You can’t copy passwords stored in your Local Items or iCloud Keychain." <-- that's wrong. You can, if you're able to show the password for the entry (I don't know if all entries work that way, but wifi passwords do.) You just can't use the "copy item" context (or menu) item.

Feb 22 23:50:27 <BullHorn>	new apple watch arriving next week
Feb 22 23:50:57 <BullHorn>	i don't need one, my 8th gen is perfectly fine but i had to spend some recognition points at work and the watch seemed like the best option
Feb 22 23:51:14 <BullHorn>	think i'll sell my watch and use the newer one
Feb 22 23:51:30 <BullHorn>	new has 4g too so i'll probably get a data plan for it

Feb 23 15:01:31 <maccampus>	 My Mac went into recoverymode & i noticed zsh was changed to bash. is Bash still the standard sh in recovery mode ? Why ?
Feb 23 16:14:25 <dubiago>	is bash insufficient? personally, i can go between the two pretty easily.
Feb 23 16:27:35 <phigan>	bash rulz, zsh droolz.
Feb 23 16:28:24 <phigan>	it goes like tcsh > bash > zsh > csh > ksh > sh
Feb 23 16:28:43 <phigan>	in case you were wondering.
Feb 23 16:32:21 <maccampus>	no first was sh > csh (don't ever use this) > tcsh > ksh > bash > zsh > fish
Feb 23 16:33:27 <maccampus>	And early MacOSX used tcsh, 1°.3 up bash, somewhere near 10.13 switch to zsh
Feb 23 16:33:43 *	R2robot uses fish
Feb 23 16:34:24 <maccampus>	i added fish for R2robot
Feb 23 16:34:41 <R2robot>	＼(^o^)／
Feb 23 16:34:59 <maccampus>	and because it's one of the newest shells
Feb 23 16:36:12 <maccampus>	But i keep wondering why pple changes the shell to zsh in the normal OS but kept Bash in the Recovery OS
Feb 23 16:36:45 <maccampus>	Is  there a reason why Bash would function as a better shell in Recovery mode
Feb 23 16:37:41 <phigan>	I was listing in order of best to worst. In my statement, the > was used as "greater than"
Feb 23 16:38:24 <R2robot>	phigan: you think tcsh is best?
Feb 23 16:38:36 <phigan>	I'm guessing it's because the people in charge of recovery mode are not the same people in charge of the regular shell environment.
Feb 23 16:38:43 <maccampus>	csh should be unlisted or at the end then
Feb 23 16:38:54 <R2robot>	don't you have to remember to type rehash in tcsh so that you can see newly added commands?
Feb 23 16:39:00 <phigan>	R2robot: I have to admit, I haven't used it in years, but yeah it was my favorite over bash.
Feb 23 16:40:19 <R2robot>	phigan: I used it briefly during my emo/FreeBSD phase.   It was... not so great. lol
Feb 23 16:40:40 <maccampus>	my favorite shell was thecmd.exe from OS/2 :)
Feb 23 16:41:03 <phigan>	I liked some of the things it let me do at the time with C-like scripting.
Feb 23 16:41:12 <maccampus>	or the rc shell
Feb 23 16:41:15 <phigan>	eventually I didn't need those things anymore.
Feb 23 16:41:20 <R2robot>	ahh
Feb 23 16:41:31 <phigan>	and distros cut out tcsh from standard install
Feb 23 16:41:39 <phigan>	so i just went with the flow and used the default
Feb 23 16:42:07 <maccampus>	i guess because it should considered dangerouss s it is also a csh
Feb 23 18:12:17 <pekster>	csh (and derived shells) do everything so very wrong. Basic concepts that work in POSIX sh (yes, the most limiting Unix shell you'll find) like I/O redirection are just a mess in (t)csh.
Feb 23 18:12:58 <pekster>	Plenty of real-world examples that any competent shell scripter should readily understand: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot
Feb 23 21:12:52 <Brains>	Ahoy-hoy.

Feb 23 22:13:08 <BullHorn>	this mofo is hidden in the Share button
Feb 23 22:15:00 <BullHorn>	but of all the things im still steuggling in iphone, by far the worst are the keyboard (in general, almost everything about it) and the inability to
Feb 23 22:15:27 <BullHorn>	block non-number contacts (basically sms spam that cones from a name instead of a number)
Feb 23 22:16:07 <BullHorn>	tbh this dogshit keyboard alone is enough to make me want to return to android
Feb 23 22:16:25 <BullHorn>	but im kind kf stuck because i do like the apple watch and car play enough :/
Feb 23 22:18:04 <Brains>	*shrug* the last iOS I played with was v6. Never tried Android, but then I don't like smartphones.
Feb 23 22:18:05 <BullHorn>	they added 3rd party keyboards to the store, vut they work weird between different apps
Feb 24 02:34:11 <tony>	Apple doesn’t make its own Calculator app?
Feb 24 02:34:57 <Brains>	Not for the iPad, apparently.
Feb 24 02:35:44 <Brains>	I remember there being one on my iPhone 4s last time I played with it, but that was quite a while ago.
Feb 24 02:39:21 <TheAppleFox>	tony the iPad is the only platform that lacks a calculator
Feb 24 02:39:50 <TheAppleFox>	officially built by Apple, cause Steve Jobs saw it as entertainment device
Feb 24 02:44:05 <sem>	he had not heard of recreational maths, clearly
Feb 24 02:45:33 <zvijezda>	spotlight on ipad has a built in calculator
Feb 24 02:46:37 <zvijezda>	you can use a remote desktop app to use mathematica on the ipad
Feb 24 02:49:46 <Brains>	The Canadian version of 'OK': https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GHC1WH5XoAA4j82.jpg

Feb 24 03:15:48 <snappy>	i didn't understand the interactive part he made hand gestures, but i'm not sure if he's manipulating the visualisation
Feb 24 03:16:09 <snappy>	okay, i see it now
Feb 24 03:16:34 <Brains>	Yeah, halfway through.
Feb 24 03:16:59 <Brains>	Starts flicking pixie-dust trails around. Quite cool.
Feb 24 03:18:03 <evilscreww63>	does anyone here watch LR?
Feb 24 03:18:12 <evilscreww63>	is it just a matter of luck he has dozens of "doner boards"
Feb 24 03:18:31 <evilscreww63>	what do you do if you need a ferrite bead or cap or something and dont have doners
Feb 24 03:18:35 <snappy>	i mean he runs a repair shop, he'd have quite a bit of access to inventory

Feb 29 08:13:47 <BullHorn>	not only is it bad, manually correcting a mistake with it takes way too much effort too
Feb 29 08:14:11 <BullHorn>	like if you tap a word that requires correction, you wont get what you wanted
Feb 29 08:15:00 <BullHorn>	instead if it placing the cursor where you tapped, 33% of the time it will appear at yhe end if the sentence and 33% of the time it will highlight the word before or after the word you wanted
Feb 29 08:37:06 <jiggawatt>	BullHorn: your thumb sucks
Feb 29 08:37:13 <jiggawatt>	also, you can install alternative keyboards iirc
Feb 29 09:26:28 <BullHorn>	it doesnt work well on ios because it still overrides it and half the time it launches the default keyboard
Feb 29 09:26:36 <BullHorn>	or a variation if it, theres many
Feb 29 09:26:48 <BullHorn>	like simetimes the . is located between slacebar and enter
Feb 29 09:26:51 <BullHorn>	sometimes its not
