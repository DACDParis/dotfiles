janv. 18 07:26:22 <mdogg>	If you are using a box as a server then you should be booting to runlevel 3
janv. 18 07:26:46 <karthyk>	What difference does it make?
janv. 18 07:26:47 <mdogg>	ALWAYS disable hibernation.
janv. 18 07:26:57 <karthyk>	Ok
janv. 18 07:27:01 <mdogg>	Hibernation is crap.  This isn't 1996.
janv. 18 07:27:12 <karthyk>	It came on by default
janv. 18 07:27:19 <mdogg>	Well, make sure it never comes on.
janv. 18 07:27:22 <karthyk>	I never wanted to enable it
janv. 18 07:27:57 <karthyk>	I saw some forum post where you need to add a flag somewhere to fully disable hibernation
janv. 18 07:28:00 <mdogg>	I'm gonna go downstairs and watch a movie.  I'll talk to you guys later - cheers!
janv. 18 07:28:00 <karthyk>	On mint
janv. 18 07:28:12 <karthyk>	What movie
janv. 18 07:28:22 <karthyk>	Dean he left
janv. 18 07:28:25 <karthyk>	Damn
janv. 18 07:29:07 <mdogg>	XFCE has a way to disable it but in runlevel 3 with all Power Power Saving options disabled except for the screen, then it should be an issue.
janv. 18 07:29:56 <karthyk>	I fixed it I guess it’s not going down maybe 15mins is not up yet
janv. 18 07:29:58 <mdogg>	karthyk: Paste the output of 'lsblk --fs'
janv. 18 07:30:02 <mdogg>	To a pastebin.
janv. 18 07:30:17 <karthyk>	I thought you gonna watch a movie
janv. 18 07:30:24 <karthyk>	I will paste it wait
janv. 18 07:30:26 <mdogg>	Well, yeah.  Have a good night.
janv. 18 07:30:29 <mdogg>	Oh ok.
janv. 18 07:30:44 <karthyk>	I might dc 
janv. 18 07:30:47 <karthyk>	BRB
janv. 18 07:30:57 <mdogg>	Discontinue?
janv. 18 07:31:04 <mdogg>	Oh, disconnect.
janv. 18 07:31:31 <mdogg>	I'm not going to troubleshoot something via a 3rd party.  
janv. 18 07:31:46 <mdogg>	She needs to come back when she has real-time access to the box. 
janv. 18 07:32:35 <mdogg>	"Ok mdogg, I'm on the freeway right now so I'll try those commands and paste the output when I get back home." 
janv. 18 07:33:11 <karthyk>	https://ibb.co/4mg3X46
janv. 18 07:33:28 <karthyk>	I am on an iPad
janv. 18 07:33:50 <karthyk>	It’s hard to multitask man
janv. 18 07:34:36 <mdogg>	Your SWAP partition is 16GB?  It really doesn't need to be that large, but you can reduce it some other time I guess.  
janv. 18 07:35:13 <karthyk>	How did you know
janv. 18 07:35:17 <mdogg>	You have 8GB of RAM - I would probably make it 6GB-8GB at most.   
janv. 18 07:35:42 <mdogg>	It says it's 93% full with 15.3GB free.
janv. 18 07:35:43 <karthyk>	I read on arch wiki that I need twice the amount of ram as swap
janv. 18 07:35:57 <mdogg>	No, that's a very old outdated methodology.
janv. 18 07:36:30 <karthyk>	I will reduce it
janv. 18 07:36:31 <mdogg>	That would mean that someone with 128GB of RAM would need a 256GB SWAP partition.  That makes even less sense.
janv. 18 07:36:57 <karthyk>	I mean swap is used when ram runs out right
janv. 18 07:37:32 <mdogg>	Type 'free -g'  That will show you how your RAM/SWAP is currently used.
janv. 18 07:37:39 <mdogg>	I doubt you're using much.
janv. 18 07:38:31 <mdogg>	Maxtor - that's a 'blast from the past' manufacture.
janv. 18 07:38:37 <karthyk>	https://ibb.co/b2GntZr
janv. 18 07:39:13 <karthyk>	Yea it’s a old had I had laying around so I plugged it on why not
janv. 18 07:39:27 <mdogg>	That drive will slow everything down.
janv. 18 07:39:27 <karthyk>	Hdd*
janv. 18 07:39:35 <mdogg>	That's an old ATA disk.
janv. 18 07:39:47 <karthyk>	It’s not even plugged in lol
janv. 18 07:39:53 <karthyk>	I mean it’s plugged in
janv. 18 07:39:57 <karthyk>	Not mounted
janv. 18 07:40:19 <mdogg>	Where's /home?
janv. 18 07:40:24 <mdogg>	NAS?
janv. 18 07:40:32 <mdogg>	Well, no, it would still show up
janv. 18 07:40:35 <karthyk>	I don’t have separate partition
janv. 18 07:40:40 <karthyk>	All in root
janv. 18 07:40:52 <mdogg>	Oh - that's not a good idea.  If anything happens to root all your data is gone.
janv. 18 07:41:19 <mdogg>	But, you do what you want.  I'm just advising on best practices.
janv. 18 07:41:26 <AmyMalik>	Mreow?
janv. 18 07:41:29 <mdogg>	Anyway, time for me to zone out on the couch fo ra bit.
janv. 18 07:41:35 <karthyk>	I mean I can’t change it now can I
janv. 18 07:41:47 <AmyMalik>	karthyk, You can, if you copy the data onto a new drive and change it.
janv. 18 07:41:56 <karthyk>	That’s a lot of work
janv. 18 07:41:59 <AmyMalik>	It is
janv. 18 07:42:05 <AmyMalik>	But so is re-standing everything up after a drive failure
janv. 18 07:42:08 <karthyk>	Is it worth it tho
janv. 18 07:42:10 <mdogg>	Yeah, probably take less time to just wipe and reinstall.
janv. 18 07:42:27 <mdogg>	Anyway, l8
janv. 18 07:42:31 <AmyMalik>	You should have backups, and you should have separate partitions for things (if you aren't using ZFs like a weirdo)
janv. 18 07:42:38 <AmyMalik>	(I use ZFS 'cause I'm a weirdo)
janv. 18 07:43:01 <AmyMalik>	and you should also use RAID, which is not a backup (it only improves the reliability of the live data set)
janv. 18 07:43:10 <AmyMalik>	but I understand you probably aren't rich
janv. 18 07:43:13 <karthyk>	How can separate portion change stuff it’s all in the same drive anyway right
janv. 18 07:43:28 <karthyk>	If the hdd bites the dust all gone anyway
janv. 18 07:43:37 <mdogg>	karthyk: Just as a reference, this is my 'lsblk --fs' output --> https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/c0de41261581
janv. 18 07:44:08 <AmyMalik>	at least rotary drives are analogue devices at heart. if you corrupt one partition, the other might still be readable, but if everything's in one partition (which it also is if you use ZFS...) then if you corrupt that, you're gone
janv. 18 07:44:48 <AmyMalik>	SSDs are more of a digital device and while the same thing applies as rotaries with corrupting one partition, the ways you can do that without destroying the whole disk are more limited
janv. 18 07:44:52 <karthyk>	Will my hdd die
janv. 18 07:44:56 <AmyMalik>	ho old is it
janv. 18 07:44:58 <AmyMalik>	how*
janv. 18 07:44:59 <karthyk>	If I run it 24/7
janv. 18 07:45:07 <AmyMalik>	No, that's actually better for it than start-stop operation
janv. 18 07:45:17 <AmyMalik>	but it consumes more power
janv. 18 07:45:21 <AmyMalik>	and idk what india's power mix is like
janv. 18 07:45:36 <sittingduck>	Stick in a UPS in front of it.
janv. 18 07:45:40 <karthyk>	Power is not a problem but yea power is expensive but meh
janv. 18 07:46:01 <AmyMalik>	sittingduck, that won't help with the power mix
janv. 18 07:46:21 <AmyMalik>	start-stop operation can also be effected without having blackouts, by enabling power saving modes
janv. 18 07:46:41 <karthyk>	I disabled them all
janv. 18 07:46:54 <karthyk>	Pc don’t down
janv. 18 07:47:03 <karthyk>	Pc don’t go down
janv. 18 07:47:28 <AmyMalik>	okay
janv. 18 07:47:29 <karthyk>	mdogg: i like your portion layout.
janv. 18 07:47:36 <karthyk>	Partition
janv. 18 07:47:57 <AmyMalik>	karthyk, how's yours?
janv. 18 07:48:02 <AmyMalik>	do i need to scroll up again
janv. 18 07:48:08 <karthyk>	Mine is crap lol
janv. 18 07:48:14 <karthyk>	I posted a pic
janv. 18 07:48:23 <karthyk>	Let me find it
janv. 18 07:48:36 <dminuoso_>	07:43:01      AmyMalik │ and you should also use RAID, which is not a backup (it only improves the reliability of the live data set)
janv. 18 07:48:45 <AmyMalik>	ah
janv. 18 07:48:47 <AmyMalik>	i see
janv. 18 07:48:50 <karthyk>	https://ibb.co/4mg3X46
janv. 18 07:49:11 <AmyMalik>	why are you hammering at it on an ipad
janv. 18 07:49:12 <dminuoso_>	I've come to the conclusion, that calling something "not a backup" is usually some elaborate scheme as if "backup" has some clear definite meaning, which it does not.
janv. 18 07:49:14 <AmyMalik>	don't you have a laptop
janv. 18 07:49:21 <AmyMalik>	dminuoso_, well, yes
janv. 18 07:49:41 <dminuoso_>	A backup is, foremost, just a form of data duplication. The main question is just, what kind of data loss you want to protect yourself against.
janv. 18 07:49:41 <karthyk>	I am on my bed chilling AmyMalik
janv. 18 07:49:44 <AmyMalik>	technically, what is and is not a backup is not clearcut
janv. 18 07:49:51 <karthyk>	Laptop too big noisy hot 
janv. 18 07:50:16 <AmyMalik>	... ha. I use one of my four (count'm!) laptops in my bed. it's quite heavy though, probably bad for my wrist
janv. 18 07:50:38 <karthyk>	Where do you place the laptop
janv. 18 07:50:45 <karthyk>	On your lap?
janv. 18 07:52:00 <AmyMalik>	I hold it in my hand. It's a convertible tablet, with a swivelling screen
janv. 18 07:52:01 <dminuoso_>	AmyMalik: The important part really is the threat model here. Once you have established attack vectors and consider the data critical enough to protect, then data duplication is a mitigation strategy. How much separation (physical distance, logical, privilege wise) you need only depends on your mitigation goals.
janv. 18 07:52:09 <AmyMalik>	dminuoso_, yup.
janv. 18 07:52:24 <karthyk>	Throughput is like how much stuff can go through and bandwidth is how much is going through am I right
janv. 18 07:52:38 <dminuoso_>	So RAID0 can be just as valid as a backup as an AWS Glacier. It really depends.
janv. 18 07:52:44 <dminuoso_>	*RAID1 of course.
janv. 18 07:52:53 <karthyk>	But I am poor
janv. 18 07:52:57 <karthyk>	Can’t raid
janv. 18 07:52:58 <AmyMalik>	karthyk, I don't think those are set. What is the context?
janv. 18 07:53:13 <AmyMalik>	Can't raid my ass. How much do two 256gb SSDs cost you
janv. 18 07:53:42 <karthyk>	I’d rather buy I big as 7200rpm HDD
janv. 18 07:53:49 <AmyMalik>	SSDs are cheaper nowadays
janv. 18 07:54:10 <karthyk>	HDDs are even cheaper
janv. 18 07:54:40 <karthyk>	On my main pc I have a 2tb name drive though
janv. 18 07:54:47 <karthyk>	Nvme 
janv. 18 07:55:04 <karthyk>	Man this autocorrect feature is annoying 
janv. 18 07:56:12 <AmyMalik>	I think I've made a mistke
janv. 18 07:56:29 <AmyMalik>	amazon.in is a strange alternate universe
janv. 18 07:56:35 <karthyk>	Why lol
janv. 18 07:57:00 <AmyMalik>	there are SSD brands I have _never_ heard of (and obv wouldn't trust in your gateway machine)
janv. 18 07:57:19 <karthyk>	Why did you go to Amazon.in
janv. 18 07:57:35 <karthyk>	I am ashamed of my country
janv. 18 07:57:45 <mlu>	karthyk: why?
janv. 18 07:57:47 <AmyMalik>	Why are you ashamed of your country?
janv. 18 07:58:02 <AmyMalik>	Amazon is an American company; their India wing is no less American in reality
janv. 18 07:58:15 <karthyk>	Because we have all bad products all good products can only be bought from US
janv. 18 07:58:20 <mlu>	afaik, India has a lot of great food, has a lot of smart people and culture
janv. 18 07:58:43 <karthyk>	I Mean the e-commerce 
janv. 18 07:58:44 <mlu>	the population did result in some poverty, but that's no reason to be ashamed
janv. 18 07:59:21 <mlu>	karthyk: I've bought a lot of good steel products here -- they were made in India
janv. 18 07:59:31 <karthyk>	Oh nice
janv. 18 08:00:14 <karthyk>	Do you guys have mechanical keyboards or rubber dome
janv. 18 08:00:18 <AmyMalik>	Both
janv. 18 08:00:26 <AmyMalik>	My laptops are obviously all various R/D
janv. 18 08:00:32 <mlu>	karthyk: why not both? :D
janv. 18 08:00:42 <AmyMalik>	my desktop keyboard is a unicomp ultra classic, made in kentucky, last of its line
janv. 18 08:00:43 <karthyk>	I don’t like rubber dome
janv. 18 08:00:44 <mlu>	in fact, there are some parts of India I wish the US was more like
janv. 18 08:00:49 <AmyMalik>	well, not quite last of its line
janv. 18 08:00:56 <mlu>	for example, I heard the gender ratio is much more balanced in the tech fields
janv. 18 08:01:15 <karthyk>	Mm not really who told you that
janv. 18 08:01:48 <AmyMalik>	maybe the above board tech fields
janv. 18 08:02:20 <mlu>	this -^
janv. 18 08:02:27 <mlu>	you just take a look at the photo of teams, etc.
janv. 18 08:02:36 <mlu>	the male/female ratio is closer to 2:1 instead of 10:1
janv. 18 08:04:11 <karthyk>	Ok back to topic how much processing power do I need for a load balancer can I get a edge router 4
janv. 18 08:04:25 <karthyk>	300 users 500mbps internet
janv. 18 08:05:31 <Blondie101010>	will they be downloading big files or watching any videos?
janv. 18 08:06:21 <mlu>	karthyk: it depends
janv. 18 08:06:25 <mlu>	karthyk: what type of load balancing?
janv. 18 08:06:49 <karthyk>	I have 2 isp I need to do failover and load balancing 
janv. 18 08:06:55 <mlu>	karthyk: I've only tested up to 40 users (with 150 devices) -- handled a gig just fine
janv. 18 08:07:11 <karthyk>	300 is too much I guess
janv. 18 08:07:56 <mlu>	karthyk: wait, you're gonna have mulitple upstream providers, right?
janv. 18 08:08:02 <mlu>	karthyk: the ER4 doesn't do SD-WAN well
janv. 18 08:08:18 <mlu>	karthyk: and you can have multiple upstream providers, but the amount of RAM is too limited
janv. 18 08:08:33 <mlu>	i.e. you should have at least 8GB for a full edge BGP table
janv. 18 08:08:54 <karthyk>	The thing is people are Afraid of opnsense and they don’t want to use it cuz they think it’s hard to maintain and use what is SD-WAN
janv. 18 08:09:11 <mlu>	karthyk: if you don't know what SD-WAN is, don't worry about it
janv. 18 08:09:28 <mlu>	but it's usually what you talk about when you want load balancing across multiple internet connections without BGP
janv. 18 08:09:29 *	karthyk googles SD-WAN
janv. 18 08:10:02 <Blondie101010>	$projectDuration += 6months
janv. 18 08:10:03 <mlu>	and yeah, better to use a specific router OS if one exists
janv. 18 08:10:17 <mlu>	in short, please don't do SD-WAN
janv. 18 08:10:36 <AmyMalik>	karthyk, that sounds like just a failover question
janv. 18 08:10:46 <mlu>	and if you don't have your own ASN, plase don't do load balancing
janv. 18 08:10:57 <mlu>	do just failover
janv. 18 08:11:11 <Blondie101010>	they only mean to balance outbound connections between the two links
janv. 18 08:11:15 <AmyMalik>	if you do load balancing without your own AS, you need to be abnormally smart about it or you could just break evverything
janv. 18 08:11:26 <mlu>	this -^
janv. 18 08:11:26 <Blondie101010>	if you use sticky connections, it can be fairly balanced
janv. 18 08:11:38 <AmyMalik>	that kind of abnormal smarts is ... not common in the junior netw eng.
janv. 18 08:11:50 <mlu>	now imagine one of your clients tries to intiiate a passive FTP connection :P
janv. 18 08:11:59 <mlu>	that's where things break
janv. 18 08:12:26 <karthyk>	Sorry about that my iPad took a dump on me
janv. 18 08:12:27 <mlu>	karthyk: now imagine one of your clients tries to intiiate a passive FTP connection :P
janv. 18 08:12:40 <mlu>	karthyk: and yeah, just don't load balance if you aren't big enough to have your own ASN
janv. 18 08:12:47 <mlu>	because it's exceptionally tricky and tacky
janv. 18 08:13:03 <Blondie101010>	not that bad
janv. 18 08:13:10 <mlu>	but yeah ER-4 is sufficient for 300 users + mulitple upsterams /w failover
janv. 18 08:13:37 *	mlu remembers that lady he worked with that could never get a VPN connection working at home
janv. 18 08:13:50 <karthyk>	Basically I have 2 isp and 2 core routers doing vrrp I will put the load balancer before the routers
janv. 18 08:14:26 <mlu>	both she and her husband worked in IT and setup some convoluted SD-WAN system at home, adn the result of that ended up being that only the wireguard VPN worked reliably for her
janv. 18 08:14:51 <mlu>	karthyk: do those two core routers route the same IP block?
janv. 18 08:15:06 <mlu>	karthyk: if so, then the EdgeRotuer 4 will be fine
janv. 18 08:15:13 <mlu>	you'd just do ECMP for the upstream
janv. 18 08:15:29 <AmyMalik>	oh no
janv. 18 08:15:32 <Blondie101010>	mlu:  2 regular Internet connections
janv. 18 08:15:40 <Blondie101010>	with different providers
janv. 18 08:15:49 <AmyMalik>	likely karthy is getting CG-NAT
janv. 18 08:15:54 <AmyMalik>	from two different ISPs
janv. 18 08:15:59 <Blondie101010>	:)
janv. 18 08:16:06 <Blondie101010>	but wouldn't matter much
janv. 18 08:16:10 <mlu>	if that's the case, yeah, just do failover, not load balancing
janv. 18 08:16:10 <Blondie101010>	only outbound
janv. 18 08:16:36 <mlu>	or I'd just assign half the users one gateway and the other half the other
janv. 18 08:16:39 <Blondie101010>	failover is easier but not that hard to balance to waste less
janv. 18 08:16:42 <AmyMalik>	I'd suggest failover only, and having your main router act also as failover (at that scale it is not a major load on the system)
janv. 18 08:16:58 <AmyMalik>	of course I am bad at network design
janv. 18 08:17:14 <Blondie101010>	splitting the configs in 2 does make sense
janv. 18 08:17:37 <karthyk>	https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10colJtpP4AsTyZP8NojAiBoYZ2XclPcl/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105226802836678546335&rtpof=true&sd=true 
janv. 18 08:18:22 <karthyk>	Check out the maximum sheet
janv. 18 08:18:27 <karthyk>	That’s what we are getting
janv. 18 08:18:50 <karthyk>	For 300 users and 500mbps and 300 mbps backup
janv. 18 08:19:06 <mlu>	27 lakh rupee! WOA
janv. 18 08:19:19 <karthyk>	That’s minimum
janv. 18 08:19:27 <karthyk>	Look at maximum
janv. 18 08:19:36 <karthyk>	There are two sheets
janv. 18 08:20:51 <Blondie101010>	still see some 2TB storate that will likely be the slowest NAS in the world
janv. 18 08:21:01 <Blondie101010>	*storage
janv. 18 08:21:23 <mlu>	karthyk: kind annoyed that DLink is speced for the unmanaged switches even though they're fine :)
janv. 18 08:21:31 <dminuoso_>	If you want slow, look no further than tape drives.
janv. 18 08:22:02 <Blondie101010>	the actual drive speed won't be the issue, concurrency will
janv. 18 08:22:27 <karthyk>	Mlu basically the engineer told me access layer routers can be dirt cheap it’s fine
janv. 18 08:22:29 <dminuoso_>	Im stipulating average usage with more than just one concurrent disk command.
janv. 18 08:22:34 <karthyk>	So I was like ok
janv. 18 08:22:36 <mlu>	karthyk: it is :)
janv. 18 08:22:54 <mlu>	they're actually all the same, but DLink tends to be an annoying vendor
janv. 18 08:23:01 <karthyk>	Why tho
janv. 18 08:23:06 *	mlu prefesr TPLink or Netgear, but DLink is fine for the unamanged stuff
janv. 18 08:23:21 <karthyk>	Bad support? Bad firmware?
janv. 18 08:23:29 <mlu>	they tend to cheap out big time (DLink) and sell junk
janv. 18 08:23:42 <mlu>	you might end up with a batch where the power supplies they ship with the switches tend up not being stable
janv. 18 08:23:42 <karthyk>	I’ll remember that
janv. 18 08:23:50 <mlu>	(no rpboelm y,ou buy some new 12V power supplies and move on)
janv. 18 08:23:59 <karthyk>	Lol
janv. 18 08:24:42 <karthyk>	If I were to do fiber would the costs go up

janv. 18 08:26:31 *	Topic for #networking set by Allie!sid292248@libera/staff/allie (Sun Jan 14 11:49:30 2024)
janv. 18 08:26:47 <mlu>	for me, it's basically: does it ship in a reasonable physical form factor? did they include a good enough power supply (and if not, will I want to something else?)
janv. 18 08:27:05 <mlu>	I'd just rip off the reference design :)
janv. 18 08:27:43 <mlu>	it's literally just a single ASIC with a few PHYs attached
janv. 18 08:27:56 <karthyk>	mlu: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QKCc12F1GYqD2Srn9s5HcqRnB01FH_pF/view?usp=sharing
janv. 18 08:28:01 <karthyk>	Office
janv. 18 08:28:42 <dminuoso_>	Wouldnt be surprised if most of the vendors that primarily focus on unmanaged switches end up buying the same switching chips from some manufacturer and dont even design them themselves.
janv. 18 08:28:43 <mlu>	karthyk: wait, why is everything in ft? is your client in the US?
janv. 18 08:28:57 <karthyk>	I am in India
janv. 18 08:29:10 <karthyk>	We do ft
janv. 18 08:29:23 <mlu>	dminuoso_: I actually took apart a lot of those switches -- it's usually the Realtek or Mediatek chip
janv. 18 08:29:31 <grawity>	mlu: I like TL-SG108E because it's got at least a basic web-management UI, doesn't cost much more
janv. 18 08:29:37 <mlu>	whateveri s cheapest on lcsc.com at the moment
janv. 18 08:29:46 <mlu>	grawity: that's a risk if you aren't gonna use it :P
janv. 18 08:29:55 <dminuoso_>	mlu: Yeah makes perfect sense.
janv. 18 08:30:13 <mlu>	I like the GS108 beacuse the grey metal is sleek
janv. 18 08:30:21 <mlu>	and it can survive being run over by a car
janv. 18 08:30:25 <mlu>	(kinda)
janv. 18 08:30:56 <mlu>	now, for how cheap they are, if they've been run over by a car, defintiely just get a new one :)
janv. 18 08:30:58 <karthyk>	It’s not like your gonna play football with it
janv. 18 08:31:07 <mlu>	actually, why not?
janv. 18 08:31:10 <karthyk>	Lol
janv. 18 08:31:21 <mlu>	oh yeah, it's made of metal, might hurt the dog
janv. 18 08:31:44 <mlu>	karthyk: very surprised you use ft instead of meters in India
janv. 18 08:31:58 <karthyk>	Well now you know
janv. 18 08:32:30 <mlu>	karthyk: yeah, no need for fiber -- the office isn't big enough to justify
janv. 18 08:32:46 <mlu>	karthyk: wait, is this just your company, or is this all of India?
janv. 18 08:32:55 <mlu>	feels like they're trying too hard to be American in that acse
janv. 18 08:33:10 <mlu>	like, can you buy a 2x4 in India?
janv. 18 08:33:13 <karthyk>	It’s my company
janv. 18 08:33:41 <mlu>	karthyk: at least you print on A4 paper, right?
janv. 18 08:33:46 <karthyk>	Yes
janv. 18 08:33:53 <mlu>	phew :)
janv. 18 08:34:03 <dminuoso_>	I mean from a business perspective, because the chips are so relatively easy to design there's stiff competition that drove prices down a lot. Realtek and mediatek are established companies in networking chips, they provide documentation, drivers. Its hard to justify making your own chip unless you want it reconfigurable with more than just VLANs.
janv. 18 08:34:25 <mlu>	karthyk: the thing with fiber is that you'll need fiber techs to isntall them, and there's no power over ethernet support
janv. 18 08:34:31 <dminuoso_>	Its why companies rarely make their own USB cables. :)
janv. 18 08:34:36 <mlu>	karthyk: however, when it's >100m, fiber becomes quite useful
janv. 18 08:34:42 <dminuoso_>	Or, more appropriately for this channel, make their own patch cables.
janv. 18 08:34:57 <mlu>	and in practice, those Realtek and Mediatek chips work extremely well
janv. 18 08:35:32 <Affliction>	"Its why companies rarely make their own USB cables." Probably still end up working better than some of the crap out there
janv. 18 08:36:17 <dminuoso_>	Affliction: Well, if you have issues with your USB cables, then you're probably buying from the wrong vendor.
janv. 18 08:36:26 <mlu>	hehe
janv. 18 08:36:53 <Affliction>	Yeah, I've found a reliably decent supplier. But then, I'm not the only one getting cables.
janv. 18 08:37:05 <dminuoso_>	Its easy enough that anyone could make them, but the stiff competition makes it hard to make *functional* cables at lower prices than established vendors.
janv. 18 08:37:09 <mlu>	karthyk: does the company have any plans to upgrade any backhaul to 10G or faster anytime soon?
janv. 18 08:37:42 <mlu>	only reason that I make my own cables is becasue I can have them in any length I want, now
janv. 18 08:37:44 <karthyk>	Not really
janv. 18 08:37:54 <mlu>	I just have a big spool
janv. 18 08:37:57 <karthyk>	Maybe in 3 years
janv. 18 08:38:01 <Affliction>	I have, in a moment of desperation, turned a DE9 cable into a rollover cable. On more than 1 occasion.
janv. 18 08:38:01 <mlu>	that's soo enough
janv. 18 08:38:11 <mlu>	karthyk: best practice is to assume the cabling will last 20yr
janv. 18 08:38:17 <Affliction>	But yeah, buy most of the boring ol' cat6a
janv. 18 08:38:23 <dminuoso_>	08:09:11          +mlu │ karthyk: if you don't know what SD-WAN is, don't worry about it
janv. 18 08:38:23 <dminuoso_>	Nobody knows what SD-WAN is.
janv. 18 08:38:28 <mlu>	karthyk: but at those lengths, even 10G isn't a problem
janv. 18 08:38:52 <mlu>	SD-WAN is like "cloud"
janv. 18 08:38:56 <mlu>	fuzzy marketing term
janv. 18 08:39:23 <karthyk>	Is it possible to run load balancer in fail safe mode
janv. 18 08:39:26 <Affliction>	SD-WAN: Because good luck affording a /24 to do BGP
janv. 18 08:39:26 <mlu>	but hey, karthyk's specs did mention SD-WAN
janv. 18 08:39:37 <karthyk>	It does
janv. 18 08:40:03 <mlu>	karthyk: if I Was doing this build, I'd just handle all the routing on those
janv. 18 08:40:27 <mlu>	no reason to add some ER4s beforehand MIO
janv. 18 08:41:04 <karthyk>	I told my engineer to get 2 CCR2216 3 managed switches and like 37 unmanaged switches we need the transceivers too
janv. 18 08:41:08 <dminuoso_>	Affliction: No no no. You dont put SD-WAN and specific protocols or technologies in one sentence
janv. 18 08:41:13 <dminuoso_>	Use only nebulous marketing terms.
janv. 18 08:41:16 <dminuoso_>	Like horizontal scale
janv. 18 08:41:28 <karthyk>	I didn’t prepare the chart
janv. 18 08:41:40 <Affliction>	I wonder if I could buy a couple thousand SDIO Wi-Fi cards, append a 0 to the price, and sell it as SD-LAN :)
janv. 18 08:41:45 <dminuoso_>	Next generation networks, AI-powered, software defined, highly resilient.
janv. 18 08:42:03 <dminuoso_>	Stuff that you could label your dog with, and still sell it.
janv. 18 08:42:13 <Affliction>	AI powered, right, so I have do do a few hundred billion floating point dot products to figure out where each packet's going, sounds efficient
janv. 18 08:42:45 <dminuoso_>	Affliction: Look, neural networks have inputs and outputs. Routing table lookup has inputs and outputs. Its trained too with BGP.
janv. 18 08:42:58 <dminuoso_>	Cant we just agree to call a routing engine a "neural engine" and make it AI powered?
janv. 18 08:43:16 <karthyk>	How are you gonna train it
janv. 18 08:43:21 <dminuoso_>	Look, that doesnt matter!
janv. 18 08:43:25 <Affliction>	neural net, IP net, same thing :)
janv. 18 08:43:26 <karthyk>	It does
janv. 18 08:43:32 <dminuoso_>	What matters is that its smart and increases your business potential
janv. 18 08:43:57 <mlu>	Affliction: nobody says you couldn't :P
janv. 18 08:44:10 <mlu>	Affliction: but you shouldn't because you'll die on the inside -- it's not worth it
janv. 18 08:44:23 <Affliction>	Yeah, that's the downside
janv. 18 08:44:30 <dminuoso_>	Maybe we can infuse ChatGPT to the command prompt, so you can just describe something like "I have a host connected to port A. Please configure it to have internet and make it extra secure"
janv. 18 08:44:34 <mlu>	leave it to those who have never lived in the inside
janv. 18 08:44:37 <dminuoso_>	Think that might drive sales?
janv. 18 08:45:26 <mlu>	hmm
janv. 18 08:45:34 <Affliction>	"Well, the internet is inherently insecure, shutting down port A"
janv. 18 08:46:35 <Affliction>	Perhaps use the older GPT-2 model where it'd emit paragraphs of stuff vaguely related to networks, that rapidly devolves into nonsense.
janv. 18 08:47:02 <Affliction>	Then pipe that through GPT-4T which translates that nonsense into commands for the hardware :D
janv. 18 08:47:26 <Affliction>	More AI is better, right?
janv. 18 08:47:38 <mlu>	ayeayeaye!

févr. 12 13:30:02 <neiluj>	hi! do you know a good tutorial to deploy some servers on GCP?
févr. 12 13:32:43 <pounce>	hi folks, i am having a big problem with POE. I have two devices, one that provides POE (ubiquiti UDM) and another that can be powered by POE (Ubiquiti USW flex mini switch) but the latter won't turn on at all when they are connected
févr. 12 13:32:51 <pounce>	i've tried a variety of cables
févr. 12 13:38:33 <rustyaxe>	check the configuration on supplying device's port. maybe poe is turned off
févr. 12 13:38:52 <pounce>	it says turned on
févr. 12 13:39:03 <pounce>	for that port (I've also tried the other POE port)
févr. 12 13:39:06 <djph>	are you supplying the "correct" poe?
févr. 12 13:39:24 <pounce>	djph: i have no idea, which is why i am here :D
févr. 12 13:41:11 <pounce>	is there any way to test (e.g. with a multimeter)?
févr. 12 13:45:46 <mlu>	neiluj: now why would you want to do that?
févr. 12 13:45:58 <mlu>	neiluj: are you really gonna trust your infrastructure to Google?
févr. 12 13:46:20 <neiluj>	yep! it's for testing a mockup of a design
févr. 12 13:46:22 <mlu>	pounce: what type of PSE and what PD?
févr. 12 13:46:32 <mlu>	neiluj: oh, ok -- and you happened to have google credits?
févr. 12 13:46:38 <mlu>	neiluj: t he docs should be decent enough
févr. 12 13:46:43 <neiluj>	hehe yes! lucky
févr. 12 13:47:02 <pounce>	mlu: UniFi Dream Router is the source
févr. 12 13:47:18 <neiluj>	ok! I was thinking if I'd need to learn terraform or just come up with a docker
févr. 12 13:47:27 <mlu>	neiluj: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs :)
févr. 12 13:47:29 <neiluj>	thanks!
févr. 12 13:47:29 <pounce>	PD is USW Flex Mini
févr. 12 13:48:02 <mlu>	neiluj: you only need terraform if you wanna automate several servers, and docker runs inside an instance :)
févr. 12 13:48:14 <mlu>	neiluj: both intorduce complexities you shouldn't worry about for now
févr. 12 13:48:53 <mlu>	pounce: USW Flex Mini is powered specifically on the PD port?
févr. 12 13:49:27 <pounce>	mlu: yeah I have the ethernet cable between the labeled PoE ports
févr. 12 13:50:52 <mlu>	pounce: it's odd that the UniFi Dream Router doesn't specify a PoE type
févr. 12 13:50:53 <pounce>	the switch says that it has a wattage of around 2.2W which should be easily provided by the router

févr. 12 14:01:25 <mlu>	pounce: but yeah, it seems like the UDR isn't standard PoE
févr. 12 14:03:48 <pounce>	ughhhh
févr. 12 14:03:58 <pounce>	so this means i need a passive -> active PoE adapter??
févr. 12 14:05:08 <mlu>	pounce: yeah
févr. 12 14:05:20 <mlu>	pounce: which are rare, or something like this: https://store.ui.com/us/en/collections/uisp-accessory-tech-poe-surge-converters/products/instant-802-3af-to-usb-adaptor
févr. 12 14:05:33 <pounce>	yeah i fonud one
févr. 12 14:06:06 <pounce>	too bad that i live in a country that's impossible to ship to
févr. 12 14:07:53 <mlu>	pounce: how badly do you need the features of the smart switch?
févr. 12 14:08:02 <pounce>	mlu: well, i need a switch
févr. 12 14:08:07 <mlu>	pounce: maybe you can find a switch that works on 48V passive PoE?
févr. 12 14:08:25 <pounce>	erm, again, country with very high tarrifs, electronics upcharges
févr. 12 14:08:32 <pounce>	so i should use the switch that i have
févr. 12 14:08:42 <pounce>	i might just have to plug it into the wall
févr. 12 14:09:11 <mlu>	hmm, Brazil?
févr. 12 14:09:18 <pounce>	Iceland :D
févr. 12 14:09:31 <mlu>	woah, didn't expect Iceland on that list
févr. 12 14:09:43 <pounce>	it costs a lot to get stuff from europe/UK, surprisingly
févr. 12 14:10:24 <mlu>	or hmm, I"d probably just use a proper unamanged PoE switch near the router
févr. 12 14:11:24 <pounce>	i wonder what sort of passive PoE/USB adapters exist
févr. 12 14:11:34 <pounce>	splitter*
févr. 12 14:18:52 <pounce>	mlu: everything i'm reading says that UDR does negotiation, it just doesn't support PoE+
févr. 12 14:19:38 <pounce>	im going to file a support ticket
févr. 12 14:20:10 <pounce>	but just for a quick sanity check: the cable doesn't have to be CAT6 or anything, right? it just has to have the right number of pins
févr. 12 14:20:51 <sittingduck>	And thick enough for PoE.
févr. 12 14:21:03 <sittingduck>	Else stuff will fry.
févr. 12 14:21:24 <pounce>	but then the cable would be damaged, and wouldn't work, right?
févr. 12 14:21:28 <pounce>	or does it measure resistance
févr. 12 14:21:50 <pounce>	i tried a real short cable (~5cm) which should have minimal resistance 
févr. 12 14:22:20 <sittingduck>	A bad cable will have high resistance.
févr. 12 14:22:43 <pounce>	wikipedia says 20Olm maximum, which is already required for CAT3
févr. 12 14:22:48 <pounce>	but i can double check with my multimeter
févr. 12 14:22:49 <sittingduck>	Fuck wikipedia.
févr. 12 14:22:53 <pounce>	:|
févr. 12 14:23:08 <sittingduck>	That thing is a disaster.
févr. 12 14:23:46 <sittingduck>	Don't compromise on the quality of your cable when it comes to PoE.
févr. 12 14:24:00 <pounce>	no of course, but i tried the highest quality cables that i have
févr. 12 14:24:09 <pounce>	and i've tried a lot of different ones
févr. 12 14:24:35 <sittingduck>	What's your original question?
févr. 12 14:25:09 <epony>	impedance calculation of power loss on cable length, obviously ;-)
févr. 12 14:25:16 <pounce>	:p
févr. 12 14:25:28 <pounce>	I'm trying to power a USW Flex Mini from a UDR over PoE and it ain't workin
févr. 12 14:28:35 <rustyaxe>	did you try powering it near each other with a known good patch able
févr. 12 14:28:36 <rustyaxe>	cable
févr. 12 14:28:55 <pounce>	near eachother, as in with a short cable?
févr. 12 14:29:05 <pounce>	yeah i used a known good short cable and it didn't work
févr. 12 14:29:21 <pounce>	they can communicate when the switch is externally powered but the switch doesn't start over PoE
févr. 12 14:29:42 <rustyaxe>	yea sounds like someones not trying to negotiate power as it should ;(
févr. 12 14:29:53 <pounce>	yeah :(
févr. 12 14:54:38 <hjf>	should i run fiber to my workstation, or just 6A (for 10gbe) ?
févr. 12 14:55:33 <hjf>	it's around 20M of wire from the switch to this computer. so i'm wondering if future-proofing with fiber is worth it
févr. 12 14:56:12 <mercenary>	why not both
févr. 12 14:58:10 <hjf>	there's currently a 5e and a 6 wire in there
févr. 12 14:58:18 <hjf>	i could replace the 5e with fiber maybe
févr. 12 14:59:29 <Allie>	i usually prefer fibre for 10G, but i'll take copper over multimode in some cases
févr. 12 14:59:43 <hjf>	20m multimode should be fine though no?
févr. 12 14:59:44 <Allie>	SMF > copper 10G > MMF
févr. 12 15:00:19 <Allie>	20M cat5e will happily carry gig if it's shielded, although it's not recommended :D
févr. 12 15:00:28 <Allie>	try to avoid new MMF in 2023
févr. 12 15:00:30 <Allie>	...4
févr. 12 15:00:46 <hjf>	which one is the aqua sheathed one?
févr. 12 15:00:49 <djph>	Allie: hell, 100m cat5e will happily carry gige
févr. 12 15:01:19 <Allie>	10G, eveb
févr. 12 15:01:38 <Allie>	i've done cat5e crimes plenty
févr. 12 15:01:41 <hjf>	are couplers ok for 10g on fiber?
févr. 12 15:02:17 <hjf>	want to leave a nice keystone instead of hanging cable
févr. 12 15:03:12 <hjf>	also on the other end i really need to fix the wiring. it's all cat5 and 6 terminated in plugs straight to the switch
févr. 12 15:03:30 <hjf>	i really need a patch panel there
févr. 12 15:09:12 <djph>	Allie: yes, but you know what you're doing.
févr. 12 15:24:22 <nb-ben>	I've got a GPON SFP module (nokia G-010S-A), I want  it to connect to my ISP at 2.5G, but it only links at 1gbit/s. The module supports 2.5gbps, and my service package with the ISP is for 2.5gbps. I've connected to the SFP module via SSH and set sgmii_mode to 5 (enabling 2.5gbps auto-negotiation). I'm using a mikrotik RB5009UPr+S+, I've set "Advertise" to "2.5G full". I just want to make sure there's 
févr. 12 15:24:28 <nb-ben>	not much else for me to do before I contact the ISP
févr. 12 15:24:38 <nb-ben>	is there anything else I could try or configure that I'm missing?
févr. 12 15:26:41 <neiluj>	hmm cannot connect to the server on GCP (HTTP error 111 connectiobn refused), even if the ports are open
févr. 12 15:27:47 <Blondie101010>	nb-ben:  doesn't the ISP provide your PON?
févr. 12 15:28:24 <nb-ben>	Blondie101010: they provide a router that I can't log in to, they control it remotely. I bought this SFP module from them to connect my own equipment
févr. 12 15:28:54 <neiluj>	(os error, not http error)
févr. 12 15:28:55 <Cowclops>	oh i saw a video about those 
févr. 12 15:29:02 <Cowclops>	the SFP module actually has its own little OS running on it
févr. 12 15:29:07 <Cowclops>	and a hard coded identifier
févr. 12 15:29:18 <nb-ben>	Cowclops: yep
févr. 12 15:29:39 <Cowclops>	can't just use a random gpon adapter or whatever
févr. 12 15:30:11 <nb-ben>	Cowclops: the link is up, I activated it with my ISP (gave them the module's SN)
févr. 12 15:30:30 <cousin_luigi>	https://hack-gpon.org/ ?
févr. 12 15:30:42 <nb-ben>	it took like 30 minutes for her to finally get someone who knew what a transciever is to input the S/N for it lol
févr. 12 15:30:57 <nb-ben>	her = tech support rep
févr. 12 15:31:56 <Cowclops>	i just read more of the back scroll and the product sheet for that sfp adapter, interesting that it DOES support 2.5 gig
févr. 12 15:32:00 <cousin_luigi>	If your ISP allows that, lucky you!
févr. 12 15:32:11 <Cowclops>	though the multigig RJ45 sfp+ adapters i've seen link at 10 gig then just... transmit at 2.5
févr. 12 15:32:24 <Cowclops>	intermediate speeds on SFP ports is a bit of a mystery to me
févr. 12 15:32:56 <Cowclops>	like my mikrotik worked and did the same thing in both the mikrotik switch and the unifi switch... switch said "10 gig" and my pc's nic said 5 gig. i only got like 3 gbps throughput but that could be caused by any number of things
févr. 12 15:33:05 <Cowclops>	crappy aquantia nic drivers for example
févr. 12 15:34:05 <nb-ben>	well, if there's more bandwidth on the table, I want it lol
févr. 12 15:34:12 <nb-ben>	even if it's not the full 2.5 :p
févr. 12 15:34:59 <nb-ben>	the primary reason for 2.5gig is because they then allow 250mbit/s upload, otherwise for 1gbps they only allow 100mbit/s
févr. 12 15:35:53 <Cowclops>	Interesting, because the upload for gpon is 1.25gbps regardless
févr. 12 15:36:06 <Cowclops>	changing the link speed wouldn't change how much upload bandwidth is shared among clients (meaningfully)
févr. 12 15:36:23 <nb-ben>	I think they limit it via QoS at some point
févr. 12 15:53:50 <Haxxa>	Any Public logging of this channel, I want to review some help  I got last week.
févr. 12 15:54:03 <Haxxa>	Forgot to save it down

Feb 20 15:36:50 <Thuryn>	eirirs, the Palo Alto is more likely to generate SFlow data and have a high degree of flexibility and detail in the data, if you're just interested in flows across the PA.

Feb 20 15:38:13 <Thuryn>	eirirs, on the other hand, if you want generic L2/L3/L4 data and you want it for ALL VMs (not just the Palo Alto), then it may make sense to do it in the vswitch.
Feb 20 15:38:57 <Thuryn>	That's assuming that there aren't any issues with the additional processing power and other resources necessary to generate that data, either in the PA VM or at the ESX host level.  NetFlow/SFlow/IPFIX/etc. can be very resource-intensive.
Feb 20 15:41:58 <whomp>	hi, i'm on a mac and i ssh into an ubuntu machine in the same internal network. however, there's a very noticeable lag between each keystroke and when it shows up in the ssh terminal, even though the latency should be tiny. any ideas how to fix this? i've tried mosh, but it hasn't helped
Feb 20 15:43:20 <sittingduck>	whomp: "even though the latency should be tiny". "should be" != "actually is". What is your ping latency in ms? 
Feb 20 15:48:43 <Blondie101010>	yeah it sounds like latency is guessed instead of checked
Feb 20 15:49:11 <Blondie101010>	but note that ssh lag could also be due to server resources, so watch top!
Feb 20 15:49:34 <whomp>	sittingduck , appears to be ~100ms, so i guess not great
Feb 20 15:50:13 <Blondie101010>	whomp:  so find out what creates such latency...  is it wifi?  is there a lot of bandwidth usage?
Feb 20 15:50:14 <sittingduck>	whomp: run a traceroute to your SSH server. 
Feb 20 15:53:44 <whomp>	sittingduck, it only indicates 1 5ms hop. but you can also see the high (and highly variable) ping times: https://pastecode.io/s/ig7uq719
Feb 20 15:54:23 <whomp>	and then suddenly the ping has gotten lower... not sure why
Feb 20 15:54:47 <sittingduck>	whomp: are you connected over wire or wifi? 
Feb 20 15:55:02 <whomp>	my mac is on wifi, my linux machine is on ethernet
Feb 20 15:55:13 <Blondie101010>	so rule out wifi
Feb 20 15:55:30 <Blondie101010>	it's normal for wifi to have higher latency
Feb 20 15:55:32 <sittingduck>	Right. Do you have a USB-to-Ethernet adapter? 
Feb 20 15:55:59 <sittingduck>	If you do, use that and recheck your ping and then your SSH connection.
Feb 20 15:57:02 <Blondie101010>	and don't check one after the other...  watch latency changes *while* having issues
Feb 20 15:57:08 <Blondie101010>	I use mtr for that
Feb 20 16:01:20 <javi404>	Whoop: do you control this network?
Feb 20 16:01:44 <javi404>	are you in a busy wifi urban area? any overlapping channels?
Feb 20 16:02:28 <javi404>	I meant that for whomp
Feb 20 16:13:58 <whomp>	sittingduck Blondie101010 i've now connected the mac to ethernet, so they're both on ethernet. while running the ping, i saw an odd spike at one point, where pings were ranging from 5-300ms, although right now it's settled down
Feb 20 16:25:41 <jerware>	Hi
Feb 20 16:32:02 <whomp>	sittingduck Blondie101010 is there any way to reduce lag when i'm just on wifi though?
Feb 20 16:32:33 <sittingduck>	whomp: try changing wifi channels. (After monitoring them for congestion).
Feb 20 16:33:28 <whomp>	k ty
Feb 20 16:34:08 <sittingduck>	whomp: on an android phone you can use a tool like "Wifi analyzer" that shows all the APs on various channels. 
Feb 20 16:35:04 <whomp>	cool
Feb 20 16:44:38 <tomman>	another vote for WiFi Analyzer (plus it's FOSS and it's available on F-Droid)
Feb 20 16:45:26 <tomman>	very handy for quickly surveying the local spectrum to find the least crowded channel
Feb 20 16:45:36 <tomman>	although at this state for 2.4GHz it's a lost hope
Feb 20 16:48:53 <whomp>	sadly i have an iphone
Feb 20 16:49:11 <shtrb>	time to get a librm5 or android ;-)
Feb 20 16:49:52 <JakLareo>	One of my neighbors has their Wi-Fi set up for a 40MHz channel width on channel 6, so they're interfering with literally every channel in the neighborhood :(
Feb 20 16:50:14 <JakLareo>	In 2.4 GHz, at least. Thank goodness for 5 & 6 GHz!
Feb 20 16:50:15 <shtrb>	shouldn't that be blocked by cfg80211 ? 
Feb 20 16:52:27 <tomman>	2.4GHz really only has 3 usable channels, everything else were electoral promises
Feb 20 17:17:51 <Whiskey`>	JakLareo: 40mhz on ch6 would kill ch1/6 or 6/11. unless you mean they used ch2/8 or 3/10
Feb 20 17:18:48 <Whiskey`>	shtrb: why would that be blocked? 40mhz is legal in 2.4ghz
Feb 20 17:27:00 <shtrb>	Whiskey`, I vaguely remember that 40 mhz channels had been blocked if there are a high level of interference 
Feb 20 17:32:17 *	shtrb reads about the option to use 120 mhz on 2.4 ghz and is amazed of the audacity of the user who would use it
Feb 20 17:33:14 <shtrb>	s/120/160/g
Feb 20 17:33:49 <Whiskey`>	yea you cant use 120/160

Feb 20 18:06:14 <shtrb>	sarcasm ? 
Feb 20 18:06:37 <nullvalue>	no truely - sarcasm i was not aware of this
Feb 20 18:06:54 <nullvalue>	thts a - minus there
Feb 20 18:08:39 <shtrb>	I tried to setup LOS two point commication in the past (I couldn't get a permit for an optical system then :-( ) 
Feb 20 18:09:33 <nullvalue>	should have migrated to a place where they allow for such research
Feb 20 18:09:47 <nullvalue>	some places just kills your dreams
Feb 20 18:09:58 <nullvalue>	with regulations and what nots
Feb 20 18:10:38 <shtrb>	not research , installation these had been industrial devices that we couldn't install (off-the-shelf products)
Feb 20 18:14:17 <nullvalue>	aah , yes they regulate this stuff, ive hear my professor tell me a similar story regarding some receivers that he had to personally to to customs and sign in for
Feb 20 18:14:44 <nullvalue>	they were off the shelf too, but not allowed in some countries etc...
Feb 20 18:32:07 <mdogg>	Whiskey`: A while back I was looking for an SFTP applicatoin for my iPhone and you said something like, "...you should use scp instead of sftp.."   Thanks /so/ much for suggesting that!  I can ssh from my phone to wherever I need to go and scp works great at handing my file transfers.  In fact, scp seems to transfer files faster than sftp though some people tell me it's just my imagination. 
Feb 20 18:33:43 <shtrb>	nullvalue, don't leave the acdemic world, the real workd is not that fun
Feb 20 18:34:07 <nullvalue>	ill try not to or maybe be in both worlds
Feb 20 18:34:09 <nullvalue>	:P
Feb 20 18:35:20 <shtrb>	mdogg, sftp connection can enable compression on the fly 
Feb 20 18:40:05 <mdogg>	I thought you had to request that as an option, like 'sftp -C user@website.com'
Feb 20 18:40:34 <shtrb>	yes , but that is on the fly compression
Feb 20 18:41:40 <mdogg>	Oh, I didn't know it did it on the fly.
Feb 20 18:41:42 <mdogg>	That's cool.
Feb 20 18:41:59 <shtrb>	* depened on the client 
Feb 20 18:42:26 <shtrb>	the compression is "on-the-fly" 
Feb 20 18:43:39 <kevin-oculus>	how does internet work can the A fiber-optic (broadband) spy on you or the broadband providers or both ?
Feb 20 18:43:50 <mdogg>	sftp is cool if you just want to manage files, but you can do that via ssh also.  Though you can't resume file transfers with scp like you can if an sftp connection quit working..  I started using scp after Whiskey` suggested it and it's like I just got a new toy.
Feb 20 18:45:11 <kevin-oculus>	I mean those companys who offers you @home fiber internet can they spy on you or only the broadband providers
Feb 20 18:45:12 <shtrb>	mdogg, fyi rsync might be more fun than sftp transfer , also the sftp client may be buggy in some OSes, I had migrated to winscp as it was more stable (on windows)
Feb 20 18:45:24 <shtrb>	kevin-oculus, both can spy on you
Feb 20 18:46:00 <shtrb>	kevin-oculus, for instance there was a case where the encryption on the down link was not enabled on one router installation , so any other person in your building could see what you get
Feb 20 18:46:14 <mdogg>	kevin-oculus: There are steps that you can take to mitigate the risk of exposure.
Feb 20 18:47:06 <kevin-oculus>	I allways though only the broadband providers can see what you do over internet not others
Feb 20 18:47:20 <kevin-oculus>	not fiber providers
Feb 20 18:47:36 <djph>	anyone on the link as the traffic hops around
Feb 20 18:47:48 <mdogg>	shtrb: I'll have to remember that if I use it in Windows.  I just purchased Win 11 Pro and I installed it in a VM because it was the only way I could run a software application called Bluebeam - it's not something I run very often but every now and then I gotta go into it.
Feb 20 18:48:46 <djph>	kevin-oculus: its like the post office.  any postal worker sees the envelopes you send/receive...
Feb 20 18:48:55 <mdogg>	That's a good way of putting it.
Feb 20 18:48:57 <djph>	well, any postal worker handling the mail anyway
Feb 20 18:49:07 <shtrb>	djph, post office have regulation and honest workers 
Feb 20 18:49:37 <djph>	shtrb: yes, because *doing their job* literally means "reading the envelope"
Feb 20 18:49:53 <mdogg>	And technically, the post office /could/ start creating a log of all mail with a particular address in either the 'to' field or the 'return to' field.  But that would be a massive undertaking and is not likely to happen.
Feb 20 18:50:24 <djph>	mdogg: I mean, it's all computers now.  They probably *have* that already
Feb 20 18:50:44 <kevin-oculus>	well know i know it yes postal workers can be bad guys but i never  thoug that the those who install fiber in your house will be able to see your broadband provider traffic 
Feb 20 18:50:49 <djph>	well, the capability, whether or not they bother keeping the logs .. 
Feb 20 18:50:54 <djph>	huh?
Feb 20 18:51:06 <djph>	why would an installer "see your traffic" ?
Feb 20 18:51:10 <mdogg>	Yes but there are things that can be done to circumvent that, such as changing your 'return' address to something else, or having mail sent to a different address and collecting it from there (VPN)
Feb 20 18:51:23 <djph>	I mean, other than for the 20-odd minutes they're there setting it up?
Feb 20 18:51:42 <kevin-oculus>	<djph> kevin-oculus: its like the post office.  any postal worker sees the envelopes you send/receive...
Feb 20 18:52:11 <shtrb>	djph, ISP provided router had disabled by default the downlink , let that sink in , and you have contract with an ISP that purchase service from a fiber optic provider that connect to your home :-)
Feb 20 18:52:13 <djph>	kevin-oculus: yeah, any of them who have to handle your mail (i.e. your ISP, your ISP's peers, Google/aws/etc.)
Feb 20 18:52:34 <mdogg>	They see it so they can put it in the correct mailbox during delivery, but when mail is sent, it is routed to the correct post office by an OCR.
Feb 20 18:52:53 <djph>	shtrb: I mean, any ISP in the middle can see I'm on IRC right now... 
Feb 20 18:53:15 <shtrb>	djph, isn't TLS port is default these days :P
Feb 20 18:53:19 <shtrb>	but yes
Feb 20 18:53:38 <djph>	because the enveloping en encrypted, amirite?
Feb 20 18:53:51 <djph>	*is encrypted
Feb 20 18:53:53 <Whiskey`>	mine is!
Feb 20 18:54:04 <mdogg>	I buy my own equipment, but in order for my modem to connect to the network I have to provide the ISP with the MAC address so they can allow the device.  
Feb 20 18:54:06 <Whiskey`>	but tls in email doesnt do crap when your sending server is wide open
Feb 20 18:54:13 <kevin-oculus>	djph yes thats true the ISP can see you are on the internet but does that same thing go with the those who gave you fiber internet in your house can they see you are on irc
Feb 20 18:54:33 <djph>	kevin-oculus: the guy who installed the fiber works for the ISP... 
Feb 20 18:54:41 <Whiskey`>	....
Feb 20 18:54:49 <mdogg>	Whiskey`: Wouldn't you get 'open relay' errors? 
Feb 20 18:54:59 <shtrb>	djph, that is not always true  ,I know quite a few companies that lease fiber optic services
Feb 20 18:55:04 <Whiskey`>	mdogg: thats not what i mean by wide open
Feb 20 18:55:14 <mdogg>	Oh, sorry
Feb 20 18:55:14 <shtrb>	Whiskey`, MTA-STS ... 
Feb 20 18:55:50 <shtrb>	also PGP/Mime for all e-mails :)
Feb 20 18:55:59 <kevin-oculus>	no its not the same thing.... i mean let say in a road named A the city offers on that road fiber connection and the houses there use fiber connection with ISP broadband provider do you understand what i am asking....
Feb 20 18:56:09 <djph>	kevin-oculus: if it's a leased connection (e.g. yourISP is leasing from AT&T / equivalent) then at some point AT&T *will* see your traffic, because it MUST cross their network... 
Feb 20 18:56:18 <mdogg>	kevin-oculus: I don't understand.
Feb 20 18:56:22 <Whiskey`>	kevin-oculus: no, because where we live the isp own that fiber, not the city
Feb 20 18:57:04 <Whiskey`>	kevin-oculus: if you have a fiber provider AND a separate Internet provider, both can see your packets
Feb 20 18:57:41 <kevin-oculus>	Whiskey  okay thats what i wanted to know
Feb 20 18:58:02 <kevin-oculus>	i thought on the separate broadband provider can see the traffic not the fiber provider
Feb 20 18:58:06 <kevin-oculus>	onluy
Feb 20 18:58:09 <kevin-oculus>	only
Feb 20 19:00:47 <Whiskey`>	it depends on a few things, but its safer to assume the fiber provider can see the packets too.
Feb 20 19:00:47 <kevin-oculus>	so both the fiber provider and the separate ISP can see iam on IRC
Feb 20 19:01:23 <djph>	well, yeah, "everyone" between you and the target has to handle the packets... same as the post office
Feb 20 19:01:25 <kevin-oculus>	I allways thought only ISP can spy on me
Feb 20 19:01:28 <Whiskey`>	depends. for us here, yes because the fiber own is also the isp. what you call a isp in this is a VAR, just a value reseller
Feb 20 19:02:33 <Whiskey`>	im sure some palce in the world someone owns the fiber and just leases strands and never puts any of their own hardware on it
Feb 20 19:03:08 <kevin-oculus>	so it depends on their setup if  they want to spy they can do it
Feb 20 19:03:28 <Whiskey`>	if they have packet handling hardware then yes
Feb 20 19:05:18 <kevin-oculus>	how common is it 
Feb 20 19:05:59 <shtrb>	you can assume that they do it ;-)
Feb 20 19:12:11 <kevin-oculus>	:(
Feb 20 19:14:57 <djph>	and then realize they do it for /all/ of their customers, and you're just kind of nothing in the grand scheme of things.
Feb 20 19:15:10 <djph>	... unless you give them reason to look more closely
Feb 20 19:16:06 <kevin-oculus>	<----------Enemy of the state
Feb 20 19:16:12 <shtrb>	let say by buying too much meat , using too much CO2 etc
Feb 20 19:20:29 <mdogg>	Consuming too much oxygen..
Feb 20 19:20:48 <djph>	mdogg: that's users in general.
Feb 20 19:21:08 <mdogg>	Yes..
Feb 20 19:22:30 <shtrb>	mdogg, now seriusly there is Co2 tax now in some places and an agremment on how much meat should a family consume in a week
Feb 20 19:25:27 <mdogg>	I've heard of Co2 having different taxes and stuff and I'm sure most cultures consume a certain amount of meat.  But as for meat, any individual can still go to Costco and buy as much as they want without anybody blinking an eye.
Feb 20 19:28:58 <mdogg>	For Co2, machinists use it quite a bit and it's also used as a media in high-pressure blasting - actually I was just talking to someone else about that earlier this morning.  You can blast little Co2 pellets (in their solid form) and remove paint from brick/masonry, and it can be used to gently remove dirt/debris from priceless paintings and bring them back to their original luster.  Once the Co2 hits the surface it freezes the undesirable 
Feb 20 19:28:58 <mdogg>	element and then it evaporates, leaving just the remaining paint/dirt/debris on the floor.
Feb 20 19:29:28 <shtrb>	right , meat tax and personal carbon footprint trackers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djpRUafjx7c 
Feb 20 19:31:28 <mdogg>	Obviously the pressure and pellet size would be different if you're trying to remove paint from a brick wall vs remove 100 years of dirt from a Georges Seurat.
Feb 20 19:31:58 <mdogg>	I have a Co2 tank on my kegerator.
Feb 20 19:33:19 <mdogg>	Well, most beer dispensers will use Co2 unless the beer calls for nitrogen (like Guinness). 
Feb 20 19:42:49 <Zewwy>	Ahhhh yes... another internet warrior scouring for vulnerable servers for "good" but probably selling the results to the highest bidder, to join the ranks of Stretchoid, and Linode we now have binaryedge.ninja
Feb 20 19:43:56 <Zewwy>	My favorite part about them is their use of service providers (Digital Ocean, and Akami) to source their servers/Pub IPs
Feb 20 19:44:24 <Blondie101010>	your point is unclear or very weird
Feb 20 19:45:25 <Blondie101010>	anyone can use thos providers, for whatever good or bad they do
Feb 20 19:45:46 <Zewwy>	https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/775-Scans-and-Attacks.html
Feb 20 19:46:07 <Blondie101010>	so reading that page will tell me your point???
Feb 20 19:46:13 <Blondie101010>	learn to be clear!
Feb 20 19:46:19 <Zewwy>	This is my point, I won't go over it in detail as its way to much to discuss in a oneline IRC chat, the point is I'm gettin tired of having to block service providers for services I never "opt'd" into
Feb 20 19:46:28 <Blondie101010>	not my question either
Feb 20 19:46:32 <Blondie101010>	you didn't make any point
Feb 20 19:46:45 <Zewwy>	You caught, oh m,aster of IRC intent and useage
Feb 20 19:46:52 <Blondie101010>	that should not take paragraphs, but a single line should suffice
Feb 20 19:47:07 <Zewwy>	Understood master. Waddles away in shame
Feb 20 19:47:10 <Blondie101010>	so your complaint is that some hackers use VPSs
Feb 20 19:47:20 <Blondie101010>	why wouldn't they?
Feb 20 19:47:28 <Zewwy>	That's just iceing on the cake
Feb 20 19:47:39 <Zewwy>	he point is I'm gettin tired of having to block service providers for services I never "opt'd" into
Feb 20 19:47:58 <Blondie101010>	if what they do is not according to the provider's T&C, then it's the provider's problem, but from what you pasted, I think they probably are cleaner than you
Feb 20 19:48:05 <Zewwy>	and yes reading that page comes into question moral and thics with such practiices
Feb 20 19:48:08 <Blondie101010>	ehmmm
Feb 20 19:48:17 <Zewwy>	if that is not to be discussed her, I'm sorry to have emtnioed it
Feb 20 19:48:20 <Blondie101010>	yeah that proves you have no idea what you're talking about
Feb 20 19:48:35 <Zewwy>	I'm so sorry, youare right, I am wrong, so sorry to hav ementioned it
Feb 20 19:48:37 <Blondie101010>	you can not reasonably filter properly based on a the IP block owner alone
Feb 20 19:48:41 <Blondie101010>	not at all!
Feb 20 19:48:52 <Zewwy>	Please forgive me
Feb 20 19:48:56 <Zewwy>	I'll be on my way
Feb 20 19:49:00 <Blondie101010>	don't have to
Feb 20 19:49:05 <Blondie101010>	I just discussed with you
Feb 20 19:49:42 <Zewwy>	Yes you stated you accuracy, and put me down in my place, thanks for being postive in nature, sorry to have disrupted this channel
Feb 20 19:50:14 <Blondie101010>	doing advanced filtering requires two things:  a) large volume of traffic to identify patterns; b) large bandwidth to tolerate large attacks
Feb 20 19:50:19 <Blondie101010>	do you have those 2?
Feb 20 19:50:25 <Blondie101010>	akamai and cloudflare do
Feb 20 19:50:42 <Zewwy>	Nice, I'm happy for those service proviers for havbing those two things
Feb 20 19:51:11 <Blondie101010>	well the point someone interested in learning could get from this, is that proper protection could require a third party service
Feb 20 19:51:21 <Zewwy>	Oh yes, I agree
Feb 20 21:22:53 <fourHZ>	once i have got here redirected to the fix you connection channel. now that dude from ISP told me that they were doing 2 link on 1 CAT cable. i mean they use the shielding as the secondary line... 100mbps all the time...
Feb 20 21:25:07 <Blondie101010>	that doesn't give a clear context...  is the bug causing you to be blocked now fixed?
Feb 20 21:28:18 <grawity>	1) an ISP doing that in prod needs to be whacked with a cat5, 2) it's not the shielding, 100mbps uses two pairs only, so *half the cable* (i.e. the unused pairs) is the secondary line
Feb 20 21:30:00 <fourHZ>	grawity: not sure which CAT it was. ad shielding i mean the twistid pair shieliding
Feb 20 21:31:00 <grawity>	that's not shielding, that's literally the cable itself
Feb 20 21:31:30 <fourHZ>	no the twist is a kind of shielding itself in the older ways of electronics
Feb 20 21:32:06 <fourHZ>	anyway i have now 1gb instead of 100mpbs
Feb 20 21:32:21 <mdogg>	Data is only transmitted over the conductors.  The shielding is only used to reduce electromagnetic interference. 
Feb 20 21:32:31 <mdogg>	..which is very important
Feb 20 21:36:32 <grawity>	fourHZ: doesn't mean you can "use the shielding as the secondary line", it only works when the line is twisted with itself
Feb 20 21:37:11 <xingu>	baseT outside plant? talk about playing with lightning.
Feb 20 21:38:34 <grawity>	we used to have some of that at work :|
Feb 20 21:39:33 <grawity>	"hmm where does this unmarked cable go" turns out it's a Just In Case cable that goes into the basement and into the underground pipe along with the fiber into the other building
Feb 20 21:39:37 <shtrb>	fourHZ, while we used to twist cables to shield, we also add extra layer and a mesh to prevent interference (and that is the shielding part)
Feb 20 21:41:08 <fourHZ>	shtrb: well i dont know how the isp did 2 hosts via one cat cable that remains a mystery. anyway i have now a proper one. rejoice!
Feb 20 21:47:49 <azonenberg>	Is there any way, on Linux, to have multiple IPv4 addresses on a single interface? Or I guess more generally, to put two IPv4 segments in a single layer 2 broadcast domain?
Feb 20 21:47:59 <grawity>	yes
Feb 20 21:48:15 <grawity>	in linux 2.2 you had the "alias" interfaces like eth0:0
Feb 20 21:48:16 <azonenberg>	scenario: I have a fairly typical /24 with rfc1918 addresses
Feb 20 21:48:24 <grawity>	in linux 2.4+ you can just `ip addr add` as many as you like
Feb 20 21:48:27 <azonenberg>	but i have a non-reconfigurable customer gizmo with a hard configured IP on it
Feb 20 21:48:31 <azonenberg>	that needs to live on that subnet as well
Feb 20 21:48:40 <azonenberg>	and i need to get my laptop to reach other LAN resources and also this thing :)
Feb 20 21:48:52 <grawity>	yeah, you can do that in probably every OS these days
Feb 20 21:49:03 <azonenberg>	Interesting. Never knew that was an option hence why i was asking
Feb 20 21:49:09 <azonenberg>	i was all ready to go grab a dongle and make a point to point link lol
Feb 20 21:49:11 <Blondie101010>	azonenberg:  you just add it
Feb 20 21:49:23 <Blondie101010>	as long as you don't have thousands, it's ok
Feb 20 21:49:27 <grawity>	linux - `ip addr add a.b.c.d/24 dev eth0` (keep in mind it won't show in ifconfig, it still expects the 2.2-era API)
Feb 20 21:49:40 <grawity>	bsd - `ifconfig em0 a.b.c.d/24 alias` or something like that, I forgot
Feb 20 21:49:52 <grawity>	windows - `netsh interface ipv4 add address etc etc etc`
Feb 20 21:49:53 <Blondie101010>	ip a # will show it
Feb 20 21:50:00 <azonenberg>	yeah i just have a single device from a client that left their site with their internal LAN address still baked into the config
Feb 20 21:50:06 <azonenberg>	and i cant change it, or if i can i need to be able to talk to it lol
Feb 20 21:50:13 <azonenberg>	(to make the change)
Feb 20 21:50:18 <Blondie101010>	yeah add it
Feb 20 21:50:23 <Blondie101010>	don't change anything
Feb 20 21:50:25 <azonenberg>	Thanks i'll try that :)
Feb 20 21:50:49 <azonenberg>	(the other fun is that the IP on it is a publicly routable IP... but presumably if the gizmo is here and not in their office i'll never need to route that traffic over the internet lol)
Feb 20 21:51:16 <azonenberg>	nor do i expect to have to hit anything else on adjacent addresses in the near future
Feb 20 21:51:23 <Blondie101010>	but you could always handle that as well
Feb 20 21:51:31 <Blondie101010>	it's on your network
Feb 20 21:51:47 <grawity>	configure your side as a /31, to reduce the impact
Feb 20 22:01:36 <azonenberg>	grawity: yeah that was the plan
Feb 20 22:50:16 <javi404>	Whiskey`: Blondie101010: the PoE -> PoE + USB adapter arrived, working perfect testing inside. Next test is the 25 foot run outside.
Feb 20 22:51:36 <javi404>	now i have an gigibit capable small solar array with a camera.
Feb 20 23:56:48 <chives>	Anyone know what am i searching wrong trying to do a reverse whois lookup i cant remember what the reverse syntax is for looking up who owns an ip range?
Feb 20 23:57:04 <chives>	all my google results appear to be chatgpt bots
Feb 20 23:57:25 <chives>	"what is a search_terms_you_asked"
Feb 21 00:15:10 <chives>	nevermind easier than remembered whois command... guess im thinking reverse dns lookup
Feb 21 00:16:12 <chives>	was thiking id need to remember in-addr.arpa maybe

Feb 21 01:07:42 <chives>	oh ok need to get back to work one day sadly
Feb 21 01:39:58 <tomman>	wtf, I found a domain that resolves to 127.0.0.1 :D
Feb 21 01:40:04 <tomman>	an actual website
Feb 21 01:40:34 <tomman>	at first I thought it was either an expired domain or something caught by my DNS blocklists, but dig tells me it resolves to... localhost
Feb 21 01:40:44 <tomman>	even when asking to Google or Clownflare public DNS
Feb 21 01:40:53 <tomman>	wonder what happened there
Feb 21 01:50:06 <Dex2x>	well back to the books I guess, setting the gpon_sn and vendor Id, did not get me O5 OLT Auth :( 
Feb 21 01:50:28 <tomman>	Speaking of that...
Feb 21 01:50:55 <tomman>	How do fiber ISPs "lock out" their ONTs so you can use the ISP-provided ones instead of buying a new TP-Stink one for $25?
Feb 21 01:51:07 <tomman>	let's assume that they're not using proprietary firmware
Feb 21 01:51:15 <tomman>	(our ISPs are too small for that)
Feb 21 01:51:42 <tomman>	my telco charges $30 for a new V-Sol brick, which I can buy for $20 online with free shipping
Feb 21 01:52:02 <tomman>	(or I can buy a TP-Link one for $30, with a 3 year warranty)
Feb 21 01:52:23 <tomman>	they claim I have to buy from them, but nearly every fiber ISP in town uses the same V-Sol gear
Feb 21 02:22:42 <Whiskey`>	javi404: it will work the same, assuming you got a good af unit
Feb 21 03:15:18 <RoyalYork__>	tomman, about the domain that resolves to 127.0.0.1, I would imagine that they are using the domain name internally within their lan 
Feb 21 03:15:55 <tomman>	no, it was a domain for a commercial piece of software from Ukraine
Feb 21 03:15:58 <RoyalYork__>	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41555205/why-do-some-public-dns-records-resolve-to-127-0-01
Feb 21 03:16:36 <RoyalYork__>	I would imagine that with the conflict, they are taking themselves offline
Feb 21 03:16:54 <RoyalYork__>	its hard for intruders to attempt to access the systems if they resolve to a local host
Feb 21 03:18:23 <RoyalYork__>	But this company can still use their domain internally
Feb 21 03:18:29 <mane>	alright
Feb 21 03:18:50 <mane>	lets get real
Feb 21 03:18:54 <mane>	networking
Feb 21 03:18:57 <mane>	jokes aside
Feb 21 03:19:27 <mane>	no one gets fooled over here
Feb 21 03:20:12 <mane>	time to get serious
Feb 21 03:20:42 <RoyalYork__>	Alright guys.... the client is here. Let's pretend we're working and not on reddit
Feb 21 03:23:16 <tomman>	RoyalYork__: this specific piece of software is used for servicing a specific brand of hard disk drives firmware, and relies on an always-on Internet connection (to servers hosted in UK and Germany, from what I could check)
Feb 21 03:23:35 <tomman>	but their main website is dead, and looks like it has been dead for months
Feb 21 03:23:52 <tomman>	what surprised me was that the domain resolves to 127.0.0.1
Feb 21 03:24:03 <tomman>	instead of something like NXDOMAIN or a empty record
Feb 21 03:24:36 <Blondie101010>	pointing your public zone records to a lo IP can be used for CSRF
Feb 21 03:24:43 <Blondie101010>	do not do that
Feb 21 03:25:06 <mane>	did you realize that you can nuke _anything_
Feb 21 03:25:17 <mane>	it's pretty universal
Feb 21 03:25:17 <RoyalYork__>	tomman, I mean there is a war going on there. I wouldn't expect everything to be functional
Feb 21 03:25:39 <mane>	it does not ask about race religion, gender, etc
Feb 21 03:26:08 <Whiskey`>	yea splitting adams is trivial and makes a huge mess
Feb 21 03:26:10 <mane>	you don't need to be anyone special to get nuked
Feb 21 03:26:21 <javi404>	Whiskey`: yep, both are AF capable.
Feb 21 03:26:31 <javi404>	af and at
Feb 21 03:26:34 <tomman>	RoyalYork__: the war part doesn't surprise me (but their main website was open for business up to mid '23 at least, which DOES surprise me)
Feb 21 03:26:42 <javi404>	ill know tomorrow
Feb 21 03:26:49 <javi404>	busy tonight
Feb 21 03:26:58 <tomman>	Anyway, I think this is the first time I see a domain resolving like that
Feb 21 03:26:59 <mane>	you just get dissolved in wave of fire
Feb 21 03:27:11 <javi404>	Whiskey`: did you see the youtube video or the news about that stolen coms tower?
Feb 21 03:27:31 <javi404>	there were 2 actually. some AM station and another tower that is 200 feet. how the fuck did someone miss that?
Feb 21 03:27:37 <javi404>	no motion sensors? cams?
Feb 21 03:27:38 <Blondie101010>	there is really no valid reason to point a DNS record to lo
Feb 21 03:27:47 <mane>	this leaves very little questions
Feb 21 03:27:52 <mane>	easy to understand
Feb 21 03:28:06 <mane>	makes life easier to get
Feb 21 03:28:15 <Whiskey`>	javi404: yea i knew aobut it before the news did
Feb 21 03:28:37 <javi404>	that's crazy, what were they methhead scrappers?
Feb 21 03:28:50 <Whiskey`>	javi404: I am not allowed to comment.
Feb 21 03:29:19 <javi404>	i want a tower, but not willing to steal one, lol.
Feb 21 03:31:01 <javi404>	actually, im just going to put an antenna on a tall palm tree, just to get TV for emergency situations etc.
Feb 21 03:31:14 <javi404>	just need to actually do it.
Feb 21 03:31:42 <javi404>	still haven't mapped out all the coax here, pain in the ass old shit.
Feb 21 03:32:06 <javi404>	have a bundle of like 6 cables popping out and cut in the garden near an old directv dish.
Feb 21 03:32:24 <mane>	if you coyuld nuke someone who would that be
Feb 21 03:32:26 <javi404>	not gonna cut it because might as well use it if I can for something if i figure out point A to point B.
Feb 21 03:32:38 <javi404>	mane: how about not nuke anyone?
Feb 21 03:32:39 <RoyalYork__>	mane, you keep asking a lot about nukes
Feb 21 03:32:40 <mane>	remember, better if the have no nukes
Feb 21 03:32:51 <mane>	it's a pretty important detail
Feb 21 03:33:05 <RoyalYork__>	The only Nuke I use is Duke Nukem
Feb 21 03:33:38 <javi404>	yeah, if we build more nuclear power plants we will have clean energy and no one will need to nuke anyone hopefully.
Feb 21 03:34:25 <mane>	i never wondered about who would i like to nuke
Feb 21 03:34:27 <tomman>	wait, no Nuka-Cola?
Feb 21 03:34:35 <mane>	it's not my box of apples
Feb 21 03:35:02 <mane>	i don't nuke countries and that's final
Feb 21 03:35:10 <mane>	i don't take bribes too
Feb 21 03:35:48 <mane>	ask someone else
Feb 21 03:35:54 <mane>	best of luck
Feb 21 03:36:43 <wwalker>	I need to fine the private IP of a device I have here.  What is the fastest tool for either sending ARP requests to a specific IP (I have it narrowed down to about 200,000 possible addresses) or ping them or port scan 80 and 443.
Feb 21 03:36:56 <Blondie101010>	javi404:  glad to see comments that make sense
Feb 21 03:37:24 <mane>	don't spam me with nuke requests
Feb 21 03:37:29 <mane>	i wont respond
Feb 21 03:37:47 <RoyalYork__>	wwalker, rustscan is pretty quick. I use it internally all the time
Feb 21 03:37:57 <wwalker>	RoyalYork__: thank you
Feb 21 03:38:13 <mane>	but if i was to decide i'd pick new zeland
Feb 21 03:38:18 <mane>	just look at them
Feb 21 03:38:26 <tomman>	Well, I'll visit my customer next Thursday, hopefully the $10/mo IT slaves will have finished the inventory this time
Feb 21 03:38:28 <mane>	they're useless
Feb 21 03:38:36 <tomman>	so the next stage is labeling all those network cables and jacks
Feb 21 03:38:41 <javi404>	Blondie101010: appreciated.
Feb 21 03:38:41 <tomman>	so we can do the new network map
Feb 21 03:38:43 <mane>	but i will never push the button
Feb 21 03:38:44 <tomman>	and here is my question
Feb 21 03:39:10 <tomman>	We want to segment this network in 3 subnets at least (because $RAISINS)
Feb 21 03:39:53 <tomman>	a "outer" subnet (which will host common stuff like servers), and some "inner" subnets which will help isolating departments and stuff
Feb 21 03:40:13 <tomman>	what's the simplest way to achieve this? VLANs or "just chain routers to routers"?
Feb 21 03:40:28 <mane>	that's like being true, one with the will of nature
Feb 21 03:41:01 <RoyalYork__>	tomman, do you have managed switches? thats the first question
Feb 21 03:41:06 <tomman>	their current network infra seems to be a bunch of (unmanaged?) gigabit switches
Feb 21 03:41:20 <tomman>	a RouterBoard and some cheapo TP-Stink
Feb 21 03:41:28 <tomman>	that's what I've seen so far
Feb 21 03:41:47 <tomman>	so yeah, that will be the second thing to take note when labeling dozens of network jacks
Feb 21 03:42:07 <mane>	but nukes work for everyone exactly the same
Feb 21 03:42:08 <Whiskey`>	tomman: just use a proper router and vlans
Feb 21 03:42:17 <Whiskey`>	you dont have 'in' and 'out' subnets.
Feb 21 03:42:27 <tomman>	and this is something I've never done (and most likely those IT drones haven't done either)
Feb 21 03:42:46 <Whiskey`>	well no time to learn like on the job
Feb 21 03:42:58 <tomman>	it's the one eyed man leading a pack of blinds :D
Feb 21 03:43:17 <Whiskey`>	yea but the one eyeyd man has backup, cause hes not stupid.
Feb 21 03:43:52 <tomman>	at least I told the managers there that most likely they'll have to shell out for some new networking gear at least
Feb 21 03:44:10 <tomman>	so once I get that current network map done, I'll be asking questions
Feb 21 03:44:14 <mane>	but nuking countries is not my thing
Feb 21 03:44:28 <tomman>	the plan is this: Department A must not access resources from Department B or C
Feb 21 03:44:28 <mane>	ihave zero experience with that
Feb 21 03:44:30 <RoyalYork__>	tomman, once your network map is done stick around
Feb 21 03:44:41 <tomman>	and Department B likewise must not access resources from A or C
Feb 21 03:44:48 <mane>	ask someone smarter
Feb 21 03:44:50 <tomman>	but there is this server that must be accessible from A, B, and C
Feb 21 03:44:58 <RoyalYork__>	VLANs would be your best bet
Feb 21 03:45:00 <mane>	there is plenty of them
Feb 21 03:45:07 <tomman>	(and it currently lives at A, but most likely we'll move it to the switch room, where it belongs)
Feb 21 03:45:16 <Whiskey`>	tomman: well, whats the mikrotik? i get unamange switches are trash tho
Feb 21 03:45:35 <mane>	i mean, at least that's what the say
Feb 21 03:45:39 <tomman>	dunno what they're using it for, looks like one of their lowest end RouterBoards
Feb 21 03:45:46 <tomman>	a white box with no antennas
Feb 21 03:45:51 <mane>	every legend has a grain of truth
Feb 21 03:46:01 <tomman>	I did spotted it connected to a fiber ONT
Feb 21 03:46:02 <Whiskey`>	tomman: that could be anything. whats the primary router?
Feb 21 03:46:11 <tomman>	so most likely that's what it's being used for
Feb 21 03:46:38 <Whiskey`>	ok well if its a semi decent one like a hex, you cna make each of the lan ports a different subnet and block access between
Feb 21 03:46:41 <tomman>	But there is also another room with racks and switches (and possibly moar consoomer routers) which I've yet to visit
Feb 21 03:46:51 <Whiskey`>	oh boy
Feb 21 03:46:59 <tomman>	the switches I saw were 16/32-port TP-Links which look new-ish
Feb 21 03:47:04 <tomman>	and a dead 3Com unit
Feb 21 03:47:09 <Whiskey`>	well get model numbers
Feb 21 03:47:29 <tomman>	OK, definitely gonna take notes of that, will be part of the inventory then
Feb 21 03:47:46 <Whiskey`>	yea cause that will tell you if you cna use some vlans or not.
Feb 21 03:47:59 <tomman>	Not all departments will be part of this network "reform", but half of the building will be
Feb 21 03:48:18 <tomman>	(well, not yet, the managers want to "secure" the core departments for them)
Feb 21 03:48:18 <Whiskey`>	uhm
Feb 21 03:48:18 <RoyalYork__>	tomman, have you drawn up a network diagram
Feb 21 03:48:26 <RoyalYork__>	usually helps in sitatuions of this sort
Feb 21 03:48:30 <tomman>	this is what i'm working on with the IT slaves
Feb 21 03:48:32 <Whiskey`>	thats not going ot work out well if they have mixed networking kit
Feb 21 03:48:47 <tomman>	and most likely will be the bulk of the job for my next visit
Feb 21 03:48:52 <tomman>	s
Feb 21 03:49:03 <Whiskey`>	yea sounds like a good 2 or 3 days of work
Feb 21 03:49:12 <dogbert2>	yawn...
Feb 21 03:49:19 <tomman>	I have a 11-month contract for this shit, so don't worry :D
Feb 21 03:49:20 <RoyalYork__>	tomman, are you a consultant or do you work in house?
Feb 21 03:49:29 <tomman>	I'm a consultant on this one
Feb 21 03:49:48 <tomman>	which lets me charge more than the government standard ~$10/mo wages :D
Feb 21 03:49:55 <tomman>	(did I mention this is a public government office?)
Feb 21 03:50:10 <tomman>	and yes, mixed hardware is the reality here, welcome to Veneuela
Feb 21 03:50:12 <tomman>	--Venezuela
Feb 21 03:50:18 <mane>	of course this isnt fair at all but purely honest
Feb 21 03:50:51 <Whiskey`>	can you maybe get them to buy some hardware? or find a trash pile to dig in?
Feb 21 03:50:58 <mane>	very few can appreciate that
Feb 21 03:51:36 <tomman>	Whiskey`: at least I did warned them that most likely they will have to buy some hardware, and they agreed to
Feb 21 03:52:15 <tomman>	but then, they basically buy all their junk from Honest Tarek's Computerizers And Sewing Machines
Feb 21 03:52:18 <mane>	\i don't like to fool people around
Feb 21 03:52:32 <mane>	i like to keep things clear
Feb 21 03:53:07 <tomman>	the origins of the Mikrotik box are unclear (possibly ISP-supplied?) since no local seller sells those, and government can't really buy from MercadoLibre
Feb 21 03:53:21 <mane>	so everyone simply has less problems to solve
Feb 21 03:53:32 <mane>	and life is easier to understand
Feb 21 03:53:53 <mane>	not too many get lost
Feb 21 03:54:14 <tomman>	Whiskey`: another thing I now reminded
Feb 21 03:54:18 <tomman>	they have two ISPs
Feb 21 03:54:49 <mane>	and what i value about me is good intentions
Feb 21 03:55:04 <tomman>	we have remote access to our server box via some port redirections (we did managed them to pay for a static IP, which one of the ISPs thankfully supplied)
Feb 21 03:55:16 <tomman>	but... the way the port redirect is set is weird
Feb 21 03:55:30 <tomman>	can connect just fine from ISP A (the one supplying the static IP)
Feb 21 03:55:56 <tomman>	but the server box itself gets to the Internet through ISP B!
Feb 21 03:56:16 <tomman>	(this dumbfounded me when the box was reporting the wrong public IP to our customer portal)
Feb 21 03:57:37 <tomman>	In fact most of the boxes on the same LAN go outside via ISP B, dunno what's the role of ISP A here
Feb 21 03:58:31 <tomman>	(or why they have two fiber ISPs in first place, but then they're coming from shittacular CANTV's DSL which was down half of the week despite a cable locker sitting just in front of the town hall building entrance!)
Feb 21 04:01:48 <mane>	also there is some kind of wisdom in that
Feb 21 04:02:03 <mane>	worth noting down
Feb 21 04:03:03 <mane>	one things i learnt in life
Feb 21 04:03:30 <mane>	but on a different scale
Feb 21 04:04:14 <mane>	lately i try to act in peace with nature
Feb 21 04:04:50 <mane>	and i discover truths about reality
Feb 21 04:05:32 <mane>	i must say i'm quite gifted
Feb 21 04:08:15 <Whiskey`>	tomman: uhg. they dont have the routing setup right
Feb 21 04:08:37 <tomman>	it's a hodgepodge of cables and boxes, indeed
Feb 21 04:08:48 <tomman>	but that's our local governments for ya~
Feb 21 04:09:36 <Whiskey`>	tomman: lovely. well get that tik model, it sounds like that might be the best place to start this
Feb 21 04:09:47 <Whiskey`>	and ofc take pics of everything
Feb 21 04:09:54 <tomman>	noted~
Feb 21 04:10:09 <Whiskey`>	i take picks like a teen takes selfies
Feb 21 04:10:12 <Whiskey`>	pic's
Feb 21 04:10:59 <tomman>	now I regret about having not took that pic of the shoehorned xmas tree on the switches room :D
Feb 21 04:11:25 <tomman>	(which judging from the ceramic tiles on the walls, most likely began life as a bathroom)
Feb 21 04:17:58 <Whiskey`>	lovely
Feb 21 04:18:10 <Whiskey`>	makes sense, closer access for the water cooling....
Feb 21 05:32:00 <mane>	one mad had a simple message once
Feb 21 05:32:06 <mane>	i had doubds
Feb 21 05:32:12 <mane>	i shown dissbelief
Feb 21 05:32:33 <mane>	and it's very easy to understand
Feb 21 05:32:51 <mane>	i presented ignorance
Feb 21 05:33:13 <mane>	it's hardly a virtue
Feb 21 05:33:58 <mane>	i guess i am just a bit prejudiced
Feb 21 05:35:02 <mane>	as you age you start to nunderstand in a bit different way
Feb 21 05:35:30 <mane>	you look at things from a different perspective
Feb 21 05:36:55 <mane>	i start to respect talented, gifted people a lot, it is a vaue and i should know to learn from them
Feb 21 05:37:02 <mane>	whenever i can
Feb 21 05:37:06 <mane>	i improved
Feb 21 05:38:04 <mane>	if i only listen more i could exceed the masters
Feb 21 05:38:17 <mane>	but i just like to yap around
Feb 21 05:39:07 <mane>	however, some people i know don't realize how much they told me
Feb 21 05:39:29 <mane>	they didn't even realize they're brilliant
Feb 21 05:40:26 <mane>	i had luck to learn from the very best gifted
Feb 21 05:41:06 <mane>	by the choice of fate
Feb 21 05:42:22 <mane>	so, life does not always mess with you
Feb 21 05:42:44 <mane>	sometimes fate smiles at you
Feb 21 05:44:51 <mane>	no one informed them their brilliant
Feb 21 05:44:58 <mane>	it was hard to expect
Feb 21 05:46:01 <mane>	but thats only for good, they had no limits
Feb 21 05:49:25 <mane>	no one admited their gifts neither
Feb 21 05:49:39 <mane>	i can see that from perspective of time
Feb 21 05:50:11 <mane>	it was all normal
Feb 21 05:50:30 <mane>	just reality, nothing special
Feb 21 05:51:24 <mane>	now we dont fit
Feb 21 05:52:00 <mane>	we're relicts of the past
Feb 21 05:52:11 <mane>	and past is nasty
Feb 21 05:52:34 <mane>	it's 21st centaury now, follow the trends
Feb 21 05:52:50 <mane>	don't be a looser
Feb 21 05:54:19 <mane>	or you don't make it
Feb 21 05:54:31 <mane>	and trust me, it's not a lie
Feb 21 05:54:47 <mane>	i can prove it tho if you have any doubts
Feb 21 05:58:52 <mane>	and i was that clueless guy that is constantly laghing the lass off and having time of his life
Feb 21 05:59:22 <mane>	yea i learnt a lot
Feb 21 06:00:59 <mane>	yeah i taken the role of the public and i felt ok with it
Feb 21 06:01:20 <mane>	no mone ever appreciated that
Feb 21 06:01:43 <mane>	public is kinda important during the shows
Feb 21 06:02:24 <mane>	it's not like i had much to say anyway
Feb 21 06:03:00 <FlorianBad>	If I have a Linux router that forwards some private interfaces to public internet using iptables, is there a way to make all this go through an ssh socks instead of that public interface?
Feb 21 06:05:07 <mane>	it just happend i was able to notice the quality of the content in full spectrum
Feb 21 06:07:02 <mane>	the dopamine rushes were kinda insane
Feb 21 06:07:22 <mane>	i was a quality crowd
Feb 21 06:07:40 <nullvalue>	i get that sometime from here, irc induced dopomine and seretonin's
Feb 21 06:07:47 <nullvalue>	:P
Feb 21 06:08:36 <mane>	but no one ever noticed that and all i got was pain from a clueless thug for no reason
Feb 21 06:08:43 <mane>	and the sads begun
Feb 21 06:09:01 <mane>	and it was over
Feb 21 06:10:17 <mane>	but lie isnt fair
Feb 21 06:10:26 <mane>	<and pain isnt a lie
Feb 21 06:10:35 <mane>	so its all cool
Feb 21 06:12:18 <jacekowski>	i have issue with linux router and mtu
Feb 21 06:13:23 <jacekowski>	hmm
Feb 21 06:21:24 <mane>	well in healthy condition i would be rewarder for my level
Feb 21 06:21:49 <mane>	maybe someone would consider fart me once in a while
Feb 21 06:22:00 <mane>	just in the name of manners
Feb 21 06:22:33 <rustyaxe>	what gibberish bot is this we have now
Feb 21 06:22:35 <mane>	or at least trick me that i can but well so ibelieve
Feb 21 06:22:54 <mane>	dont take it ugly and unfun
Feb 21 06:23:03 <jacekowski>	actually, not linux issue
Feb 21 06:23:12 <jacekowski>	i'm tethering right now
Feb 21 06:23:30 <jacekowski>	and it is clearly MTU issues because "larger" packets are silently dropped
Feb 21 06:23:39 <jacekowski>	without icmp fragmentation needed
Feb 21 06:24:39 <Whiskey`>	jacekowski: fun. how are you testing that
Feb 21 06:24:49 <Whiskey`>	and what are 'larger'
Feb 21 06:26:03 <mane>	but you know life isnt fair and need no proofs for that
Feb 21 06:27:06 <jacekowski>	ping -f -l jacekowski.org
Feb 21 06:27:18 <mane>	and just to make thing clear, there is no justice
Feb 21 06:27:37 <mane>	i just don't want to live in illusion
Feb 21 06:27:42 <jacekowski>	ping -f -l 1400 jacekowski.org
Feb 21 06:27:56 <mane>	i like to keep things clear and simple
Feb 21 06:28:18 <mane>	it rises quality of life
Feb 21 06:28:19 <Whiskey`>	and the response is
Feb 21 06:28:33 <grawity>	maybe "larger" packets get through just fine, but the *reply* packets back to you don't, in which case <icmp frag needed> would be seen on the server side, not on your side
Feb 21 06:28:37 <jacekowski>	there is no response
Feb 21 06:28:42 <jacekowski>	with 1350 i get response
Feb 21 06:28:47 <grawity>	this kind of shit is very often asymmetric
Feb 21 06:29:01 <Whiskey`>	grawity: exactly where i was going
Feb 21 06:29:01 <jacekowski>	grawity: no, i have tcpdump at remote end
Feb 21 06:29:06 <Whiskey`>	jacekowski: hmmm
Feb 21 06:29:27 <grawity>	jacekowski: and you don't see the original icmp echo going through at all?
Feb 21 06:29:30 <jacekowski>	"larger" thing is beig dropped without necessary icmp returned
Feb 21 06:29:34 <jacekowski>	grawity: nope
Feb 21 06:29:40 <jacekowski>	with -l 1350 it gets through
Feb 21 06:29:45 <jacekowski>	but with -l 1400 it is dropped
Feb 21 06:29:46 <grawity>	what's your mobile carrier just out of curiosity
Feb 21 06:29:50 <jacekowski>	UK
Feb 21 06:29:56 <jacekowski>	where all shit mobile networks live
Feb 21 06:29:59 <Whiskey`>	have you tried sending other packets
Feb 21 06:30:09 <jacekowski>	yes
Feb 21 06:30:09 <Whiskey`>	and i assume you have noticed other network issues right?
Feb 21 06:30:11 <grawity>	can't be more shit than mine, who drops all icmp that's not icmp echo
Feb 21 06:30:19 <jacekowski>	rdp shits itself
Feb 21 06:30:35 <jacekowski>	that's how i noticed 
Feb 21 06:30:44 <Whiskey`>	well poopies, so you need ot do some tests, find exactly where the cut off is, and change your own mtu to match
Feb 21 06:31:03 <jacekowski>	so i either have shit hotel wifi or shit tethering
Feb 21 06:31:14 <Whiskey`>	i guess
Feb 21 06:31:20 <Whiskey`>	wait
Feb 21 06:31:28 <Whiskey`>	this is going on with 2 diff internets?
Feb 21 06:31:36 <Whiskey`>	from the same device?
Feb 21 06:31:38 <jacekowski>	no, hotel wifi has ok mtu
Feb 21 06:31:42 <jacekowski>	but it is shit slow
Feb 21 06:31:42 <Blondie101010>	jacekowski:  are you sure you're not simply hitting a rate limit firewall rule?
Feb 21 06:31:46 <grawity>	I assume they tried to get tethering working so as to avoid shit hotel wifi
Feb 21 06:32:05 <Blondie101010>	ping -f # is bad
Feb 21 06:32:09 <jacekowski>	(i'm not paying for faste hotel wifi)
Feb 21 06:32:19 <jacekowski>	Blondie101010: windows
Feb 21 06:32:27 <jacekowski>	Blondie101010: -f sets don't fragment on windows
Feb 21 06:32:44 <grawity>	actually, wait, do you not use a vpn for this?
Feb 21 06:32:47 <Blondie101010>	stupid windows
Feb 21 06:32:47 <grawity>	do you just rdp via WAN?
Feb 21 06:32:59 <mane>	thats the form of preserving information i found attractive
Feb 21 06:32:59 <jacekowski>	i use vpn, but it was dropping my vpn packets
Feb 21 06:33:32 <mane>	i just like it
Feb 21 06:33:34 <grawity>	because rdp would generally just adapt to the vpn adapter's MTU, wouldn't it
Feb 21 06:33:42 <mane>	it's pretty
Feb 21 06:33:58 <jacekowski>	grawity: it would, but because there is no don't fragment being returned all MTU detection shits itself
Feb 21 06:34:17 <jacekowski>	let me try it from the phone directly
Feb 21 06:34:32 <grawity>	use linux, it has tcp-level pmtud for that purpose >_>
Feb 21 06:34:34 <grawity>	I'm joking, but
Feb 21 06:34:43 <grawity>	wonder if windows has that too somewhere
Feb 21 06:34:52 <jacekowski>	afaik it still needs icmp to work
Feb 21 06:35:04 <grawity>	no, it specifically has "mtu blackhole" detection
Feb 21 06:35:52 <grawity>	I *think* I've seen some VPN software have MTU probing... was an article like yesterday, so of course I can't remmeber anything about it at all
Feb 21 06:35:55 <jacekowski>	yep, it's the same shit directly from the phone
Feb 21 06:36:04 <jacekowski>	fuck me
Feb 21 06:36:33 <grawity>	well, configure your vpn client to have a lower mtu, problem temporarily dealt with
Feb 21 06:36:55 <Whiskey`>	jacekowski: the wife doesn't approve of that.
Feb 21 06:42:52 <mane>	sometimes tho
Feb 21 06:43:08 <mane>	you meet someone that will understand you
Feb 21 06:43:31 <mane>	despite your missleading image of a crazy bum
Feb 21 06:44:13 <mane>	that many find convincing
Feb 21 06:44:32 <mane>	and it's a safe bet
Feb 21 06:44:47 <mane>	so why to risk
Feb 21 06:45:04 <mane>	if there is a general agreement
Feb 21 06:45:15 <mane>	and everyone benefits from that
Feb 21 06:46:03 <mane>	at least there are no disputes
Feb 21 06:46:50 <mane>	so people  get too much stress for life
Feb 21 06:47:14 <mane>	and life has some quality
Feb 21 06:47:25 <rustyaxe>	javi404: that 'stolen' tower was dismantled months ago
Feb 21 06:47:34 <mane>	you have less reasons to get depressed
Feb 21 06:47:56 <mane>	it is good for mental health
Feb 21 06:47:57 <rustyaxe>	have you seen the pictures/video of the transmitter building? aint no way that thing was up even 6 months ago lol
Feb 21 06:50:17 <mane>	and antidepressants are no fun
Feb 21 06:50:37 <mane>	better prevent than heal
Feb 21 06:53:40 <rustyaxe>	Dr Mario says smoke 2 joints and you'll be fine.
Feb 21 06:54:53 <mane>	marijuana sets me in bad mood
Feb 21 06:55:03 <mane>	it's not for me
Feb 21 06:55:42 <mane>	i chosen stimulants, they extend my creativity
Feb 21 06:56:10 <mane>	i found a legal way to extend them
Feb 21 06:56:22 <mane>	obtain*
Feb 21 06:56:27 <mane>	i'm pretty gifted
Feb 21 06:56:50 <sittingduck>	Turn down the enter key abuse, you spammer.
Feb 21 06:57:16 <mane>	thanks to them i get even better ideas
Feb 21 06:57:33 <mane>	sometimes i suprise myself
Feb 21 06:57:51 <sittingduck>	catphish allie Allie` calm this guy's tits down pls. mlu too.
Feb 21 06:58:11 <rustyaxe>	sittingduck: they still babbling?
Feb 21 06:58:38 <mane>	very often i go beyond scale
Feb 21 07:00:03 <mane>	and this makes me satisfied i again exceeded my limitations
Feb 21 07:00:15 <mane>	i reached new level
Feb 21 07:00:22 <mane>	set a new score
Feb 21 07:01:04 <mane>	sorry i'm in mood of telling abut myself
Feb 21 07:01:34 <sittingduck>	rustyaxe: damn right "it" is.
Feb 21 07:01:34 <mane>	maybe this goes unnoticed so i just wast to get more familiar
Feb 21 07:01:53 <mane>	you know
Feb 21 07:02:09 <mane>	you have a chance to know me better
Feb 21 07:02:19 <mane>	not just ignore
Feb 21 07:02:29 <mane>	value this opportunity
Feb 21 07:02:56 <mane>	i know i am pretty unique so you might find it interesting
Feb 21 07:03:20 <mane>	i'm not that common
Feb 21 07:03:48 <mane>	but i'm mortal as us all
Feb 21 07:04:22 <rustyaxe>	we get spammed by cheap automatons and drunken humans quite regularly here
Feb 21 07:05:29 <mane>	well if you really want to know a valued being something else
Feb 21 07:06:14 <mane>	it gave an illusion of being unique
Feb 21 07:06:36 <mane>	and i wanted to be unique
Feb 21 07:06:48 <mane>	and i became unique eventually
Feb 21 07:07:32 <mane>	as a consequence i dont belong anywhere
Feb 21 07:07:40 <mane>	but thats not a biggie
Feb 21 07:07:58 <mane>	no reason to worry
Feb 21 07:09:47 <mane>	but yeah, i oftenly reach my goals
Feb 21 07:12:57 <mane>	it's just that i destroy everything in between
Feb 21 07:13:21 <mane>	but sometimes no one looks at that or cares
Feb 21 07:13:51 <mane>	sometimes i don't get in much trouble
Feb 21 07:14:23 <mane>	so it is kinda beneficial
Feb 21 07:15:44 <mane>	sometimes i brak a bone but this is a part of the game
Feb 21 07:17:01 <mane>	just to get a better look on my persona
Feb 21 07:17:29 <mane>	not too many notice of that
Feb 21 07:17:32 <mane>	that
Feb 21 07:18:56 <mane>	so people are unaware
Feb 21 07:19:17 <mane>	they don't realize
Feb 21 07:19:40 <mane>	and i'm oftenly missunderstod
Feb 21 07:19:58 <mane>	and i dont get appreciation
Feb 21 07:20:19 <mane>	which bugs me a lot
Feb 21 07:20:46 <mane>	because i'm so unique after all
Feb 21 07:24:57 <mane>	well
Feb 21 07:25:13 <mane>	sometimes whati do mis hard to understand
Feb 21 07:25:28 <mane>	so people just give up
Feb 21 07:25:39 <rustyaxe>	Probably because noone wants to scroll thirtyseven pages of 5 words on a line searching for a coherent thought in the sea of words...
Feb 21 07:26:02 <mane>	ignore, carry on
Feb 21 07:26:31 <mane>	stop thinking too much about weird thinks
Feb 21 07:26:51 <mane>	things
Feb 21 07:27:08 <mane>	and so many wonderfull things go unnoticed that way
Feb 21 07:27:20 <mane>	all this effort for nothing
Feb 21 07:28:14 <mane>	and i get no appreciation
Feb 21 07:28:34 <mane>	not fair
Feb 21 07:29:18 <mane>	just to bring my person closer to understanding
Feb 21 07:29:30 <mane>	i want you to be aware
Feb 21 07:32:46 <mane>	one thing that i never understood is violence
Feb 21 07:33:00 <mane>	its outside my spectrum of recognition
Feb 21 07:33:48 <mane>	i am unable to tell why am i being hit but i have no doubts that i'm beiung hit
Feb 21 07:33:55 *	nullvalue recognises this behaviour from else where
Feb 21 07:34:53 <mane>	i always prefered creation over destruction
Feb 21 07:35:23 <mane>	i dont hang out with vandals
Feb 21 07:35:45 <mane>	they fill urges to break everything around
Feb 21 07:35:52 <mane>	i never knew why
Feb 21 07:36:08 <mane>	its stronger than them
Feb 21 07:37:13 <mane>	also, i consequently ignore the voices since i got crazy
Feb 21 07:37:20 <mane>	its a virtue
Feb 21 07:37:31 <mane>	i'm a man you can rely one
Feb 21 07:41:39 <mane>	and again, no one notices that ever
Feb 21 07:41:44 <mane>	so unfair
Feb 21 07:43:47 <mane>	also the current state of things, i still have no kangarooo
Feb 21 07:47:42 <nullvalue>	are you gonna eat a kangaroo
Feb 21 07:47:44 <nullvalue>	?
Feb 21 07:47:55 <mane>	i don't feed on plush
Feb 21 07:48:09 <nullvalue>	aah plushies
Feb 21 07:48:13 <mane>	the canguroo has the task to be as awesome as possible
Feb 21 07:48:18 <nullvalue>	i thought the real deal
Feb 21 07:48:45 <mane>	that's his role in my part of reality
Feb 21 07:49:13 <mane>	and i will share it anyone i meet
Feb 21 07:49:27 <nullvalue>	imma just head on over here and let you vent....k
Feb 21 07:49:32 <mane>	because all must know how awesome he is
Feb 21 07:57:11 <mane>	and you better don't take me for a salfish guy
Feb 21 07:57:25 <mane>	i a
Feb 21 07:57:34 <mane>	i enjoy sharing anything
Feb 21 07:57:49 <mane>	i like to make a gift
Feb 21 07:58:09 <mane>	it feels good
Feb 21 07:58:46 <mane>	so i just do it to feel fantastic
Feb 21 07:59:38 <mane>	however i hate spending money
Feb 21 08:00:15 <mane>	so i don't directly buy gifts
Feb 21 08:00:38 <mane>	igift something that has a non material value
Feb 21 08:01:03 <mane>	those gifts feel the best
Feb 21 08:01:58 <mane>	buying a gift 30 minutes before gifting it to someone feels like a bribe
Feb 21 08:02:12 <mane>	it's not right
Feb 21 08:03:12 <mane>	and you know me now more so you know how to understand my actions, you can rely n me more
Feb 21 08:04:34 <mane>	that for sure will build a beautifull friendship
Feb 21 08:10:42 <mane>	some understand me well
Feb 21 08:10:53 <mane>	those are the best i get along with
Feb 21 08:11:15 <mane>	but this takes a bit intelect
Feb 21 08:11:24 <mane>	i'm not that simple
Feb 21 08:12:04 <mane>	pretty alien and not like anyone else
Feb 21 08:12:25 <mane>	so i'm always like a man from abroad
Feb 21 08:13:28 <mane>	but people of intelect can actually make a conversation with me
Feb 21 08:13:52 <mane>	and know me
Feb 21 08:14:10 <mane>	and look beyond my image of a crazy bum
Feb 21 08:15:02 <mane>	and i bget along with those the best
Feb 21 08:15:38 <mane>	which is not being recieved too well
Feb 21 08:16:05 <mane>	because how this bum dares to tok to that guy
Feb 21 08:16:08 <mane>	cant be
Feb 21 08:17:14 <mane>	you know for some thing i appear like a genius
Feb 21 08:17:59 <mane>	but those are those who have biggest faith in me
Feb 21 08:19:37 <mane>	and much smarter agreed to decide that my idiocy is very deep and one of a kind
Feb 21 08:20:23 <mane>	its a material for a doctorate
Feb 21 08:20:38 <mane>	i kinda take that probable
Feb 21 08:21:04 <mane>	but i don't blindly believe that
Feb 21 08:33:05 <mlu>	mane: can we please leave the drama out of networking?
Feb 21 08:36:26 <nullvalue>	am frankly surprised no one gave it the boot
Feb 21 08:36:35 <nullvalue>	why?? double standards
Feb 21 08:37:18 <cousin_luigi>	Double stack too?
Feb 21 08:37:33 <nullvalue>	multiple staked
Feb 21 08:45:33 <mane>	i never will forget the coolest androids i've seen in my life
Feb 21 08:45:36 <mane>	kinky
Feb 21 08:45:50 <mane>	worth getting birth
Feb 21 08:46:26 <mane>	if not my apt eye i'd be convinced they're human
Feb 21 08:46:38 <mane>	just like everyone else
Feb 21 08:47:36 <mane>	of course everyone calls me crazy so no one will be aware
Feb 21 08:47:54 <mane>	so there is no issue
Feb 21 08:49:05 <mane>	my meaningless posission sometimes saves me some trouble
Feb 21 08:49:35 <mane>	it is not completly useless
Feb 21 08:49:40 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to mlu
Feb 21 08:50:00 *	mlu has kicked mane from #networking (please stop spewing nonsense)
Feb 21 08:50:10 *	mlu removes channel operator status from mlu
Feb 21 09:09:09 <eirirs>	Thuryn: thanks for good answer
Feb 21 09:09:47 <eirirs>	Looks like Palo Alto is using IPFIX
Feb 21 09:27:21 <Disconsented>	Ayy got IPv6 working
Feb 21 09:27:39 <mlu>	Disconsented: glorious!
Feb 21 09:27:42 <Disconsented>	Well I can ping out at least
Feb 21 09:27:53 <mlu>	Disconsented: does https://www6.google.com work?
Feb 21 09:28:01 <Disconsented>	404 :|
Feb 21 09:28:58 <mlu>	https://test-ipv6.com/ -> status?
Feb 21 09:29:15 <Disconsented>	Also nada
Feb 21 09:29:19 <Disconsented>	back to it then >_>
Feb 21 09:29:25 <mlu>	hmm, dang, looks like google changed it up
Feb 21 09:29:36 <mlu>	Disconsented: maybe your browser is just fussy
Feb 21 09:29:47 <mlu>	Disconsented: HE.net actually has an ipv6 certification fun thingy
Feb 21 09:30:31 <Disconsented>	https://paste.disconsented.com/upload/bmV9Ed
Feb 21 09:31:14 <Disconsented>	I like how... vintage hurricane electrics site is
Feb 21 09:31:35 <mlu>	Disconsented: oh yeah, they've been around for a while :)
Feb 21 09:32:08 <mlu>	Disconsented: https://ip6.me/ -> did it detect your external IPv6 address?
Feb 21 09:32:28 <Disconsented>	Nah shows my V4
Feb 21 09:32:32 <mlu>	:(
Feb 21 09:32:38 <mlu>	hmm, maybe you're using 6in4
Feb 21 09:33:20 <eirirs>	or your computer are preferring ipv4 over ipv6
Feb 21 09:33:42 <mlu>	Disconsented: do you know how you're doing IPv6? i.e. are you using DHCPv6-PD on your router and then having your devices get assignemnts via radvd?
Feb 21 09:33:58 <eirirs>	what do ipconfig on your computer say? any ipv6 address that are not FE80 ? 
Feb 21 09:34:17 <nullvalue>	new IPv6, ping who dis?
Feb 21 09:34:18 <Disconsented>	 DHCPv6-PD from my ISP yeah
Feb 21 09:34:41 <dminuoso>	Disconsented: What was it?
Feb 21 09:34:45 <Disconsented>	I do have an IPv6 address from my subnet
Feb 21 09:34:59 <mlu>	what's interesting is that it's a routed block this time :)
Feb 21 09:35:21 <Disconsented>	Added the prefix into addresses with the advertise flag
Feb 21 09:35:25 <mlu>	the big question is: is all the IPv6 routing over IPv6 and all the IPv4 routing over IPv4?
Feb 21 09:35:28 <Disconsented>	Not sure what that actually translates to
Feb 21 09:35:36 <dminuoso>	Disconsented: Sorry, can you rephrase that? Not quite sure what that means.
Feb 21 09:35:54 <Disconsented>	Not sure how to explain it, don't want screenshot it either >_>
Feb 21 09:36:03 <mlu>	Disconsented: with SLAAC, your machine literally takes your mac address and glues it to the end of the advertised IPv6 prefix (basically)
Feb 21 09:36:31 <dminuoso>	Not quite sure what "advertise flag" means here, or what "Adding a prefix into addresses" means.
Feb 21 09:36:45 <dminuoso>	But anyway, if you dont want to share details thats fine. Just curious, thats all.
Feb 21 09:37:13 <Disconsented>	I can share the config but I just don't know what words to pick is all
Feb 21 09:39:03 <mlu>	Disconsented: for example, my ISP delegated me the prefix 2607:f598:b93a:321/64, so that's what my router advertised
Feb 21 09:39:35 <mlu>	Disconsented: then my system picked that up and, using SLAAC, assigned an IPv6 address of 2607:f598:b93a:321:7d77:e5c4:eff9:b3a3
Feb 21 09:39:40 <Disconsented>	https://paste.disconsented.com/upload/b28LJe
Feb 21 09:39:43 <Disconsented>	That's the config
Feb 21 09:39:43 <dminuoso>	mlu: They only hand you a /64 for delegation? Which ASN is that, so I can send some poop-in-a-bag to their network engineers.
Feb 21 09:39:58 <nullvalue>	so that would mean router address is 2607:f598:b93a:: <-router ??
Feb 21 09:40:01 <mlu>	dminuoso: well, I only asked for a /64
Feb 21 09:40:09 <mlu>	dminuoso: they will do up to a /60 if I request one
Feb 21 09:40:14 <dminuoso>	Oh boy.
Feb 21 09:40:25 <dminuoso>	I might have to send two poops-in-a-bag.
Feb 21 09:40:39 <dminuoso>	Someone is scared of waste there.
Feb 21 09:41:07 <mlu>	dminuoso: my other choice of ISP refused to do larger than /64 and also charged twice as much as my current one
Feb 21 09:41:23 <dminuoso>	With us you get a /48 without having to ask for it.
Feb 21 09:41:28 <mlu>	dminuoso: come to the US and save us :P
Feb 21 09:41:29 <dminuoso>	Come move to wolfsburg!
Feb 21 09:41:48 <mlu>	you can move back when we fire you for no reason at all ;)
Feb 21 09:41:54 <dminuoso>	Haha
Feb 21 09:42:11 <mlu>	hmm, wolfsburg -- that's where the BMWs are made?
Feb 21 09:42:31 <dminuoso>	Lets just say yes. BMW, VW, whats the difference.
Feb 21 09:42:40 <dminuoso>	They're all German to you, aren't they.
Feb 21 09:42:51 <nullvalue>	aah, bmw the only folks who post their code on github
Feb 21 09:42:59 <dminuoso>	nullvalue: Great, isn't it?
Feb 21 09:43:04 <nullvalue>	it is
Feb 21 09:43:04 <dminuoso>	We value open source, whether its intentional or not.
Feb 21 09:43:16 <mlu>	dminuoso: they do make a differnece although I could never remember which one goes where
Feb 21 09:43:17 <nullvalue>	we do, we do
Feb 21 09:43:43 <dminuoso>	mlu: Yeah so the biggest difference is, engineers for BMW get to drink beer during lunch while engineers for VW do not.
Feb 21 09:44:03 <mlu>	in general: BMW = I want a fun car, Audi = I want a stylish car, VW = I want a cheap car, Benz = I want a pretty car
Feb 21 09:44:15 <dminuoso>	VW does not make cheap cars.
Feb 21 09:44:22 <nullvalue>	Benz in pwettty....
Feb 21 09:44:22 <mlu>	s/cheap/affordable
Feb 21 09:44:33 <dminuoso>	Skoda is when you want VW-but-in-affordable.
Feb 21 09:44:39 <dminuoso>	Mostly same platform and same parts.
Feb 21 09:44:39 <nullvalue>	i like the AMG gt series
Feb 21 09:45:03 <nullvalue>	they look so classy
Feb 21 09:45:16 <dminuoso>	 (Not quite sure whether Skoda is even known in the US)
Feb 21 09:45:38 <mlu>	ah, Wolfsburg is VW :D
Feb 21 09:45:41 <dminuoso>	Yeah.
Feb 21 09:46:05 <mlu>	shared sounds :)
Feb 21 09:46:18 *	mlu wonders if MB is based out of Munich
Feb 21 09:46:25 <dminuoso>	What is MB?
Feb 21 09:46:30 <mlu>	Benz
Feb 21 09:46:44 <dminuoso>	Nope, their HQ is in Stuttgart.
Feb 21 09:47:21 <dminuoso>	Audi is located in Ingolstadt, BMW in Munich.
Feb 21 09:47:26 <mlu>	:)
Feb 21 09:47:43 <mlu>	I wonder if Porsche has their own HQ or if it's just lumped with Audi
Feb 21 09:48:02 <dminuoso>	Well, I mean it depends on your perspective.
Feb 21 09:48:05 <nullvalue>	*sigh* someday MB some day , imma own one of your AMG GT's
Feb 21 09:48:12 <dminuoso>	Porsche, like Audi or Skoda all belong to the Volkswagen Group.
Feb 21 09:48:23 <dminuoso>	Formally Porsche is headquartered in Stuttgart.
Feb 21 09:48:29 <dminuoso>	But the real overlords are in Wolfsburg.
Feb 21 09:48:31 <mdogg>	Porsche is in Stuttgart
Feb 21 09:48:56 <mlu>	woof woof
Feb 21 09:49:59 <dminuoso>	(VW Group owns over 50% of voting rights of Porsche SE)
Feb 21 09:50:04 <mdogg>	Actually, I think Volkswagen owns Audi and Porsche now.  
Feb 21 09:50:10 <dminuoso>	They do.
Feb 21 09:50:11 <mdogg>	Yeah
Feb 21 09:50:28 <dminuoso>	Or well rather, no its the other way around.
Feb 21 09:50:36 <mlu>	one big group
Feb 21 09:50:43 <dminuoso>	Porsche SE is the holding of Volkswagen Group. Ah it was that way around
Feb 21 09:50:48 *	mlu wonders if there are anti-trust laws in Germany
Feb 21 09:50:51 <dminuoso>	Its one big convoluted mess.
Feb 21 09:51:07 <dminuoso>	mlu: There are, they just dont apply to German car manufacturers.
Feb 21 09:51:33 <mlu>	dminuoso: probably not yet because there's currently health competition among the big thre?
Feb 21 09:52:14 <dminuoso>	mlu: Well, for starters Lower Saxony (one of our states) has over 10% equity in Volkswagen.
Feb 21 09:52:29 <dminuoso>	They're a huge employer, because VW actually builds many vehicles in Germany.
Feb 21 09:52:44 <dminuoso>	Politics has little interest in cutting into their own flesh.
Feb 21 09:52:48 <mlu>	the VWs we see here in the states are all from Germany
Feb 21 09:53:31 <mdogg>	It's not really that convoluted.  Ford is stll the parent company for several brands like Jaguar, Aston Martin, Rover, and a few others, aren't they? 
Feb 21 09:53:48 <mlu>	the BMWs -- if it's a SUV, it's built in the US, but if it's anything else (i.e. sedan/wagon), it comes straight from Germany
Feb 21 09:53:56 <mdogg>	VW is the parent company and Audi and Porsche are subsidiaries.  
Feb 21 09:54:08 <dminuoso>	mlu: Some VWs are also made in the US. The Atlas and the ID.4 are produced locally overseas.
Feb 21 09:54:15 <dminuoso>	I mean there's factories in several places
Feb 21 09:54:24 <dminuoso>	But the ID.4 you buy in the US was probably made in the US.
Feb 21 09:55:19 *	mlu checks
Feb 21 09:55:55 <dminuoso>	(The Atlas is also pretty much an American only product, so there's that too)
Feb 21 09:55:59 <mdogg>	I've never cared for any BMW SUV, and the only Mercedes Benz SUV I think is cool is the G-Wagen, though I would never buy one.
Feb 21 09:56:05 <dminuoso>	Maybe China too, not sure.
Feb 21 09:57:11 <dminuoso>	And Golf, its probably hard to say. There's factories for that all over the world.
Feb 21 09:57:42 <mdogg>	As far as SUV's go, my favorite has always been a Range Rover.  I've never owned one but I've had a couple of friends who have and I think they're awesome.
Feb 21 09:58:11 <mlu>	have a few friends that are huge fans
Feb 21 09:58:14 <dminuoso>	China, Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico, Wolfsburg, Zwickau, 
Feb 21 09:58:26 <mlu>	last car decision, it was between a BMW 328d and a Jaguar XF that I was deciding between
Feb 21 09:58:29 <mdogg>	Oh, a proper Range Rover I mean - not the "Sport" model.  
Feb 21 09:58:31 <dminuoso>	If I had to guess, that Mexico is a far more likely place to build cars for the US than Germany for two reasons.
Feb 21 09:58:46 <mlu>	Mexico has dirt cheap labor
Feb 21 09:58:53 <dminuoso>	a) better profit margins because German employes are well compensated, and transport cost.
Feb 21 09:59:11 <mlu>	and NAFTA helps a lot with the taxes
Feb 21 09:59:19 <dminuoso>	The only question is whether Volkswagen is able to have the same quality control in Mexico.
Feb 21 09:59:21 <mdogg>	But unfortunately the US has tariffs.
Feb 21 09:59:31 <dminuoso>	If they do, whats the difference whether it was welded together in Mexico or Germany.
Feb 21 09:59:48 <mlu>	the tariffs are bad enough that Euro Delivery is a thing
Feb 21 10:00:21 <dminuoso>	Tariffs is such a weird thing, I really dont get how people could ever be sold on the idea, that tariffs are paid by the overseas company or country.
Feb 21 10:00:21 <mdogg>	The German auto manufactures are usually very meticulous about ensuring quality standards are maintained regardless of manufacturing location.  
Feb 21 10:00:35 <mlu>	it's protectionism
Feb 21 10:00:45 <dminuoso>	mlu: I get what they do, but they dont cause companies or countries to pay for them.
Feb 21 10:00:51 <dminuoso>	They cause your own population to pay for them.
Feb 21 10:01:07 <dminuoso>	Companies are not stupid, they are in for the money. If you put tariffs on me, I will include them in the sales price.
Feb 21 10:01:29 <dminuoso>	So the price increase is what decreases demand.
Feb 21 10:01:33 <mlu>	makes it harder to compete
Feb 21 10:01:51 <dminuoso>	Sure. Im just saying I dont get how you can sell people on the idea that you end up "raking in money from other countries or foreign companies"
Feb 21 10:02:02 <dminuoso>	like 45 did.
Feb 21 10:02:07 <mdogg>	The concept of tariffs are completely at odds with the idea of free enterprise and a open global economy.  
Feb 21 10:02:21 <mlu>	I personally see them as just encouraging you to buy local, ultimately
Feb 21 10:02:33 <mlu>	but that depends on the existence of a healthy local industry
Feb 21 10:02:37 <mlu>	for cars, I think the US does in fact have one
Feb 21 10:02:46 <mlu>	but for electronics, uh oh
Feb 21 10:03:00 <mdogg>	Buy local even if the quality isn't as good, because it's artificially slightly less expensive. 
Feb 21 10:03:35 <dminuoso>	mlu: Oh, the US has a really good shaped headquarters. From what I hear, Detroit is a lovely, vibrant, wealthy and good place to be in.
Feb 21 10:03:38 *	mlu points at the Ford Focus / Dodge Charger and laughs
Feb 21 10:03:47 <dminuoso>	For certain types of coyotes I mean.,
Feb 21 10:04:14 <mlu>	the cars are fine, but at the end of the day, the German cars are just that much better :P
Feb 21 10:04:19 <dminuoso>	But seriously, Detroit used to be was what Wolfsburg or Ingolstadt is to Germany today.
Feb 21 10:04:58 <mlu>	yep, have a few friends that were in that area
Feb 21 10:05:15 <mdogg>	dminuoso: I lived in Detroit for a few years, but the Detroit I lived in was in Michigan which was much different than the city you're describing.   
Feb 21 10:05:27 <mlu>	Detroit had its heyday in the 60s
Feb 21 10:05:44 <mdogg>	Actually, I would much rather live in Detroit than Chicago.  Hands down.
Feb 21 10:06:00 <mdogg>	And the state of Michigan is really very beautiful in the spring and summer.
Feb 21 10:06:22 <dminuoso>	Isn't Detroit on the top ten cities by crime rates nowadays?
Feb 21 10:06:38 <mdogg>	Probably but I will bet that Chicago is worse.
Feb 21 10:06:40 <dminuoso>	For what its worth, we have a similar thing in Germany.
Feb 21 10:06:44 <mlu>	I actually point to the Japanese manufacturers for the downfall of Detroit
Feb 21 10:06:59 <synthmeat>	is everything around the lakes collapsing?
Feb 21 10:07:07 <mlu>	it has been for a while
Feb 21 10:07:10 <dminuoso>	For us its the Ruhrpott (Bochum and Duisburg in particular), which is an extremely densely populated region that was fed by mining.
Feb 21 10:07:16 <dminuoso>	Nowadays, its desolated wasteland.
Feb 21 10:07:25 <mdogg>	Detroit wasn't able to evolve from what was happening to the auto industry beginning in the 1970's.  
Feb 21 10:07:25 <mlu>	we have a name for that region of the US: Rust Belt
Feb 21 10:07:25 <dminuoso>	Because all mining had stopped extremely suddenly
Feb 21 10:08:30 <synthmeat>	mlu: ah. thank you, never made that connection in my head. yeah, the industrial hub. guess you need a lot of non-salty water to cool shit down
Feb 21 10:09:24 <mdogg>	"Nobody's going to buy these small little Honda CVCC hatchbacks with 4-cylinder engines (which have the same horsepower output as our V-8).  Who cares if they come standard with an AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, etc."
Feb 21 10:10:06 <mlu>	my dad drives a Nissan Altima /w CVT :(
Feb 21 10:10:58 *	synthmeat is buying his first car in a few months. 2023, mazda 3, sedan, manual.
Feb 21 10:11:29 <mdogg>	It amazes me how little power and torque American engine manufactures could get out of their motors.  V-8 engines that produce less than 100HP. 
Feb 21 10:11:37 <synthmeat>	there's basically no budget non-hybrids to buy in europe :/
Feb 21 10:11:59 <Disconsented>	Interesting, my temporary IPv6 is marked as reachable but not my permanent one 
Feb 21 10:12:18 <mdogg>	Your temporary one?  
Feb 21 10:12:24 <Disconsented>	I presume this is an issue
Feb 21 10:12:35 <mlu>	the prefix is supposed to last a while
Feb 21 10:12:37 <mdogg>	ohh - scrolling back
Feb 21 10:13:13 <mdogg>	Hey - cool domain and pastebin, Disconsented.
Feb 21 10:13:24 <Disconsented>	Cheers
Feb 21 10:13:37 <mdogg>	DiscoPaste.
Feb 21 10:13:43 <Disconsented>	Eh Ill work out the rest tomorrow
Feb 21 10:13:48 <mdogg>	Can anyone use that?
Feb 21 10:13:53 <mlu>	synthmeat: ZF8 is a decent automatic transmission :)
Feb 21 10:14:10 *	mlu recommends diesel
Feb 21 10:14:12 <Disconsented>	Yep mdogg but no guarantee I wont do things to other pastes there ;)
Feb 21 10:14:18 <Disconsented>	Might have to brave ##mikrotik tomorrow
Feb 21 10:14:29 <synthmeat>	mlu: skyactiv-x kinda works like a diesel
Feb 21 10:14:40 *	Disconsented waves
Feb 21 10:14:46 <mlu>	laters Disco
Feb 21 10:14:55 <mlu>	synthmeat: don't they have a diesel Mazda3 there?
Feb 21 10:15:07 <synthmeat>	no, definitely not
Feb 21 10:15:33 <synthmeat>	i'm rushing to buy basically anything new that isn't hybrid, so i can just not worry about anything for, dunno, 2 decades
Feb 21 10:15:58 <mdogg>	I usually use https://paste.opensuse.org but when they upgraded the site they forced the 'raw' URL to be hella long.  I generally prefer to share the raw URL because I find it nicer to look at. 
Feb 21 10:16:03 <synthmeat>	even this thing is $35k, and its not top of the line
Feb 21 10:16:24 <mdogg>	But I can't do that on openSUSE's pastebin anymore without dumping a gigantic URL in the channel.
Feb 21 10:19:25 *	synthmeat just puts stuff on github as private gist
Feb 21 10:22:43 <mlu>	synthmeat: I generally prefer to buy used to avoid the depreciation
Feb 21 10:22:52 <mdogg>	^ me too.
Feb 21 10:23:16 <mlu>	and this is more true than ever if you fear the costs of a dead battery pack / too much complexity
Feb 21 10:23:17 <synthmeat>	well, my goal is to buy and drive it until it falls apart, so that's unimportant
Feb 21 10:23:23 <mdogg>	Disconsented: Do you have your own (owned) modem and your own separate router?
Feb 21 10:23:29 <mlu>	synthmeat: hey, save $20k :)
Feb 21 10:23:49 <mdogg>	Oh, he might be gone for the night.
Feb 21 10:23:59 <mlu>	synthmeat: i.e. I drive a '14 328d -- bought it for $12k in 2021 -- few major replacements later, it's running like a champ
Feb 21 10:24:21 <mlu>	mdogg: nah, just for the afternoon -- he's in NZ
Feb 21 10:24:42 <mdogg>	Ah, the government controls Internet access there?
Feb 21 10:24:57 <mdogg>	It's a public utility?
Feb 21 10:25:03 *	mlu shrugs
Feb 21 10:26:26 <mdogg>	Well, I'm just trying to understand because i inferred from your comment that it is not possible to purchase your own modem and set it up to connect.   
Feb 21 10:26:55 <mlu>	most AUS/NZ ISPxs require you to use their equipment
Feb 21 10:26:56 <mdogg>	OH, I misread what you wrote bro.  SOrry.
Feb 21 10:27:15 <mlu>	it's the land of evil ISPs
Feb 21 10:27:17 <mdogg>	You were talking about him taking a break for the afternoon.  
Feb 21 10:27:51 <mdogg>	ohh ok.  I know in the U.K. the government will block certain websites/IP addresses, too.  I guess it's the same way down under.
Feb 21 10:29:05 <mdogg>	Well, even if he doesn't have his own modem I'll ask him tomorrow if his router is his own vs. a modem/router combo thing.
Feb 21 10:30:30 <mlu>	here in the US, we just seize domain names :P

Feb 21 10:32:57 <mdogg>	My folks have Comcast and they have some bundle package which includes TV, phone, and Internet.  Their modem is one of those modem/router combos.  I bought them an ASUS wireless router years ago so when the installer came I asked him to put the modem into bridge-mode so I could have them continue using it.  
Feb 21 10:33:09 <mdogg>	I don't know why but the settings/options in those combination modem/router deals are pretty sparse compared to pretty much any standard router.
Feb 21 10:33:31 <mlu>	ah, those Technicolor devices
Feb 21 10:33:46 <mlu>	mdogg: there's an advanced mode -- have you peaked?
Feb 21 10:33:58 <mlu>	they try to hide it because the average user is just gonna break stuff
Feb 21 10:34:06 <mdogg>	I think I'm feeling something.
Feb 21 10:34:11 <mdogg>	Oh
Feb 21 10:36:23 <mdogg>	Well, they already had the router and I already had everything configured in it from before (with their previous ISP) so if I'm honest, I wasn't interested in even looking at the settings in Comcast's modem/router.
Feb 21 10:36:40 <mlu>	the modem firmware = :(
Feb 21 10:36:48 <mlu>	and the thing is, the modem itself has to kind of act like a rouiter anyways

Feb 21 10:39:29 <mdogg>	Actually now I want to login to my modem.
Feb 21 10:40:53 <mdogg>	Nighthawk CM1200
Feb 21 10:45:35 <mdogg>	Nice - https://192.168.100.1/ is the default URL
Feb 21 10:47:44 <mdogg>	What's cool is the firmware for the modem is presented the exact same way the R9000 router is presented.  I like that.
Feb 21 10:48:46 <mdogg>	Looks like Comcast is responsible for pushing new firmware to the device - nothing for me to update.
Feb 21 10:49:10 <mdogg>	I'll check my folks' modem next time I go over there but I reckon it is going to be the same thing.
Feb 21 10:50:07 <mdogg>	I'm glad you brought this up, mlu.  I haven't logged into the modem in years.
Feb 21 10:50:23 <Reventlov>	Hey.
Feb 21 10:50:30 <mdogg>	..is for horses.
Feb 21 10:51:03 <Reventlov>	On Linux, can I connect a bridge in a given network namespace A to interfaces in a network namespace B without adding other interfaces (such as veth) into the network namespaces A ?
Feb 21 10:53:26 <mdogg>	Not really..  You would typically use a pair of virtual Ethernet interfaces to create a connection between namespaces.  One end of the veth pair resides in namespace A, connected to the bridge, while the other end resides in namespace B and can be connected to the interface you want.
Feb 21 11:39:44 <Harm133>	Hey guys, I'm trying to create a RR bond directly from host to host. I have 2 network interfaces on both hosts and want to connect them directly (without a switch) would this be doable?
Feb 21 11:41:13 <xand>	yes it should work
Feb 21 11:43:28 <Harm133>	it seems my NICs keep disconnecting :(
Feb 21 11:47:51 <Inline>	i have a bridge which i am routing arp from wlan0 via parprouted, however with my previous setup i was gettings disconnects on wifi and it was as if the bridge took over the connections
Feb 21 11:48:05 <Inline>	why might that happen ?
Feb 21 11:48:07 <Inline>	loops ?
Feb 21 12:30:17 <dminuoso>	Harm133: On a side note, if you want RR you should at least make sure you have layer 3+4 hashing (or be intimitaely aware of the out-of-order consequences)
Feb 21 12:33:24 <mdogg>	Harm133: RR bonds are passive optical components.  If you meant something like establishing a direct link using the network interfaces, you would create a point-to-pint network with a crossover cable or use dedicated fiberoptic transceivers.  Then you can configure both interfaces for the same subnet and disable any other network interfaces on the hosts.
Feb 21 12:34:30 <mdogg>	Bes ure that your firewall rules are setup properly for the new link.
Feb 21 12:41:48 <mdogg>	Inline: The Wi-Fi interface might not be designed to handle the additional overhead of bridging and routing, leading to instability.  You might try reducing the frequency of ARP announcements, or disabling them completely by adjusting them in ssyctlsettings.  You could also try setting up a separate routing table for your wireless network which may help alleviate some of the issues.  
Feb 21 12:44:14 <mdogg>	It could also be just plain 'ol interference.  Try putting the antenna on the opposite side of the room.  
Feb 21 12:44:52 <mdogg>	I reckon that it's just being asked to do too much.
Feb 21 12:49:42 <machinehum>	Can anyone tell me why these pings are not working? https://pastebin.com/raw/GX4U9LwP
Feb 21 12:50:11 <machinehum>	I'm still stuck on this aircrack thing, but not I'm going deeper and trying to learn more about networking
Feb 21 12:51:55 <djph>	machinehum: because your ping commands make no sense.
Feb 21 12:53:26 <machinehum>	djph: Okay, highly likely
Feb 21 12:54:32 <machinehum>	I'm trying to understand how one subnet can reach another subnet, meaning if I have something accessing a gateway at say 192.168.1.1, how this can forward traffic to a gateway at 192.168.2.1
Feb 21 12:57:49 <djph>	via a router.
Feb 21 12:58:48 <djph>	the router decapsulates the L3 packet from the L2 frame, checks its routing table, re-encapsulates the packet in a new frame, and sends the data on its way
Feb 21 12:59:14 <djph>	Note that if the router is on a network edge (e.g. your home to the internet), it may also apply NAT
Feb 21 13:01:58 <mdogg>	machinehum: Try specifying the source device by IP rather than by name.  ping -c4 -I 192.168.1.104 192.168.99.2
Feb 21 13:02:42 <mdogg>	oh, I added -c4 just to stop it after 4 ping requests.
Feb 21 13:07:23 <mdogg>	machinehum: Here is my output -> https://paste.disconsented.com/raw/bkXE5d
Feb 21 13:07:43 <Inline>	ok, thank you mdogg
Feb 21 13:07:55 <Inline>	i suppose i have to learn about setting up routing tables
Feb 21 13:08:28 <Inline>	welp, on slip, when i use qemu without a dedicated net, it all works, and it's via the same MAC even and with the same ip
Feb 21 13:08:51 <Inline>	so there must be some sane way todo it like that, just a little different
Feb 21 13:09:42 <Inline>	however the laptop gets hot in either case, after a while it stops to heat tho, say after 1-2 hours
Feb 21 13:10:13 <mdogg>	.back
Feb 21 13:10:25 <Inline>	it gets hot even when all vms are idle, just starting them suffices
Feb 21 13:10:30 <mdogg>	It stops heating or it "stops" because it's too hot?
Feb 21 13:10:53 <Inline>	i don't think it stops, the vms are still there and functional after it stops heating
Feb 21 13:11:00 <Inline>	the laptop just cools down
Feb 21 13:11:08 <Inline>	no idea why it initially heats up that much
Feb 21 13:11:11 <Inline>	is it caching ?
Feb 21 13:11:37 <mdogg>	Oh..  Where is the laptop physically?  It isn't seated on something like a pillow or a bed, is it? 
Feb 21 13:11:47 <Inline>	no, it's not
Feb 21 13:11:55 <mdogg>	Ok.  Had to ask..  
Feb 21 13:11:59 <Inline>	it sits on a table plane, which is cold
Feb 21 13:15:37 <mdogg>	I'm not sure whether the issue you're having with it getting hot initially has anything to do with the probmel you're having but it is a good idea to open it up every couple of months and vacuum/blow any excess dust out of it and away from the fans.  Also, while it's open ensure the fans still work.  SOmetimes a fan will go out and you won't even know it.
Feb 21 13:15:46 <mdogg>	..until something burns up..
Feb 21 13:17:26 <Inline>	while under load it might get overtly hot, as in really warming my knees etc..
Feb 21 13:17:55 <Inline>	anyway, are there laptop wifi cards which handle virtual networking better ?
Feb 21 13:18:13 <machinehum>	djph: Yeah I see, in a normal network, I'm trying to do this on one device
Feb 21 13:18:22 <Inline>	this one does only wifi and it's not bridgeable
Feb 21 13:18:37 <machinehum>	mdogg: Doesn't seem to work, I think there's something wrong with my config
Feb 21 13:19:49 <mdogg>	I'm gonna get out of here for a bit.  Let us know how it goes, especially if you find a resolution.  I like it when people come back and post what ultimately resolved the issue.  I think most people apprecaite that and we don't get it all too often.  
Feb 21 13:20:20 <sem>	I have a few ioT things. Right now they're devices on the main home LAN like anything else. Is the best practice to put them all on a limited VLAN, or put each one in isolation from each other one, it something else
Feb 21 13:21:22 <mdogg>	machinehum: You should try doing the inverse as well:  ping -c4 -I 192.168.99.2 192.168.1.104
Feb 21 13:21:41 <machinehum>	nop
Feb 21 13:22:21 <mdogg>	My output -> https://paste.disconsented.com/raw/aMvJAb
Feb 21 13:22:39 <mdogg>	Yeah, something ain't right.
Feb 21 13:23:49 <mdogg>	"Have you tried powering it off and back on again?"  --The IT Crowd
Feb 21 13:23:55 <machinehum>	lol
Feb 21 13:25:28 <mdogg>	I'll be back in a ittle while-- bonne chance!
Feb 21 13:29:21 <djph>	machinehum: "on one device" doesn't work like that.
Feb 21 13:30:08 <machinehum>	I see
Feb 21 13:51:37 <Reventlov>	Another question : is there anything to do to have cisco switch bounce back ARP requests on the same port they came through ? (hairpin)
Feb 21 13:52:24 <djph>	Reventlov: that would be bad.
Feb 21 13:52:31 <Reventlov>	why ?
Feb 21 13:53:15 <nullvalue>	what are the main layer 2 protocols one needs to familiarize with?
Feb 21 13:53:55 <djph>	Reventlov: Well, if I have PC_A on a port ARP'ing for some host ... sending the ARP back to the originating host is somewhat stupid.
Feb 21 13:54:16 <Reventlov>	originating host, yes, originating port, not really (think VMs, …)
Feb 21 13:54:39 <djph>	Reventlov: yo uliterally asked to have the switch "bounce the ARP request on the same port"
Feb 21 13:54:52 <Reventlov>	yes, same port.
Feb 21 13:55:05 <needle>	 nullvalue: depends on the given task, the amount of L2 nodes, the distances and the amount of traffic.
Feb 21 13:55:09 <Reventlov>	but I do have multiple ""hosts"" connected to that port (VMs)
Feb 21 13:55:14 <djph>	Is the VM on the same subnet?
Feb 21 13:55:23 <djph>	*subnet / VLAN
Feb 21 13:55:25 <needle>	nullvalue: generally ethernet only in LAN. for L2
Feb 21 13:55:45 <Reventlov>	yes, but as I use macvtap interfaces in VEPA mode, the traffic leaves to the external switch anyway ( https://access.redhat.com/documentation/fr-fr/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_deployment_and_administration_guide/sect-virtual_networking-directly_attaching_to_physical_interface )
Feb 21 13:55:46 <nullvalue>	ok
Feb 21 13:56:35 <nullvalue>	ill read more about it and figure stuff out
Feb 21 13:56:49 <nullvalue>	its for class so reading is a must
Feb 21 13:57:08 <needle>	nullvalue: further reading about L2 and its protocols https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer
Feb 21 13:57:31 <needle>	but that is more sophisticated and more complex L2 solutions or for different areas.
Feb 21 13:57:32 <nullvalue>	thnx
Feb 21 14:11:15 <machinehum>	Oh, I'm starting to think what I'm trying to do is impossible.
Feb 21 14:13:34 <noneoftheabove>	that's my usual conclusion
Feb 21 14:14:04 <MacGyver>	machinehum: At no point you seem to have told us what you are trying to do.
Feb 21 14:14:25 <MacGyver>	machinehum: There's some hints re: "trying to do this on one device".
Feb 21 14:14:45 <machinehum>	MacGyver: Sorry lol https://old.reddit.com/r/openwrt/comments/1avfgly/evil_twin_ap/
Feb 21 14:16:02 <MacGyver>	machinehum: The person telling you to bridge those interfaces is wrong, that likely won't work.
Feb 21 14:17:50 <noneoftheabove>	openwrt has a client mode, no?
Feb 21 14:20:41 <MacGyver>	machinehum: The short answer is "what you're trying to do is absolutely possible".
Feb 21 14:22:43 <needle>	nullvalue: Not sure if it might help you, but at some point probably yes. on L3 there is _only_ IP. https://educatedguesswork.org/img/ip-waist-deering.png The layers below and above have many protocols. L3 has only IP.
Feb 21 14:25:10 <MacGyver>	machinehum: Ignoring the evil twin part for a second, you're just trying to set up a WiFi access point and forwarding all traffic to an upstream access point. You might *not* be able to reuse the DHCP server of the upstream network in the downstream network, and you will almost certainly have to use network address translation here because you can't make the upstream network aware that your
Feb 21 14:25:12 <MacGyver>	machine is a router.
Feb 21 14:25:53 <MacGyver>	machinehum: So steps are, set up a DHCP server for your access point, and set up masquerading.
Feb 21 14:26:26 <nullvalue>	ill read into it thanks needle
Feb 21 14:28:51 <nullvalue>	just dloaded Andrew Tanenbuams "computer networks" 5th ed, gonna go read it
Feb 21 14:30:09 <machinehum>	MacGyver: Yeah I tried bridging, but that seems like it would only work on ethernet
Feb 21 14:31:17 <machinehum>	MacGyver: Thanks, AP + DHCP server is working, but it seems masquerading is not
Feb 21 14:32:08 <machinehum>	I believe I'm doing that (probably incorrectly) in there ~5 lines https://github.com/o7-machinehum/sipeed_lichee_rv/blob/master/package/blackhat/src/blackhat.sh#L44
Feb 21 14:32:31 <MacGyver>	machinehum: The paste you showed earlier is missing the nat table of netfilter, can you show that?
Feb 21 14:33:05 <machinehum>	What's the command to get that?
Feb 21 14:33:06 <MacGyver>	machinehum: Your --list probably only showed the filter table, that's the default.
Feb 21 14:33:18 <MacGyver>	machinehum: Honestly I just usually ask for the output of `iptables-save`.
Feb 21 14:35:02 <Blondie101010>	if you look at your scripts, it could give you hints...  I strongly suggest you look at man pages to know what the commands you run do
Feb 21 14:35:10 <Blondie101010>	iptables -t nat -nvL
Feb 21 14:37:05 <machinehum>	I know MacGyver https://pastebin.com/raw/JAHkz2sU
Feb 21 14:37:36 <machinehum>	Blondie101010: I have a decent idea of what _most_ commands in the script do
Feb 21 14:38:48 <machinehum>	I think my issue is basically the two subnets, I'm not sure it should be setup like that, this is why I was asking about this Pinging command from one subnet to another
Feb 21 14:39:33 <Blondie101010>	you really need to know what you're asking and use words others recognize
Feb 21 14:39:38 <Blondie101010>	if you want to ping, ping
Feb 21 14:40:20 <Blondie101010>	what part is not working...  do give a very specific example
Feb 21 14:40:47 <Blondie101010>	feeling it will be for the other side of NAT to reach NATed hosts
Feb 21 14:44:23 <djph>	Blondie101010: he's got (I forget, let's just say TEST_NET_1 and _2) and running "ping -I [if_1] TEST_NET_2" and wondering why it doesn't work when "IF-1" is on TEST_NET_1
Feb 21 14:51:13 <machinehum>	So the way I understand this working is on the (wlan1, $RADIO_AP) 192.168.99.x network the clients will connect, they are given an IP via my dhcp server (dnsmasq), config here: https://pastebin.com/raw/eym63f2f - this works great so far. Then their traffic should be routed though to (wlan0, $RADIO_CLIENT) and eventually the internet, I believe this is done via. this command here:        
Feb 21 14:51:15 <machinehum>	iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $RADIO_CLIENT -j MASQUERADE. What I am seeing is this final routing step isn't happening.
Feb 21 14:51:47 <machinehum>	Sorry for being vague before, I hope that's perhaps less vague
Feb 21 14:52:08 <Blondie101010>	no you avoided describing the problem!
Feb 21 14:52:19 <Blondie101010>	what part is not happening?
Feb 21 14:52:28 <Blondie101010>	give a SINGLE command and output that fails
Feb 21 14:52:56 <Blondie101010>	start with ping
Feb 21 14:53:13 <Blondie101010>	is there a ping that fails that shouldn't?  if so, give the exact command and output
Feb 21 14:53:59 <machinehum>	Well I guess my first question would be is ping a good way to test this?
Feb 21 14:54:21 <Blondie101010>	anyways, if you ever want to start learning about security, you should at least learn to use a computer and network first
Feb 21 14:55:05 <Blondie101010>	skilled security experts are typically good programmers with fairly advanced networking skills
Feb 21 14:55:59 <djph>	machinehum: no.
Feb 21 14:56:30 <Blondie101010>	machinehum:  I really would have liked to give you commands but you give no clarification at all
Feb 21 14:56:36 <Blondie101010>	what does not work?
Feb 21 15:02:40 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 21 15:02:41 *	litharge removes quiet on $a:epony
Feb 21 15:02:41 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 21 15:04:12 <mcon>	I need to debug a wireless DHCP negotiation and I don't know how to proceed (I'm not a net guru, by far!) I have a custom bridging A.P. built on a Debian bookworm distro using hostapd. Apparently connection and authorization are ok (hostapd sees station) but DHCP (which should be provided by another machine) does not happen as if bridgingis failing somehow. Can someone help?
Feb 21 15:08:30 <Inline>	wow
Feb 21 15:08:40 <Inline>	i was able to bridge wifi to bridge
Feb 21 15:08:55 <Inline>	erm add
Feb 21 15:09:19 <Inline>	hmm, now all the vms work but laptop has no internet lol
Feb 21 15:13:30 <djph>	Inline: oops
Feb 21 15:13:42 <Inline>	hahahaha
Feb 21 15:14:39 <mercenary>	VMs, internet, wifi. Pick any 2?
Feb 21 15:15:17 <djph>	^ especially with wifi
Feb 21 15:15:30 <djph>	hell, wifi might be "pick any 1"
Feb 21 15:17:09 <machinehum>	Blondie101010: Yeah, you're probably right, I should read a bit more
Feb 21 15:17:47 <machinehum>	Honestly what "doesn't work" is my phone won't get internet when I connect to the AP but I don't think that's enough info for anyone to help me
Feb 21 15:20:00 <djph>	machinehum: okay, so a device behind that router doesn't get past the router.  Run tcpdump on the "AP" interface -- do you see traffic reaching the router from the client device (yes or no)?  Run tcpdump on the "WAN" interface; do you see the traffic leaving (yes or no)
Feb 21 15:25:33 <RoyalYork>	I've been out of the DNS game for a while. Is bind still the go to daemon or is there another dns sever that is best practice to use?
Feb 21 15:26:28 <djph>	bind9 is my goto still. Granted it's a bit "heavy" for my smalltime network, but I don't wanna learn something else :P
Feb 21 15:27:08 <qman>	It's fine, but it has a lot of issues, you have to be careful about how you deploy it
Feb 21 15:27:15 <RoyalYork>	Back in the early 2000s, i had the original DNS & Bind book with the butterfly on it :D
Feb 21 15:27:31 <RoyalYork>	qman, Im just setting up a forward DNS
Feb 21 15:27:36 <djph>	to be fair, "you have to be careful" kind of applies to all web-services :)
Feb 21 15:27:42 <djph>	*internet-service
Feb 21 15:27:44 <RoyalYork>	internal use only, no public access
Feb 21 15:27:49 <djph>	pffft, coffeetime
Feb 21 15:28:13 <dminuoso>	by default I would probably recommend `knot`.
Feb 21 15:28:24 <nullvalue>	sudo make coffee
Feb 21 15:28:39 <qman>	Sure, point being that it would be insane to deploy bind outside of a jail or full apparmor/selinux
Feb 21 15:28:44 <dminuoso>	powerdns if you require an API for some reason
Feb 21 15:28:51 <qman>	While tinydns, for example, has no such need
Feb 21 15:28:54 <dminuoso>	bind if you're used to it and dont want to learn anythinng new
Feb 21 15:29:16 <dminuoso>	but I find that `knot` has the least obnoxious source code.
Feb 21 15:29:59 <qman>	For home use, lately I've been using technitium DNS, not sure what it runs under the hood, but it's convenient
Feb 21 15:30:19 <mercenary>	there's also unbound, if you primarily need 'some resolver'
Feb 21 15:30:32 <qman>	And dnsmasq
Feb 21 15:30:55 <qman>	I don't like dnsmasq's configuration style though 
Feb 21 15:31:00 <mercenary>	eew. if you worry about bind, I'd also worry about dnsmasq
Feb 21 15:31:11 <dminuoso>	dnsmasq does not recurse.
Feb 21 15:31:26 <mercenary>	Way too many functions in one program
Feb 21 15:31:29 <dminuoso>	And its authoritative featureset is limited.
Feb 21 16:07:45 <tomman>	OK, apparently TP-Stink does managed switches that support VLANs, nice
Feb 21 16:08:04 <tomman>	I HOPE that the switches at my customer are from that variety, but my hopes are rock bottom
Feb 21 16:09:00 <tomman>	for whatever reason they max out at 16 ports for the managed ones, with a 24 port version "Coming Soon™" - the regular unmanaged ones go up to 48 ports
Feb 21 16:09:07 <rpifan>	hellos
Feb 21 16:10:35 <rpifan>	what is the best way to limit access to a port to a specific ip range?
Feb 21 16:10:40 <Allie`>	firewall
Feb 21 16:17:31 <dminuoso>	depends a lot on what you consider "the best"
Feb 21 16:18:06 <dminuoso>	If your problem is building a nuclear reactor rod control computer, and you want to limit access to the process to just a workstation, the best way is to isolate the network such that no other hosts with other IP addresses are physically present.
Feb 21 16:18:39 <dminuoso>	In case you are building a nuclear reactor, can I have some fuel rods? Asking for a friend.
Feb 21 16:18:44 <NeoThermic_II>	you mean *don't* put the waterpumps on an IoT device connected to the internet? :P
Feb 21 16:19:24 <rpifan>	just dont want pplp seeing our openvpn cliients
Feb 21 16:19:55 <dminuoso>	But yeah, firewall - whether its host based firewalling or some firewall appliance in between.
Feb 21 16:20:06 <dminuoso>	Depends a bit on your taste, preferences and corporate guidelines.
Feb 21 16:26:53 <Inline>	dnsmasq,bind9,avahi-daemon,dhcpcd,dhclient....
Feb 21 16:27:11 <uwu>	but if u wanna work from home just put the water pump controls on the internet
Feb 21 16:27:56 <machinehum>	I think there's something wrong with my packets, there's a few retransmissions, and then an ack
Feb 21 16:27:58 <machinehum>	https://pastebin.com/raw/x8sJYmtR
Feb 21 16:28:31 <machinehum>	Maybe my SoC is too slow

Feb 21 16:54:03 <Cowclops>	Mmm what with vmware's impending doom, i just got proxmox up and running
Feb 21 16:54:26 <Cowclops>	this SEEMS pretty good. The one thing i had ot learn is syntax for like doing bridges/bonds/vlans on linux just because my prior use cases were more like "one nic, one network, thats it"
Feb 21 16:55:05 <Cowclops>	Its not hard and i figured out in about 45 mnutes after watching one 10 minute youtube video. Now i've got vlan aware bridge, with LACP bond of two nics working as expected (tested by alternating which cable was plugged in, got all the right kernel messages)
Feb 21 16:55:15 <Cowclops>	And i'm installing win11 right now 
Feb 21 16:55:19 <Cowclops>	(in a vm)
Feb 21 16:55:58 <Cowclops>	The thing i'm a /very/ big fan of is that i can boot from and use zfs as my underlying storage. No raid card, just build the pool the way i want to build it. It even has a box on filesystem creation to specify maximum ARC so zfs does'nt take ram away from potentila VMs
Feb 21 16:56:11 <Cowclops>	i think it defaulted to 3GB (i think its 10%) but i made it 8GB cuz yolo, on a system with 32GB
Feb 21 16:56:34 <Cowclops>	If we move our actual infratsructure to this (and/or when we move our actual infrastructure to this) nothing we have has less than 128GB ram, so a 16GB ARC should be a-ok
Feb 21 17:11:05 <Blondie101010>	machinehum:  that does indicate a L2 problem, but I'm actually a bit surprised that it does go through after 10ms
Feb 21 17:12:11 <Blondie101010>	is any involved device short on any resource?
Feb 21 17:42:17 <machinehum>	Blondie101010: The host is a 1.0Ghz single core riscv chip, allwinner D1
Feb 21 17:42:26 <machinehum>	I figured it ... should be good enough
Feb 21 17:45:12 <machinehum>	But maybe not
Feb 21 17:50:32 <Blondie101010>	my point was not to guess but to check each device involved
Feb 21 17:51:03 <Blondie101010>	is that host starving any resource when it's slow in responding?
Feb 21 17:51:55 <javi404>	+Cowclops hardware raid died with modern CPUs
Feb 21 17:53:47 <javi404>	zfs is the answer for sure.
Feb 21 17:54:27 <javi404>	why did Broadcom even bother buying VMware?
Feb 21 17:59:37 <Inline>	what is the hairpin mode for bridges and bridge elements ?
Feb 21 17:59:42 <Inline>	what does it do ?
Feb 21 18:00:09 <Inline>	and btw do i have to enable stp for a small network ?
Feb 21 18:01:18 <Inline>	afaik it does topology discovery, but for a static bridge with non-changing nets, i don't think it shoud be required right ?
Feb 21 18:01:36 <Inline>	btw. when i enable or disable stp does not much difference here over as far as i can observe
Feb 21 18:02:23 <Thuryn>	STP does not exactly do "topology discovery"
Feb 21 18:02:39 <Thuryn>	it establishes a tree-shaped forwarding structure
Feb 21 18:03:09 <Thuryn>	if you have no loops in your network, then what it does, in effect, is prevent accidental loop creation in your network
Feb 21 18:03:17 <Inline>	ah
Feb 21 18:03:44 <Thuryn>	if you DO have loops in your network, then it resolves those loops, and holds the "blocked" pathways in reserve in case the designated pathway fails
Feb 21 18:03:56 <Inline>	good to know
Feb 21 18:04:14 <Inline>	thank you
Feb 21 18:04:42 <Thuryn>	the "discovery" part is fairly limited.  Each switch knows:  1) who the root bridge is, 2) what port on THIS switch leads to the root bridge, 3) what ports THIS switch is responsible for forwarding to
Feb 21 18:04:43 <Inline>	and what is the hairpin stuff ?
Feb 21 18:05:13 <Thuryn>	i've never seen a hairpin topology on a switch.  it implies that packets can come in on a port and be sent back out that same port.
Feb 21 18:05:34 <Thuryn>	i've never seen a case where that is desirable
Feb 21 18:05:37 <Inline>	ok
Feb 21 18:05:45 <Inline>	so should be rather turned off
Feb 21 18:05:59 <Thuryn>	i would until I know very clearly what it's for
Feb 21 18:06:02 <Inline>	i mean i turned them on but it didn't make any difference either
Feb 21 18:06:15 <Inline>	so i'm gonna turn that off right now again
Feb 21 18:07:22 <Allie`>	Thuryn: it's useful in setups where you're doing lots of multicast
Feb 21 18:07:31 <Allie`>	not always useful, but sometimes useful
Feb 21 18:08:06 <Thuryn>	i believe you, though I still don't get why, at L2 anyway
Feb 21 19:33:25 <javi404>	when your boss finds out you have only been with the company for 0.9 years, then wonders why you don't know their crap systems inside out.
Feb 21 19:33:29 <javi404>	SMH
Feb 21 19:43:25 <kevin-oculus>	sometimes it takes time to believe you work for a crap boss
Feb 21 19:44:09 <tercaL>	Bosses are usually crappier
Feb 21 19:47:16 <kevin-oculus>	crappier then stalin
Feb 21 19:52:14 <shtrb>	javi404, your TL should have trained you , normally companies would train their eomployees, for instance in my team it takes 6 months of training for a person to be able to produce proper results 
Feb 21 19:52:39 <shtrb>	TL := Team Leader

Feb 21 20:45:21 <Dex2x>	Nokia make all in one now 
Feb 21 21:26:04 <nshire>	the new ubiquiti hardware is looking pretty good
Feb 21 21:26:08 <nshire>	I like the new switches
Feb 21 21:47:16 <RoyalYork>	Can unbound be used for resolving internal ip numbers to a fqdn?
Feb 21 21:47:26 <RoyalYork>	Or should I stick with bind
Feb 21 21:52:37 <JakLareo>	RoyalYork: just to make sure, are you asking about reverse DNS records?
Feb 21 21:54:04 <RoyalYork>	Ok. I have domain.com and internally I have 10.10.10.10. I want to create a record internally so that when i goto server1.domain.com, the dns will send me to 10.10.10.10
Feb 21 21:54:17 <RoyalYork>	and if server2.domain.com to go to 10.10.10.20
Feb 21 21:54:18 <RoyalYork>	etc
Feb 21 21:55:28 <JakLareo>	So that's standard DNS A records. Resolving a domain name to an IP address, not the other way around
Feb 21 21:55:53 <JakLareo>	Unbound has the concept of both "local-zone" and "local-data," to provide information for zones and specific DNS names, respectively: https://unbound.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/manpages/unbound.conf.html#unbound-conf-local-zone
Feb 21 21:56:10 <RoyalYork>	Thank you for the clarification and the link
Feb 21 21:56:42 <JakLareo>	However, it's a bit tedious, and I'd only recommend it for a very limited number of records. If you have more extensive needs, run your own authoritative DNS, such as bind or powerDNS, and forward queries to it with Unbound
Feb 21 22:02:48 <javi404>	shtrb: my team leader basically ignored me for like 6 months.
Feb 21 22:03:03 <javi404>	now i have a new boss since I switched roles
Feb 21 22:04:25 <javi404>	kevin-oculus: i think the guy who originally hired me was just super busy, his boss probably forced him to hire someone.
Feb 21 22:04:32 <javi404>	then he abandoned me.
Feb 21 22:04:51 <javi404>	I started looking for a job because how long is doing nothing going to work for them while they are paying me.
Feb 21 22:05:23 <Thuryn>	that sounds wise
Feb 21 22:05:42 <javi404>	then before being put on the bench, i found a new role, happy about it now. but still the shit systems are new to me. even guy on my team is new to the systems, the shitty trainings.
Feb 21 22:05:53 <javi404>	Thuryn: yeah, i got bills to pay.
Feb 21 22:06:11 <javi404>	one of the mandatory trainings, legit, how to drive.
Feb 21 22:06:50 <javi404>	some gamification. like, im in the USA not India, I passed my drivers license test decades ago. lol.
Feb 21 22:08:04 <Thuryn>	a few things have changed, though
Feb 21 22:08:07 <Thuryn>	roundabouts
Feb 21 22:08:13 <Thuryn>	mobile devices
Feb 21 22:08:17 <Thuryn>	touch interfaces
Feb 21 22:08:49 <Thuryn>	backup cameras, some of the "you're an idiot" features
Feb 21 22:09:40 <Thuryn>	i still have things I don't know about the legalities of roundabouts (though I haven't cared enough to look them up so how big a deal could they be)
Feb 21 22:51:18 <Inline>	i don't know how i managed to set it all up, but i configured a bond, to which i added the bridge and to the bridge all the rest 
Feb 21 22:52:14 <Inline>	formerly my laptop didn't get any connections, now the laptop and the vms all have connections
Feb 21 22:52:38 <Inline>	not sure if i added some iptable rules to make it work, or it worked outright without any intervention

Feb 21 23:28:53 *	Whiskey` burys javi404 in a jail so secret no one even feeds the prisoners
Feb 21 23:28:54 <javi404>	camera under the solar panels watching the whole yard. thank you whoever came up with the idea of PoE (and a splitter to usb)
Feb 21 23:29:04 <javi404>	black site?
Feb 21 23:29:13 <javi404>	hehehe
Feb 21 23:29:13 <Whiskey`>	its so black its ultra
Feb 21 23:29:24 <Whiskey`>	we dont even send food in. just new prisoners
Feb 21 23:29:38 <javi404>	raymond reddington black level site?
Feb 21 23:29:51 <Whiskey`>	na those are very obvious
Feb 21 23:30:21 <Whiskey`>	lots of people working them. food, water, power, waste. very messy
Feb 21 23:30:34 <javi404>	yeah, too many eyes and ears
Feb 21 23:30:44 <Whiskey`>	mines a bell shaped hole 483 feet back inside a mountain
Feb 21 23:30:48 <javi404>	deserted island, like australia
Feb 21 23:31:12 <javi404>	been watching some videos on att long lines with the bunkers from the 60s
Feb 21 23:31:14 <javi404>	cool shit
Feb 21 23:31:24 <Whiskey`>	ive been in some of those
Feb 21 23:31:26 <javi404>	some people just happen to have them on their property.
Feb 21 23:31:29 <Whiskey`>	cool and scary
Feb 21 23:31:46 <javi404>	24 inch concrete underground, sounds safe to me.
Feb 21 23:32:20 <javi404>	so i was digging, found 2 in my area, but i don't think they have bunkers, but would be interesting if they did considering the water table here in FL.
Feb 21 23:32:33 <javi404>	i plan to check them out. (if i can legalishly)
Feb 21 23:32:44 <javi404>	not sure if they are still in use, repurposed, etc.
Feb 21 23:32:55 <javi404>	2 towers still there.
Feb 21 23:33:49 <Whiskey`>	some have been, that was how i was involved
Feb 21 23:35:18 <Whiskey`>	http://long-lines.com/map
Feb 21 23:38:58 <Gaboradon>	Hello
Feb 21 23:39:17 <Whiskey`>	greetings a bad tidings.
Feb 21 23:39:35 <Gaboradon>	There's a bit of a confusion with PoE Adapter, Injector, manufacturers and sellers don't have a common name
Feb 21 23:40:21 <Whiskey`>	no there isnt
Feb 21 23:40:34 <Whiskey`>	there 802.3af standard, and 2 passive standards.
Feb 21 23:40:43 <Gaboradon>	Ubiquiti calls it an Adaptor, webshops call it an injector
Feb 21 23:41:07 <Whiskey`>	midspan injector is the correct name
Feb 21 23:41:15 <Gaboradon>	Some don't label anything, some label everything passive and don't explicitly label active, some don't list any standards, yet it has standards
Feb 21 23:41:19 <javi404>	Whiskey`: haha, exactly the map I was looking at.
Feb 21 23:41:26 <Whiskey`>	adapter tends to be used for one of the non standard ones
Feb 21 23:41:47 <Whiskey`>	javi404: figures, its easy to find. great resources 
Feb 21 23:41:50 <Gaboradon>	and "PoE Power Supply" is never used for 240AC to PoE
Feb 21 23:42:13 <javi404>	Gaboradon: this is where you look at the fine grey print on the adapter and see what the spec is or find documentation.
Feb 21 23:42:24 <Whiskey`>	Gaboradon: meh. it really doesnt matter the names used. you look at the input nad putputs to figure out if its what you need
Feb 21 23:42:46 <Whiskey`>	all of ubnt's adapters, injectors, etc, are 100v to 250vac
Feb 21 23:43:24 <Gaboradon>	Ubiquiti doesn't list some of their "PoE Adaptors" on their website so I can't get official manual about them, they only list PoE+ PoE++ - and there's no .3af/at standard being mentioned 
Feb 21 23:43:26 <Gaboradon>	https://store.ui.com/us/en/collections/unifi-accessory-tech-poe-and-power/products/u-poe-plus-plus?category=5570d10a-3bcb-42cc-a62f-b31778240a3c
Feb 21 23:43:58 <Whiskey`>	poe+ and ++ are standards
Feb 21 23:44:02 <Whiskey`>	af at bt
Feb 21 23:44:06 <Gaboradon>	The one I linked isn't the right one right?
Feb 21 23:44:26 <Whiskey`>	right one for /what/
Feb 21 23:44:37 <Whiskey`>	that is a 802.3at or bt adapter
Feb 21 23:44:43 <Allie>	what is the gear you are powering, i will recommend the correct injector
Feb 21 23:44:51 <Whiskey`>	^ just was typing that
Feb 21 23:45:10 <Gaboradon>	Ubiquiti also has these, but it looks like discontinued, official site links 404 https://www.mimovrste.com/mrezne-kartice-adapterji/ubiquiti-poe-injector-24vdc-24w-gbit-bel-poe-24-24w-g-wh-b
Feb 21 23:45:27 <zeratul>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REmuftIuTl0
Feb 21 23:45:38 <Whiskey`>	those are the old 24v non standard poe injectors
Feb 21 23:45:49 <Gaboradon>	Well now I found this https://dl.ubnt.com/datasheets/poe/PoE_Adapters_DS.pdf
Feb 21 23:45:53 <Whiskey`>	what is your device. that will tell you what you need
Feb 21 23:46:07 <Whiskey`>	we dont care. all that matters is your /device/. what is it.
Feb 21 23:46:29 <Whiskey`>	ubnt is very good on telling you what pse it needs
Feb 21 23:47:02 <Gaboradon>	It can take .3af/at, but the problem is I can't find a good pick on the sites I'm trying to buy because of a mess really of confused listings, missing details of etailers
Feb 21 23:47:33 <Allie>	for af and at, TL-POE160S
Feb 21 23:47:36 <Whiskey`>	ok af/at (and bt) are af poe+ and poe++
Feb 21 23:47:39 <Gaboradon>	The descriptions are so bad on some sites, because they're also translated, a foreign company has a local branch and stuff
Feb 21 23:48:24 <Gaboradon>	I had it open on another computer, trying to find it here ... I didn't saw any standard being mentioned on manufacturers site for PoE++ Adapter (ubiquiti)
Feb 21 23:48:35 <Allie>	Gaboradon: *what are you powering* 
Feb 21 23:48:37 <Allie>	what is the device on the end
Feb 21 23:48:38 <Whiskey`>	ok well fine something that says af, at(poe+) or bt(poe++)
Feb 21 23:48:40 <Allie>	what is it's model number
Feb 21 23:48:55 <Allie>	its'? it's? i never remember that one
Feb 21 23:49:24 <Whiskey`>	Allie: engrish says both are legal uses, no murder bot required.
Feb 21 23:49:34 <Allie>	excellent
Feb 21 23:49:44 <djph>	Allie: "it's" <-- "it is" // "its'" <-- ownership
Feb 21 23:49:53 <Allie>	it'sn't've
Feb 21 23:49:59 <Whiskey`>	heh
Feb 21 23:50:02 <Allie>	'st

Feb 21 23:50:50 <Gaboradon>	Here, this seller doesn't mention any .3 standards: https://www.senetic.co.uk/product/U-POE++
Feb 21 23:51:25 <Gaboradon>	Well oops no in this case I guess it does
Feb 21 23:51:45 <Whiskey`>	U-PoE++
Feb 21 23:51:51 <Whiskey`>	POE++ means 802.3bt
Feb 21 23:51:55 <Allie>	that is equivalent to the TL-POE170S
Feb 21 23:52:03 <Gaboradon>	Okay that's the ones I was initially looking at: https://www.senetic.co.uk/product/POE-24-24W-G-WH

Feb 21 23:52:23 <Whiskey`>	its not what you want
Feb 21 23:52:58 <Gaboradon>	Right but the Senetic site mentions it being 802.3at
Feb 21 23:53:11 <Gaboradon>	So it's also wrong wrong on so many levels there
Feb 21 23:53:23 <Gaboradon>	That's why I couldn't trust a thing anymore
Feb 21 23:53:35 <Allie>	generally i rely on linitx.com for PoE

Feb 21 23:53:52 <Gaboradon>	Right, .3bt is too much, my device does not support, only af/at
Feb 21 23:54:06 <Whiskey`>	the ubnt model number is all you need. ASSUMING we know what the device is, or that it at least /is/ a at af bt device
Feb 21 23:54:13 <Whiskey`>	no
Feb 21 23:54:17 <Gaboradon>	So I need to be sure standard is explicitly listed or else it's some passive injector without standard right?
Feb 21 23:54:20 <Whiskey`>	the device DOES support bt
Feb 21 23:54:30 <Whiskey`>	its not going to send any more power than the device asks for
Feb 21 23:54:46 <Allie>	what is the device? 
Feb 21 23:54:57 <Whiskey`>	Allie: super sekrut
Feb 21 23:54:59 <Gaboradon>	Mikrotik LTE Antenna manual does not list .3bt
Feb 21 23:55:07 <Allie>	okay, it's a mikrotik... sxt? 
Feb 21 23:55:08 <Whiskey`>	what one
Feb 21 23:55:20 <Allie>	i'm going to assume it's a recent SXT
Feb 21 23:55:23 <Whiskey`>	cause tik is great at labling the needs, and they should have sent you a pse
Feb 21 23:55:42 <Whiskey`>	.bt is 100% backwards compatible to af and at
Feb 21 23:56:05 <Allie>	the SXT can take up to 56v passive or 802.3af/at PoE. I would use my original recommendation, TL-POE160S
Feb 21 23:56:17 <Gaboradon>	The PD LTE4 receiver-to-ethernet device "you can connect PoE 802.3af/at or passive injector with xyz voltage" something like that
Feb 21 23:56:42 <Inline>	in rfkill list i see two phys listed, is that normal ? is one for the 2.4GHz net and the other for the 5G or is that a second interface i got there ?
Feb 21 23:56:58 <Whiskey`>	ok well you could use pretty much any pse with that device
Feb 21 23:57:44 <Inline>	actually i see 3 listed as WIFI

Feb 21 23:58:00 <Gaboradon>	Allie: Doesn't the TPlink one look cheaper, no built-in protection?
Feb 21 23:58:02 <Whiskey`>	Inline: pastebin
Feb 21 23:58:03 <Inline>	4 interfaces out of which only 1 is bluetooth
Feb 21 23:58:12 <Gaboradon>	versus U-PoE+
Feb 21 23:58:17 <Allie>	Gaboradon: what sort of built-in protection do you expect? 
Feb 21 23:58:43 <Gaboradon>	IDK but Ubiquiti listings mention it
Feb 21 23:58:49 <Allie>	ubiquiti say a lot of things
Feb 21 23:58:59 <Gaboradon>	But price is quite similar yeha
Feb 21 23:59:01 <Allie>	it's a sub-£20 PoE injector, it'll be a writeoff if it's struck by lightning
Feb 21 23:59:27 <Allie>	the TP-link is decent quality and has nice mounting holes, i have used a bunch of them over the years and i have had very few issues (and most of the issues were weather related) 
Feb 21 23:59:33 <Whiskey`>	why dont you just use the one that came with it
Feb 22 00:00:18 <Gaboradon>	Would this help? https://www.senetic.co.uk/product/ETH-SP-G2
Feb 22 00:00:59 <Whiskey`>	help with what exactly
Feb 22 00:01:00 <Allie>	Gaboradon: help against? 
Feb 22 00:01:10 <Whiskey`>	angry pixies
Feb 22 00:01:11 <Gaboradon>	Allie: if the injector would be the only writeoff that would be good enough as long as it protects downstream, but in it self it wouldn't probably right? So I need something extra probably?
Feb 22 00:01:23 <Allie>	i have an SXT on my roof. it is mounted to a metal pole that is well grounded, and taller than the SXT
Feb 22 00:01:32 <Gaboradon>	Seems like these protectors are meant for ESD, not for lightning.
Feb 22 00:01:40 <Inline>	https://ctxt.io/AADw9UxFFA
Feb 22 00:01:42 <Allie>	yes, it is very challenging to defend against lightning
Feb 22 00:01:44 <Whiskey`>	Gaboradon: more or less exactly
Feb 22 00:01:47 <Allie>	and ESD is unlikely to be an issue for you
Feb 22 00:01:56 <Gaboradon>	Sorry I'm totally unfamiliar with PoE, first time dealing with it, so IDK what SXT means
Feb 22 00:02:00 <Allie>	your mikrotik
Feb 22 00:02:02 <Allie>	whatever it is
Feb 22 00:02:06 <Allie>	you haven't told us
Feb 22 00:02:24 <Allie>	unless your device is on the end of a long cable a few tens of meters above you, ESD won't be an issue
Feb 22 00:02:46 <Gaboradon>	I did, Mikrotik LTE Receiver Modem with Antenna Kit LTE6 300mbit/50mbit
Feb 22 00:02:58 <Whiskey`>	thats not a tik /model/ name
Feb 22 00:03:17 <Gaboradon>	I'll find it whatever it is again 
Feb 22 00:03:31 <Allie>	anyway i do exactly this with a cable directly into my switch so //shrug
Feb 22 00:03:36 <Whiskey`>	^
Feb 22 00:03:46 <Allie>	it's been there for a few years across various houses
Feb 22 00:03:58 <Gaboradon>	https://www.senetic.co.uk/product/RBLHGR_R11e-LTE6
Feb 22 00:04:12 <Allie>	oh yeah that's an LHG which is like an SXT but bigger
Feb 22 00:05:21 <Gaboradon>	Anything against U-PoE+ then, Ubiquiti seems to have a lot of products meant for their own stuff and yes their claims and marketing seems flamboyant or how to describe it "they say a lot of things"
Feb 22 00:06:31 <Whiskey`>	why not use the one that came with the unit
Feb 22 00:06:52 <Whiskey`>	https://mikrotik.com/product/rblhgr
Feb 22 00:07:02 <Whiskey`>	it has a 24v passive injector stock. it works fine
Feb 22 00:08:35 <Gaboradon>	Allie: great, this one has a proper listing, lists all details ... such as 240V input and stuff, and labeled correctly as an  "injector" ... some descriptions on other PoE Injectors (adapters, whatever) say "input voltage 48V" so I was more and more confused 
Feb 22 00:08:36 <Gaboradon>	https://www.senetic.si/product/TL-POE160S
Feb 22 00:09:54 <Whiskey`>	ok well that will work but why pay extra
Feb 22 00:10:03 <Whiskey`>	it ships with what it needs
Feb 22 00:10:15 <Gaboradon>	Whiskey`, because everyone here was telling me DO NOT USE PASSIVE INJECTOR
Feb 22 00:10:42 <Whiskey`>	well those people are idiots who didnt bother to figure out what you even had
Feb 22 00:10:44 <Gaboradon>	Yeah, tho I don't know if it's gigabit rated.
Feb 22 00:11:37 <Whiskey`>	doesnt matter
Feb 22 00:11:41 <Whiskey`>	your LTE unit is not gige
Feb 22 00:11:45 <Gaboradon>	No we did had a big discussion and I kept saying, "it should work if it comes with the injector dongle right" but no ... then again, I kinda agree perhaps it's safer this way. I'm not really paying it, it's a business who needs this, they don't mind 20euro up or down
Feb 22 00:11:47 <Whiskey`>	its only 10/100
Feb 22 00:12:02 <Gaboradon>	It says 300mbit down
Feb 22 00:12:05 <Whiskey`>	no
Feb 22 00:12:11 <Whiskey`>	thats the LTE link, not the ethernet
Feb 22 00:12:23 <Whiskey`>	Details
Feb 22 00:12:23 <Whiskey`>	10/100 Ethernet ports 	1 
Feb 22 00:12:56 <Whiskey`>	your site has a issue
Feb 22 00:14:39 <Whiskey`>	RBLHGR&R11e-LTE6 does come with a gige injector
Feb 22 00:15:25 <Whiskey`>	er nope, it does, cause none of thme are gige
Feb 22 00:15:32 <Whiskey`>	wrong product line for gige
Feb 22 00:15:47 <oldfashionedcow>	are protectli boxen good?
Feb 22 00:16:04 <Whiskey`>	https://mikrotik.com/product/lhg_lte18
Feb 22 00:16:07 <Whiskey`>	thats the gige one
Feb 22 00:16:55 <Gaboradon>	The manual says 300mbit, let's not trust the sellers site
Feb 22 00:17:07 <Whiskey`>	and AGAIN thats the LTE not the ETHERNET
Feb 22 00:17:40 <tomman>	it's like plugging a 3G stick into a USB1.1 port
Feb 22 00:17:43 <Gaboradon>	LTE6 (300Mbit/s Downlink, 50Mbit/s Uplink) 
Feb 22 00:18:13 <Whiskey`>	15:17:07 <Whiskey`> and AGAIN thats the LTE not the ETHERNET
Feb 22 00:18:14 <Gaboradon>	I understand, if they're that stupid to not include a gigabit port then I guess screw it
Feb 22 00:18:17 <Whiskey`>	this has not changed
Feb 22 00:18:32 <Whiskey`>	you are just looking at the wrong product
Feb 22 00:18:32 <Gaboradon>	I wondered the same thing all along, what a bunch of nonsense
Feb 22 00:18:35 <Whiskey`>	thats not their fault
Feb 22 00:19:24 <Gaboradon>	No it is, if they do it 3 times over the 100mbit, then you would limit it  ... they have a lower model that does 150mbit, so they don't put a gigabit ethernet jack on that one as well
Feb 22 00:19:54 <Gaboradon>	I know there's a higher model, the buyer is not going to buy the costlier one, we were looking at the right product for the needs of the buyer (it's not me, someone else)
Feb 22 00:20:05 <Whiskey`>	yea most cell networks cant do that speed sustained anyhow so its a proper low end product.
Feb 22 00:20:12 <Whiskey`>	it gives /options/
Feb 22 00:20:32 <Whiskey`>	why spend more on a device for a network that wont ever reach that speed
Feb 22 00:20:33 <tomman>	We have 4G networks in this country
Feb 22 00:20:41 <tomman>	none of those networks can do speeds anywhere near 100Mbit
Feb 22 00:20:55 <Gaboradon>	Well it is what it is, the purchase is just around the corner, there will be no more changes, it's enough, gigabit or not
Feb 22 00:20:59 <Whiskey`>	tomman: you mean that fake 4g stuff that is 3g
Feb 22 00:21:07 <tomman>	no, "actual" 4G LTE
Feb 22 00:21:31 <tomman>	but our telcos as usual took a smelly dump over the actual deployment
Feb 22 00:21:43 <tomman>	the best I've recorded here is about ~20Mbps
Feb 22 00:21:43 <Whiskey`>	rosey
Feb 22 00:21:56 <Whiskey`>	over subbed or under backhauled
Feb 22 00:22:13 <tomman>	one of our telcos have speeds worse than DSL on their 4G, and only when it isn't busy stalling more than a 737 MAX
Feb 22 00:22:46 <Gaboradon>	Well I think if it's 20 it'll be 4-5 times better than it's now, the problem is currently it's not even a stable connection, if the buyer gets a stable connection 95% or more of the time with at least 15mbit it'll be fine
Feb 22 00:22:57 <Whiskey`>	tomman: nice
Feb 22 00:23:15 <Whiskey`>	Gaboradon: ok
Feb 22 00:23:17 <tomman>	of course let's better not speak about our data plans :D
Feb 22 00:23:42 <Whiskey`>	tomman: i dont see how starling hasnt taken your country by storm
Feb 22 00:24:02 <tomman>	because the Muskrat hasn't learned yet how to read a South America map?
Feb 22 00:24:32 <tomman>	it would certainly have a good reception among those wealthy enough to afford it
Feb 22 00:24:32 <Whiskey`>	more likely it hasnt been approved for use there
Feb 22 00:26:04 <tomman>	I should check the approval listings from our censor, er, telco regulator, but I would not surprise me if they haven't bothered to get it approved here
Feb 22 00:26:26 <Whiskey`>	well starlink has tried in many places and got told no
Feb 22 00:26:47 <tomman>	wonder if they have actually tried in Latin America
Feb 22 00:26:53 <tomman>	at least Brazil
Feb 22 00:27:21 <tomman>	if ANATEL approves your junk, then the rest of South America regulators will tag on
Feb 22 00:28:30 <javi404>	tomman:  you can always do what the Canadians did back in the day with Dish and Directv (well kind of). Order the service from the USA, and set it up there.
Feb 22 00:28:53 <javi404>	there are mobile plans now and new dishes for boats and rvs from last I checked Starlink.
Feb 22 00:29:09 <Whiskey`>	https://www.instagram.com/caracaslink/?hl=en
Feb 22 00:29:11 <javi404>	im plan to get starlink very soon since im in hurricane zone.
Feb 22 00:29:32 <Whiskey`>	javi404: secure it well
Feb 22 00:29:50 <javi404>	it will be for backup
Feb 22 00:30:17 <javi404>	since i figure if comcast goes down, everyone will be maxing out t-mobile, or worse that tower goes down.
Feb 22 00:30:26 <javi404>	but hurricane wont affect a satalite link.
Feb 22 00:30:52 <Whiskey`>	javi404: well, it will for a little while
Feb 22 00:31:06 <tomman>	does it operate on a freq not vulnerable to rain fade?
Feb 22 00:31:12 <Whiskey`>	no
Feb 22 00:31:22 <Whiskey`>	everything has rain fade. its aobut how much
Feb 22 00:31:54 <tomman>	never noticed it with cellphones, but sat TV was basically? "is it raining? Then shut down the TV!"
Feb 22 00:32:31 <javi404>	tomman: usually after the storm, nothing but sunshine and clear skies. Just no electricity and telecom depending on how bad it is.
Feb 22 00:32:59 <Gaboradon>	Whiskey`, hey wait, I actually appreciate your input and time for looking up that key distinction, I apologize for kinda rudely responding, I'm a bit butthurt but hey you gave me an idea, I'll actually suggest to the buyers to take the more expensive one.
Feb 22 00:33:39 <Whiskey`>	Gaboradon: its fine
Feb 22 00:34:57 <Gaboradon>	Because the buyer is used to gigabit speeds over optical at home, if they only get 20 megabit in that location it'll be quite a letdown once computers, cameras, IPTV and stuff moves in, it's a business factory location, and they wanted to use LTE antenna to avoid paying 1000euro for 500 meters of channel digging for optical cable laying.
Feb 22 00:35:17 <Whiskey`>	hahahah
Feb 22 00:35:23 <Whiskey`>	your client is screwed
Feb 22 00:35:30 <Whiskey`>	you, and they, have no idea
Feb 22 00:36:22 *	javi404 wonders if there is a PoE smart bulb.
Feb 22 00:36:41 <Whiskey`>	javi404: yes there is
Feb 22 00:36:52 <Whiskey`>	AND! there are ones that are LiFi!
Feb 22 00:36:53 <Gaboradon>	So, would it fair any better if we took the higher end "gigabit" mikrotik antenna model, our ISP responded that a LTE (4G) tower is 2.35km away and it's all flat-land with 80% empty farmland in between and the network load is light
Feb 22 00:36:56 <Whiskey`>	optical wifi
Feb 22 00:37:35 <Whiskey`>	Gaboradon: does the isp promise that lte will get you X mbits/s and no data cap?
Feb 22 00:37:50 <Whiskey`>	forget what the /radio/ can do. what is the plan the isp is selling
Feb 22 00:38:17 <javi404>	i was reading about that optical wifi someone posted the other day, cool shit.
Feb 22 00:38:57 <Gaboradon>	Wait, 4G isn't the same as LTE?
Feb 22 00:39:03 <Whiskey`>	heh
Feb 22 00:39:04 <Whiskey`>	no
Feb 22 00:39:17 <Whiskey`>	there are overlaps
Feb 22 00:39:23 <Gaboradon>	Weird lol, I do mostly computers, I don't do mobile much
Feb 22 00:39:27 <tomman>	eh, what?
Feb 22 00:39:34 <tomman>	I thought LTE _was_ 4G
Feb 22 00:39:37 <tomman>	all of it
Feb 22 00:39:55 <Gaboradon>	I see it being always mentioned as "LTE (4G)" so kinda not my fault if everyone else labels it like that
Feb 22 00:39:58 <tomman>	like "finally the industry agreed into a single standard instead of this GSM-vs-CDMA war"
Feb 22 00:40:06 <Whiskey`>	maybe im thinking backwards, forrest n trees
Feb 22 00:40:14 <Whiskey`>	its been a looooong damn week
Feb 22 00:40:35 <tomman>	5G does piggyback on LTE (The NSA variety which most telcos have deployed so far), but it doesn't have to (the SA variety)
Feb 22 00:41:47 <Whiskey`>	ah k, lte came before 4g so i was thinking backwards
Feb 22 00:44:26 <Gaboradon>	I looked at the 5G standards papers, it has so many of the similar frequencies that it's totally meaningless as far as speeds go, and then they say a lot of 5G tech was already pre-installed in the infrastructure so it just has to be "turned on" and stuff, it's a mess, and 5G keeps being extended and added upon in revisions, total confusion, a mess
Feb 22 00:45:31 <tomman>	and now it's time for 6G
Feb 22 00:45:43 <Gaboradon>	With so many "modes" of operation, different frequencies, from these sub 10GHZ ones, to the 60GHZ ones, what's the point, the label is meaningless
Feb 22 00:45:45 <tomman>	harder better stronger etc.
Feb 22 00:46:34 <tomman>	the frequency table mess in part is the fault of governments around the world, where the radio spectrum is treated like a special snowflake
Feb 22 00:46:56 <tomman>	but many of those ridiculously high frequencies... eh, I can't see any real world uses for it
Feb 22 00:51:06 <Whiskey`>	tomman: FWA
Feb 22 00:52:28 <Whiskey`>	cellcos in the usa went for them just to take them away from wisps. its a long and sorid tail that if you had been in some of the meetings its amazing. our own org voted against us and handed crap to the cellco's
Feb 22 00:53:53 <Whiskey`>	waaaat inthe fkn hell
Feb 22 00:55:57 <tomman>	simpler things here
Feb 22 00:56:07 <tomman>	we only have 3 cell telcos, all of them with nationwide coverage
Feb 22 00:56:49 <tomman>	two of them (Telefonica's Movistar, and the state-owned Movilnet) have always used American frequencies for their GSM/UMTS service (alongside its long gone AMPS/TDMA/CDMA networks)
Feb 22 00:57:31 <tomman>	want a LTE phone for them? Then you need B4.
Feb 22 00:57:40 <tomman>	the third one is... a special snowflake, Digitel
Feb 22 00:58:06 <tomman>	for $RAISINS, they started into the 2G era with EUROPEAN bands, one of the few rare GSM telcos using non-American frequencies in Latam
Feb 22 00:58:43 <tomman>	they tried to correct that error early into the 3G era, but turns out they were small enough that no cellphone OEM would make 900/1900MHz UMTS cellphones for them
Feb 22 00:59:06 <tomman>	(and the telco regulator here refused to sell them the 1800MHz band for UMTS)
Feb 22 00:59:15 <tomman>	so again, euro cellphones.
Feb 22 00:59:25 <tomman>	(and a gimped 900MHz band for other reasons)
Feb 22 00:59:39 <tomman>	they repeated the same mistake with LTE - you need B3 for them!
Feb 22 00:59:55 <tomman>	but these days it doesn't matter - any $100+ cellphone supports B3 and B4, so you're golden here
Feb 22 01:00:49 <tomman>	it's only a problem if you stick to sub-$100 smartphones, or 3G dumbphones (you can still find them if you look hard enough, but 99% of the times they're 850/1900MHz only)
Feb 22 01:01:04 <tomman>	maybe sometimes with a useless 2100MHz band on top
Feb 22 01:02:38 <tomman>	https://www.logicmobility.com/es/feature-phones/a5l/ or just buy this, it's a legit dumbphone, does LTE, and it supports all the relevant freq bands for us :)
Feb 22 01:02:46 <tomman>	(it costs $35)
Feb 22 01:03:12 <tomman>	sadly telcos here have no schedule for fucking deploying VoLTE
Feb 22 01:27:13 <minimal>	tomman: would that be 120 VoLTEs or 230 VoLTEs? ;-)
Feb 22 01:28:08 <Whiskey`>	its 240 VoLTEsplit phase
Feb 22 01:32:19 <MacGyver>	400 kVoLTE for long-range transmission.
Feb 22 01:35:50 <tomman>	split phase AKA "my aircon is weird, but so is every residential aircon in this hole"
Feb 22 01:42:36 <Whiskey`>	ha not that kinda split
Feb 22 01:45:54 <tomman>	blame Edison
Feb 22 01:46:32 <Whiskey`>	i do
Feb 22 02:28:45 <hjf>	how does name resolution work in windows when ipv6 is active and there's no dhcpv6 server? does windows use mDNS, does it still use NetBIOS or ? because my router hands out IPv4 addresses over DHCP and from that i can look up DNS. but obviously it knows nothing about the hosts' v6 addresses
Feb 22 02:38:20 <djph>	hjf: a DNS server queried on v4 can still return AAAA records ... 
Feb 22 02:40:14 <Inline>	what is /sys/class/net/<iface>/threaded for ?
Feb 22 02:47:16 <Blondie101010>	a quick google search gives: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-net
Feb 22 02:47:21 <Blondie101010>	look at the bottom
Feb 22 02:48:27 <Blondie101010>	if the question is about the meaning of the word "threaded", it will probably require a lot more reading
Feb 22 02:50:11 <hjf>	djph: yes but i run no DHCPv6 server on my network. everyone is SLAAC. so there's no way for my DNS server to know about these hosts
Feb 22 02:50:39 <Blondie101010>	hjf:  you're mixing things up
Feb 22 02:50:59 <Blondie101010>	there will not be any magic solution
Feb 22 02:51:05 <Blondie101010>	if you want something to work, you set it up
Feb 22 02:51:22 <Blondie101010>	build your DNS zone if that's what you need
Feb 22 02:51:45 <Blondie101010>	but as you mentioned, mdns could be an option to consider
Feb 22 03:05:29 <hjf>	so apparently there's really no solution for this
Feb 22 03:05:42 <hjf>	dnsmasq does a hacky thing with SLAAC hosts
Feb 22 03:06:03 <hjf>	it assumes all hosts who requested a DHCP address also have a DHCPv6 address generated with SLAAC
Feb 22 03:06:23 <hjf>	so it tries to ping the calculated SLAAC address, from the MAC addres from the DHCP (v4) entry
Feb 22 03:06:47 <hjf>	and if it gets a response, it uses this IPv6 address for the AAAA record
Feb 22 03:07:44 <hjf>	mDNS has the limitation that onyl the .local domain can be resolved
Feb 22 03:18:28 <Blondie101010>	are you trying to make something work, or to complain about every little detail that will make you workj?
Feb 22 03:19:12 <Blondie101010>	if you need DNS, set it up
Feb 22 03:20:45 <Blondie101010>	using DHCP would not solve most DNS resolver config problems
Feb 22 03:20:58 <Blondie101010>	focus on the problems as you encounter them
Feb 22 03:22:17 <Blondie101010>	if you control the edge, you could hijack DNS, but that wouldn't work for Do* 
Feb 22 03:23:22 <hjf>	you're obviously seeing something i'm not
Feb 22 03:23:41 <Blondie101010>	so far you seem to be going in eternal circles
Feb 22 03:23:41 <hjf>	i hope one day i'll be enlightened as well
Feb 22 03:23:54 <Blondie101010>	start doing it
Feb 22 03:23:58 <hjf>	because you sure as fuck aren't providing any actual answers
Feb 22 03:24:11 <hjf>	you just tell me to "set up dns"
Feb 22 03:24:16 <Blondie101010>	ehhhh
Feb 22 03:24:19 <hjf>	i don't understand what you're trying to say
Feb 22 03:24:27 <hjf>	you want me to configure DNS manually? 
Feb 22 03:24:47 <Blondie101010>	if you need a course on that, you probably need a course for Computers for Dummies first
Feb 22 03:24:54 <Blondie101010>	if that is what you need, YES!
Feb 22 03:24:58 <Blondie101010>	of course
Feb 22 03:25:17 <hjf>	ok so for each host i add to my network i go and look at the screen
Feb 22 03:25:22 <hjf>	and copy and paste the address
Feb 22 03:25:25 <hjf>	very fucking practical
Feb 22 03:25:56 <Blondie101010>	if you need client devices to use your DNS server, yes, but even that is not fully guaranteed, as I hinted with my "Do*" comment
Feb 22 03:26:07 <Blondie101010>	you can not bypass that directly
Feb 22 03:26:30 <hjf>	ok i'll try to explain my situation again
Feb 22 03:26:32 <Blondie101010>	it implies configuring some options on each client 
Feb 22 03:26:44 <Blondie101010>	no please don't
Feb 22 03:26:52 <Blondie101010>	SLAAC is not relevant to DNS
Feb 22 03:27:41 <Blondie101010>	I know what you're hoping for, and it's clearly a lot of wasted time for nothing at all because you end up doing NOTHING
Feb 22 03:28:00 <Blondie101010>	go find a tutorial on setting up a popular DNS service
Feb 22 03:28:20 <Blondie101010>	I'd use bind9
Feb 22 03:28:26 <hjf>	Blondie101010: are you stupid?
Feb 22 03:28:29 <Blondie101010>	what?
Feb 22 03:28:34 <hjf>	serious question
Feb 22 03:28:36 <hjf>	are you stupid?
Feb 22 03:28:44 <Blondie101010>	no but you are
Feb 22 03:28:50 <hjf>	i'm not
Feb 22 03:28:51 <Blondie101010>	why are you being stupid now???????????????????
Feb 22 03:29:01 <Blondie101010>	tell me your problem and quit being STUPID
Feb 22 03:29:21 <hjf>	i have hosts in my network, which have hostnames, right?
Feb 22 03:29:33 <Blondie101010>	as every host yes
Feb 22 03:29:43 <Blondie101010>	how many days will this usually junk last?\
Feb 22 03:29:46 <hjf>	on dhcp v4 i have a list of leases which i can use to populate my DNS server
Feb 22 03:30:03 <Blondie101010>	yes I got that from the beginning, hence all my related comments
Feb 22 03:30:06 <hjf>	but with v6 there is no such list
Feb 22 03:30:09 <Blondie101010>	scroll up and reread!
Feb 22 03:30:12 <Blondie101010>	I know
Feb 22 03:30:19 <Blondie101010>	no magic
Feb 22 03:30:25 <hjf>	ok so, you know there is no such list
Feb 22 03:30:32 <Blondie101010>	indeed! stop
Feb 22 03:30:42 <hjf>	and you know my question was about adding a list to DNS
Feb 22 03:30:43 <Blondie101010>	just go set things up like you want
Feb 22 03:30:49 <Blondie101010>	yes
Feb 22 03:30:50 <hjf>	and you keep telling me to "configure dns"
Feb 22 03:30:50 <Blondie101010>	of course
Feb 22 03:30:56 <Blondie101010>	why would you set up a DNS server?
Feb 22 03:31:07 <hjf>	so again,
Feb 22 03:31:08 <Blondie101010>	to serve DNS
Feb 22 03:31:11 <Blondie101010>	gosh
Feb 22 03:31:16 <Blondie101010>	no I'm done with you!
Feb 22 03:31:22 <hjf>	Blondie101010: fuck you
Feb 22 03:31:24 <hjf>	ignored
Feb 22 03:31:53 <Blondie101010>	Allie mlu: I think I was pretty tolerant with that guy ^^
Feb 22 03:41:55 <RoyalYork__>	wow, i missed quite the live show
Feb 22 03:42:16 <Thuryn>	"I wouldn't say I've been *missing* it, Bob."  :D
Feb 22 03:42:23 <RoyalYork__>	dns this..... stupid that.....fucking this..... ignored that ..... :D
Feb 22 03:42:33 <Thuryn>	IRC in a nutshell
Feb 22 03:42:40 <RoyalYork__>	Ive been on IRC since 1997
Feb 22 03:42:42 <RoyalYork__>	nothings changed
Feb 22 03:42:48 <RoyalYork__>	except were all older and fatter now
Feb 22 03:42:54 <RoyalYork__>	the kiddos hang out discord now
Feb 22 03:42:59 <Thuryn>	hey! I've lost weight!
Feb 22 03:43:21 <RoyalYork__>	Thuryn, mazel
Feb 22 03:43:59 <Thuryn>	:D
Feb 22 03:44:11 <RoyalYork__>	i used to be an EFNet latchkey kid
Feb 22 03:44:26 <Thuryn>	EFNet is still around.  barely.
Feb 22 03:44:38 <tomman>	surprisingly EFNet still exists
Feb 22 03:44:44 <tomman>	but it's largely a ghost town these days
Feb 22 03:44:45 <RoyalYork__>	its a shawdow of its former self
Feb 22 03:44:46 <tomman>	just like Rizon
Feb 22 03:45:11 <tomman>	I do remember EFNet circa 2001, when I downloaded cracks and warez over dialup :D
Feb 22 03:45:26 <RoyalYork__>	EFNet... #Warez was +i forever and i never got in
Feb 22 03:45:40 <RoyalYork__>	#Oldwarez was the only place i could be
Feb 22 03:45:57 <tomman>	mostly cracks and GBA ROMs (remember when #gbatemp was a room and not a website yet?)
Feb 22 03:46:04 <tomman>	good ol' times~
Feb 22 03:46:16 <tomman>	fserves, unreliable download resuming, mIRC hacks...
Feb 22 03:46:31 <tomman>	and of course, 1KB/s downloads because my dialup sucked ass
Feb 22 03:46:35 <RoyalYork__>	fserves !list ! get.... oh the days of yore
Feb 22 03:46:44 <tomman>	@find
Feb 22 03:46:52 <tomman>	(Easy way to get banned from many channels!)
Feb 22 03:47:11 <Thuryn>	something something zmodem
Feb 22 03:47:17 <tomman>	Rizon was more or less the same, but 5 years later, and focused on anime
Feb 22 03:47:35 <Thuryn>	you can still send files over zmodem
Feb 22 03:47:42 <Thuryn>	sz from the termianl
Feb 22 03:47:57 <RoyalYork__>	any of you guys old school like me and go BBSing on a Commodore 64 back in the early 90s
Feb 22 03:48:11 <Thuryn>	i had a 386SX
Feb 22 03:48:12 <tomman>	some Seagate HDDs use zmodem too over the serial console port to transfer certain firmware modules
Feb 22 03:48:20 <Thuryn>	ran a WWIV BBS back then
Feb 22 03:48:38 <tomman>	I arrived waaaaaay past the heyday of BBS :/
Feb 22 03:49:34 <tomman>	2001: too late for BBS, too early for DSL
Feb 22 03:50:00 <RoyalYork__>	tomman, where did you live? We have cable internet then. Toronto
Feb 22 03:50:05 <Blondie101010>	I had cable then
Feb 22 03:50:12 <tomman>	RoyalYork__: Venezuela
Feb 22 03:50:15 <Blondie101010>	1-2 Mbps
Feb 22 03:50:28 <tomman>	my zone would not get DSL until 2003, and even then a credit card was mandatory
Feb 22 03:50:32 <tomman>	my mom refused to get one
Feb 22 03:50:34 <RoyalYork__>	tomman, i understand.... internet wasnt priority then was it
Feb 22 03:50:48 <tomman>	we would have to wait until 2005 when they dropped the credit card requirement
Feb 22 03:50:51 <Blondie101010>	it still shouldn't be one
Feb 22 03:51:09 <tomman>	cable Internet was not a thing here until the late '00s
Feb 22 03:51:16 <tomman>	and even then when it arrived, it was trash
Feb 22 03:51:35 <tomman>	it was trash from day one until late '22 when our sole DOCSIS provider pulled the plug
Feb 22 03:51:55 <tomman>	pricey, metered, slow, unreliable
Feb 22 03:52:13 <tomman>	and with all the fun stuff blocked (despite having no CGNAT jail back then)
Feb 22 03:52:50 <tomman>	also supposedly I would share the bandwidth with the entire street
Feb 22 03:53:45 <tomman>	(not sure how true was that, but that and many other reasons kept us away from cable Internet for good - DSL was good back then until the state telco left the entire infra fall into disrepair in the '10s)
Feb 22 03:54:40 <Blondie101010>	DOCSIS is organized in cells
Feb 22 03:54:59 <Blondie101010>	so yes you share bandwidth with your neighbours, but that should not be limiting if the network is well built
Feb 22 03:55:15 <tomman>	and there is the rub :)
Feb 22 03:55:26 <Blondie101010>	good ISPs will have like 400-1000 subs per cell while bad ones can have many thousands
Feb 22 03:55:34 <RoyalYork__>	speakng of DNS from earlier, do any of you crazy mofos run a public dns server
Feb 22 03:55:43 <Blondie101010>	yes
Feb 22 03:55:53 <tomman>	combine that with oversold service and a poorly maintained coax network, and well... I'm glad I got spared from that hell
Feb 22 03:55:54 <Thuryn>	yes.  multiple.
Feb 22 03:56:11 <RoyalYork__>	You guys worry about DNS poison or are you all DNSSEC up?
Feb 22 03:56:38 <Thuryn>	RoyalYork__, cache poisoning doesn't affect authoritative servers.
Feb 22 03:56:39 <tomman>	ha, my fiber telco is pestering me to pay the bill early
Feb 22 03:56:43 <Blondie101010>	that is covered for all HTTP already, so not a big concern
Feb 22 03:56:47 <tomman>	but they're incapable of sending an actual invoice!
Feb 22 03:57:19 <Blondie101010>	DNS poisonning wouldn't cheat HTTPS
Feb 22 03:57:43 <Blondie101010>	prevent DNS hacks is a bit limiting in some cases
Feb 22 03:58:10 <Blondie101010>	in some cases, you can't be too restrictive if you want clients
Feb 22 03:58:29 <RoyalYork__>	Blondie101010, what OS and daemon?
Feb 22 03:58:36 <Blondie101010>	I use bind9
Feb 22 03:58:44 <Jaxef>	Hi
Feb 22 03:58:52 <Blondie101010>	but also our GSLB
Feb 22 03:59:03 <Jaxef>	I wanted to learn how a likes counter works in a distributed system like twitter, facebook, youtube etc
Feb 22 03:59:06 <Jaxef>	anyone know?
Feb 22 03:59:12 <Jaxef>	Is it a buttom-up reduction approach?
Feb 22 03:59:24 <Jaxef>	where values are aggregated from leaf nodes up to the root of the tree. Each parent node combines the values of its children into a single value.
Feb 22 03:59:52 <Blondie101010>	Jaxef:  that's a complex topic and I suspect you'll have to spend many months reading prerequisite materials before you learn that part
Feb 22 04:00:19 <Blondie101010>	it would typically require a few years of professional dev
Feb 22 04:00:24 <Blondie101010>	experience
Feb 22 04:01:07 <RoyalYork__>	Blondie101010, come on??? Years??? We can solve this now. IF LIKEPRESS = TRUE LIKE++;
Feb 22 04:01:09 <RoyalYork__>	done
Feb 22 04:01:39 <Blondie101010>	if you run on a shared hosting system with only a few hundred visitors per day
Feb 22 04:02:01 <Blondie101010>	he asked for large scale
Feb 22 04:02:04 <RoyalYork__>	I was being glib
Feb 22 04:02:09 <Blondie101010>	ok
Feb 22 04:03:01 <RoyalYork__>	Jaxef, your query is beyond my pay grade. I wish I could be of more assitance
Feb 22 04:03:12 <Blondie101010>	and frankly I haven't seen many devs with less than 10 years of experience who could handle that task
Feb 22 04:03:14 <Jaxef>	real funny
Feb 22 04:03:25 <Blondie101010>	no jokes here
Feb 22 04:03:32 <superkuh>	Jaxef, this describes how youtube does it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIkhgagvrjI
Feb 22 04:03:38 <superkuh>	But it is not in super fine detail.
Feb 22 04:03:59 <superkuh>	Or, how they used to do it.
Feb 22 04:05:53 <Blondie101010>	that does not explain how it is counted in the distributed system
Feb 22 04:06:17 <Blondie101010>	lots of things will get proxied
Feb 22 04:07:46 <Blondie101010>	they do as much aggregation and caching closest to the end user
Feb 22 04:08:40 <Blondie101010>	s/as much/a lot of/
Feb 22 04:52:32 <Thuryn>	how to fail at upgrading a Cisco router:  follow Cisco's instructions
Feb 22 04:53:06 <Blondie101010>	why?  does it take too much RAM?
Feb 22 04:54:13 <Thuryn>	it goes into an infinite boot loop running and re-running the firmware updater
Feb 22 04:54:38 <Blondie101010>	it seems to be crashing
Feb 22 04:54:44 <Blondie101010>	can you access the logs?
Feb 22 04:55:22 <Thuryn>	nope.  wasn't a crash.  first time updated the firmware.  second time said "update not needed."  third time said "update not needed."  fourth time said "update not needed."
Feb 22 04:55:22 <Thuryn>	etc.
Feb 22 04:55:32 <Blondie101010>	mmm
Feb 22 04:55:45 <Thuryn>	had to interrupt the boot process and change the BOOT variable to point back to IOS.
Feb 22 04:55:54 <Thuryn>	then, of course, it started fine.
Feb 22 04:56:16 <Blondie101010>	ok so a bug in the update process
Feb 22 04:56:30 <Thuryn>	well, in the instructions.  they tell you to set the boot variable that way.
Feb 22 04:56:51 <Thuryn>	what they SHOULD tell you is execute "boot flash:updater.bin" but don't change the boot config.
Feb 22 04:57:12 <Blondie101010>	or how to change it back
Feb 22 04:57:22 <Blondie101010>	but that does seem like a flaw
Feb 22 04:57:43 <Thuryn>	yeah.  they don't say anything about breaking the boot sequence, and they *explicitly* tell you to set up the boot process this way.
Feb 22 04:58:10 <Thuryn>	it's weird.
Feb 22 04:58:28 <Thuryn>	but w/e.  I have a remote console server so it was no big deal.  Just annoying.
Feb 22 04:59:20 <Thuryn>	which reminds me.  i need to hook the UCS up to it...
Feb 22 07:33:28 <Daniel>	I am really having difficulties with ipv6 on some servers, after some time it just stops working, I have multiple IPv6 ips within the same netblock up on a server, but after some time some of them just stop working, I have to restart the networking service and it works, then again some IPv6 ips stop working, what could cause this behaviour?
Feb 22 07:34:54 <Daniel>	no logs, nothing happens, just stops working, why, I have no idea
Feb 22 07:35:23 <Affliction>	DHCPv6, SLAAC, or static? Perhaps something going wrong with renew if the former.
Feb 22 07:35:34 <Affliction>	well, multiple IPs, I assume static
Feb 22 07:35:34 <Daniel>	static IPv6
Feb 22 07:36:14 <Daniel>	the thing is the secondaries stop working (not all!) the main IPv6 never stops working
Feb 22 07:36:17 <Daniel>	it is really weird
Feb 22 07:36:40 <Affliction>	sending traffic outbound from those IPs doesn't help?
Feb 22 07:37:08 <Daniel>	not going out, I have to restart the network and it works
Feb 22 07:37:35 <Affliction>	same interface?
Feb 22 07:38:48 <Affliction>	If it recently started, I'd see if any of the communities using the same distro (which you've not yet specified) are having similar issues.
Feb 22 07:38:54 <Daniel>	Affliction: https://pastebin.com/dfnb9a4N commented the real IPs, you get it, its an almalinux 8 server
Feb 22 07:39:26 <Affliction>	Looks sane to me
Feb 22 07:40:14 <Daniel>	it is, thats what is driving me crazy
Feb 22 07:40:36 <Affliction>	Can't say I've noticed similar, albiet on rocky
Feb 22 07:42:21 <Daniel>	yeah its pretty damn weird and can't find a thing around about it.. :/
Feb 22 08:21:44 <Karyonix>	Really interesting & searching optimal value of FastSendDatagramThreshold?
Feb 22 08:22:02 <Karyonix>	1024, 1500, or 64000
Feb 22 09:07:50 <stallmanator>	Can somebody tell me how to get started with SDN? I think I get the idea but how do I actually play with it? Openflow or something? But I read that it's practically dead.
Feb 22 09:08:30 <mlu>	stallmanator: it's not well defined
Feb 22 09:08:46 <mlu>	stallmanator: SDN is more or less a marketing term similar to "cloud"
Feb 22 09:09:13 <dminuoso>	Not sure why you think Openflow is dead.
Feb 22 09:09:53 <stallmanator>	I read that on several reddit posts
Feb 22 09:10:13 <dminuoso>	It must be true if you found it on the internet.
Feb 22 09:10:36 <stallmanator>	Haha, good point
Feb 22 09:10:52 <stallmanator>	So are you suggesting I should try openflow (onos right?)
Feb 22 09:10:57 <dminuoso>	Put it this way, openflow is certainly not a hot growing topic.
Feb 22 09:11:49 <dminuoso>	There's a bunch of approaches you could all label SDN. We wrote what I dub an SDN compiler that takes a network description and compiles it into configuration that we provision our network infrastructure with. 
Feb 22 09:12:46 <dminuoso>	Under the hood we use VXLAN+EVPN rather than openflow, mostly because it satisfies our needs and gave us good hardware options.
Feb 22 09:13:30 <stallmanator>	Vxlan is that used to create virtual switches or something?
Feb 22 09:14:06 <dminuoso>	VXLAN is a red herring, honestly.
Feb 22 09:14:35 <dminuoso>	The principal idea is that you have a simple L3 underlay network over which you carry your described network.
Feb 22 09:14:50 <dminuoso>	So the packages in your described network must be packaged to be carried over that L3 underlay network.
Feb 22 09:15:35 <dminuoso>	VXLAN takes care of the packaging, EVPN encompasses a set of standards and technologies to exchange discovery of information
Feb 22 09:16:13 <dminuoso>	So in a way you can use EVPN to build an SDN solution with, much like you can use Openflow - except EVPN is more restrictive in what kind of networking you can accomplish.
Feb 22 09:18:29 <dminuoso>	In our case, you just declare a bunch of interfaces to participate in a VRF, then the SDN compiler will generate all the necessary configuration. EVPN will then help connect everything together while the packages between the interfaces will be VXLAN encapsulated and send according to some routing information (mediated by EVPN)
Feb 22 09:22:12 <stallmanator>	Vrf?
Feb 22 09:22:32 <stallmanator>	Oh
Feb 22 09:22:34 <stallmanator>	Nvm
Feb 22 09:23:52 <stallmanator>	I think I get some of what you're describing 
Feb 22 09:24:26 <stallmanator>	Not sure what all this complicated stuff is achieving
Feb 22 09:25:02 <dminuoso>	stallmanator: So we have a bunch of datacenters. Sometimes we want a server one rack and a server in another rack be able to talk to each other.
Feb 22 09:25:02 <dminuoso>	Or we have a server that just wants internet connectivity.
Feb 22 09:26:09 <stallmanator>	And these servers are not necessarily in the same datacenter right? Because otherwise it makes little sense
Feb 22 09:26:23 <dminuoso>	Maybe, maybe not, it does not matter.
Feb 22 09:27:42 <dminuoso>	Even within the same data center, its just effort that can go wrong.
Feb 22 09:28:21 <dminuoso>	Our approach has multiple considerations:
Feb 22 09:29:24 <dminuoso>	a) encapsulation: means the underlay cant see the packages, that simplifies architectural choices and we can carry different protocols (l2 or l3 routed traffic) over the same network.
Feb 22 09:29:36 <dminuoso>	and because its encapsulated, transporting l2 is safe, no risk of loops
Feb 22 09:30:19 <dminuoso>	b) horizontal scalability: we can just add switches and increase total throughput of the entire network, no hierarchial design with extremely expensive high performance switches or routers needed.
Feb 22 09:31:09 <dminuoso>	c) removing the human factor: no screwup in configuration, no bgp errors, no outages.
Feb 22 09:31:35 <dminuoso>	d) we have optimization potential, because at compilation time we know the hierarchy of the network, we can guide VXLAN/EVPN to carry traffic certain ways
Feb 22 09:31:59 <dminuoso>	e) we get to employ formal techniques to analyze the entire network for problems before we push it into configuration
Feb 22 09:33:51 <needle>	Nothing to add to this. Good explanation and a good plan.
Feb 22 09:35:26 <needle>	Maybe that such a EVPN/BGP fabric can be build using cheap pizza boxes routers, and everything is protocol based. Instead of using expencive one box highly redundant gear.
Feb 22 09:37:09 <needle>	and it is super scalable once set up.
Feb 22 09:38:28 <needle>	And cross-vendor. Not tied to a specific vendor.
Feb 22 09:39:51 <needle>	stallmanator: How to get started to SDN...
Feb 22 09:40:06 <dminuoso>	For us, we have reached the point where the server team can just do a bunch of clicks in netbox - and they get connectivity between two servers. Formally there is no network engineer involved anymore.
Feb 22 09:40:07 <needle>	stallmanator: Read about segment-routing
Feb 22 09:40:23 <needle>	stallmanator: SR and SRv6 that is your journey into "SDN".
Feb 22 09:40:55 <needle>	stallmanator: https://www.segment-routing.net/ it is vendor agnostic technology
Feb 22 09:41:12 <needle>	https://www.segment-routing.net/ietf
Feb 22 09:41:33 <needle>	enjoy
Feb 22 09:42:36 <dminuoso>	Also check out MPLS (which is where segment routing sort of originated out of, and also where EVPN is from)
Feb 22 09:42:55 *	needle nods
Feb 22 09:44:03 <dminuoso>	For us, network engineering has little to do with configuring network equipment anymore. Instead, we are mostly busy with writing software that configures equipment to achieve networking properties.
Feb 22 09:48:50 <sittingduck>	Gone are the days when we used to crimp a couple of connectors and call it a day. 
Feb 22 09:50:02 <agent314>	i'm sure there's gonna be plenty of stuff to do in hardware :)
Feb 22 09:50:17 <dminuoso>	Sure, I mean the entire physical work is still there.
Feb 22 09:50:18 <agent314>	like for example, setup meshes 
Feb 22 09:50:33 <dminuoso>	Though a spine/leaf architecture removes *much* of labor.
Feb 22 09:50:47 <dminuoso>	It places it all ahead of time, but because of uniformity its fast and easy.
Feb 22 09:51:14 <agent314>	at some point i bet networking jobs and energy jobs will get squeezed into one
Feb 22 09:51:25 <dminuoso>	Our spine/leaf fabric is what allows us to not patch cross connects every day.
Feb 22 09:51:58 <agent314>	so you not only have to setup a mesh of devices but also figure out appropriate passive energy source: light, wind, vibration, noise, water, whatever
Feb 22 09:52:58 <agent314>	what i'm worried more about is what's going to happen with satellite communications
Feb 22 09:54:40 <agent314>	from one point i am totally for skylink, from another i feel like this is going to end up with us remembering good old days when we could go into space and wouldn't be imprisoned by a bunch of space trash
Feb 22 09:57:59 <agent314>	sorry going off-topic there
Feb 22 11:34:24 <javi404>	nothing like waking up to racoons attacking your chickens
Feb 22 11:34:26 <javi404>	fuck me
Feb 22 11:48:17 <nullvalue>	wow
Feb 22 11:48:29 <nullvalue>	are racoons carnivores
Feb 22 12:04:31 <stallmanator>	needle: thank you!
Feb 22 12:08:05 <djph>	nullvalue: omnivore
Feb 22 12:12:12 <nullvalue>	i was trynna remember that word but it slipped my mind thanks 
Feb 22 13:03:25 <realivanjx>	does scp verify file integrity? i am trying to transfer a file via scp (remote is windows 11 with openssh server installed) but i always get corrupted file.
Feb 22 13:03:54 <grawity>	over network, it relies on ssh's encryption layer to detect any packet corruption
Feb 22 13:03:56 <grawity>	other than that – no
Feb 22 13:04:24 <realivanjx>	weird. all the files i am trying to transfer from the windows 11 to my ubuntu is always corrupted. tried zip, docx, etc
Feb 22 13:06:25 <realivanjx>	if i try to transfer from linux to windows 11 it is fine
Feb 22 13:06:42 <grawity>	what tools are you using to do the transfer? which side is the client?
Feb 22 13:06:57 <realivanjx>	but windows 11 to linux it is corrupted. just tried to transfer a png file and half of the image is garbled
Feb 22 13:07:21 <realivanjx>	ubuntu is just regular scp. windows is openssh server from the additional features menu
Feb 22 13:07:32 <grawity>	okay, so you're pulling the files to ubuntu
Feb 22 13:07:38 <realivanjx>	yes
Feb 22 13:08:02 <grawity>	which version of "regular scp", the new one that uses SFTP by default or the older one that sitll uses actual SCP?
Feb 22 13:08:43 <realivanjx>	how to get the scp version in command line? i never done that
Feb 22 13:09:06 <grawity>	for the package version, dpkg -S `which scp`
Feb 22 13:09:11 <grawity>	for the openssh version, ssh -V
Feb 22 13:09:59 <grawity>	oh right I guess dpkg -S just tells you the package name, not the version
Feb 22 13:10:00 <realivanjx>	ubuntu: OpenSSH_9.3p1 Ubuntu-1ubuntu3.2, OpenSSL 3.0.10 1 Aug 2023
Feb 22 13:10:16 <realivanjx>	windows: OpenSSH_for_Windows_8.6p1, LibreSSL 3.4.3
Feb 22 13:10:33 <grawity>	hmm, does it have the scp -O option?
Feb 22 13:10:36 <realivanjx>	on ubuntu i just use whatever the ubuntu 23.10 gave me
Feb 22 13:10:46 <realivanjx>	no
Feb 22 13:11:46 <grawity>	it should, that was added in 9.0...
Feb 22 13:11:51 <realivanjx>	the connection between the windows and ubuntu is over wireguard half a world away if that matter
Feb 22 13:12:09 <grawity>	can you try 1) pulling a file with `scp -O`
Feb 22 13:12:12 <realivanjx>	i am utterly confused right now
Feb 22 13:12:24 <grawity>	2) installing putty-tools, then pulling a file with `pscp -scp`
Feb 22 13:12:29 <grawity>	3) pulling a file with `pscp -sftp`
Feb 22 13:13:35 <realivanjx>	this is the command i was using: scp my-laptop:./Desktop/a.png .
Feb 22 13:13:44 <realivanjx>	my-laptop is defined in .ssh/config
Feb 22 13:13:56 <realivanjx>	so just: scp -O my-laptop:./Desktop/a.png .  ?
Feb 22 13:14:07 <grawity>	okay, then try the command 1) "scp -O my-laptop:./Desktop/a.png ." 2)
Feb 22 13:14:09 <grawity>	actually
Feb 22 13:14:16 <grawity>	can you first show your definition from .ssh/config
Feb 22 13:14:29 <realivanjx>	just a Host and Username
Feb 22 13:14:40 <grawity>	no tty-related settings anywhere?
Feb 22 13:14:40 <realivanjx>	but username has space
Feb 22 13:14:50 <realivanjx>	but i can ssh just fine into the windows cmd
Feb 22 13:15:10 <realivanjx>	nothing besides those two i have said. i dont even understand the config that much
Feb 22 13:15:17 <grawity>	okay then
Feb 22 13:15:26 <grawity>	start with testing "scp -O my-laptop:./Desktop/a.png ."
Feb 22 13:15:32 <grawity>	and check if that gets corrupted as well
Feb 22 13:15:56 <realivanjx>	what does -O do
Feb 22 13:16:05 <grawity>	tells it to use SCP
Feb 22 13:16:16 <nullvalue>	heeh
Feb 22 13:16:19 <grawity>	(like `man scp` says)
Feb 22 13:16:26 <realivanjx>	okay now it works
Feb 22 13:16:28 <realivanjx>	thanks a lot
Feb 22 13:16:34 <grawity>	that's really weird then
Feb 22 13:16:55 <realivanjx>	i thought scp command line uses the same connection type
Feb 22 13:17:07 <grawity>	older versions did
Feb 22 13:17:16 <grawity>	but it's a.... really crusty protocol
Feb 22 13:17:21 <realivanjx>	i regularly use scp but between my ubuntu and my windows virtual machine hosted inside the same ubuntu 
Feb 22 13:17:29 <grawity>	so in openssh 9.0, the command was ported to use SFTP instead
Feb 22 13:17:29 <realivanjx>	damn need to make it default then
Feb 22 13:17:37 <djph>	isn't it all sftp under the hood since somewhere in the later part of 8.x or 9.0?
Feb 22 13:17:49 <grawity>	apt-get install putty-tools and check if "pscp -sftp user@laptop:./Desktop/a.png ." has the same prob
Feb 22 13:18:20 <realivanjx>	i dont use putty on linux since i dont see the benefit of it but i will just use scp -O from now on
Feb 22 13:18:50 <grawity>	well fuck off then, I'm not going to waste my time on this
Feb 22 13:19:14 <grawity>	if you don't care why it's broken then I'm not going to try fixing it either
Feb 22 13:19:50 <realivanjx>	well without -O is using older protocol so thats that
Feb 22 13:19:59 <grawity>	that's literally the exact opposite of what I said
Feb 22 13:20:32 <grawity>	>       -O      Use the legacy SCP protocol for file transfers instead of the SFTP protocol. 
Feb 22 13:20:45 <grawity>	*with* -O it's using the older protocol
Feb 22 13:21:52 <realivanjx>	does putty even support .ssh/config file?
Feb 22 13:22:04 <realivanjx>	my username has spaces so i cant exactly run it on cli with scp for example
Feb 22 13:22:09 <grawity>	oh come on
Feb 22 13:22:17 <grawity>	ssh "word word word@hostname"
Feb 22 13:22:35 <grawity>	the same way you handle files with spaces, etc
Feb 22 13:22:47 <realivanjx>	nope https://askubuntu.com/questions/774919/escape-username-spaces-in-scp
Feb 22 13:23:19 <realivanjx>	im not that dumb with command line i tried that
Feb 22 13:23:34 <grawity>	that's for scp, I'm asking you to try a program that is not scp
Feb 22 13:25:17 <grawity>	you know what, it doesn't matter, I'm going to guess it's a windows openssh bug and point you at https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases for a newer version
Feb 22 13:25:39 <realivanjx>	pscp sftp works fine
Feb 22 13:26:05 <realivanjx>	maybe my ubuntu scp just decided to mess with me
Feb 22 13:35:09 <grawity>	does the ubuntu sftp command do the same then

Feb 22 15:18:54 *	ChanServ gives voice to Cowclops
Feb 22 15:19:04 <Cowclops>	score one for proxmox
Feb 22 15:19:14 <Cowclops>	it has letsencrypt cert validation built in
Feb 22 15:19:22 <Cowclops>	as opposed to vmware which i'm pretty sure that just isn't an option
Feb 22 15:36:08 <CrtxReavr>	Any bets on whether his cell network outage has a state actor behind it?
Feb 22 15:37:32 <dmuppet>	Doubtful. My money is on overworked undertrained stimpy pushing bad configs. 
Feb 22 15:37:52 <dmuppet>	Although the longer this goes on the more my mind changes. 
Feb 22 15:41:54 <synthmeat>	there were two x class flares last 24h. dunno. they're usually one or two a month, but i'm not sure are they usually in "quick" succession like this
Feb 22 15:42:36 <dmuppet>	Yeah but x class flares don't discriminate. Would affect more than just AT&T. 
Feb 22 15:43:41 <baldpope>	good morning all - i'm trying to find an internet health map from likely way back - it was a collection of core providers and their up/down reporting along with latency metrics (and more) - but cannot seem to find it in the pile of shit that's out there today
Feb 22 15:43:54 <baldpope>	does anyone know of a good isp/carrier health dashboard?
Feb 22 15:44:36 <djph>	what was it ... downdetector?
Feb 22 15:45:13 <djph>	or thousandeyes
Feb 22 15:45:39 <baldpope>	no, it wasn't them - it was (from memory) a fairly basic UI that showed all the carriers (mci/att/etc..) that showed the latencies between the various carriers
Feb 22 15:46:27 <baldpope>	like a 16x16 grid or something - but for the life of me I cannot remember the name of the site
Feb 22 15:49:55 <dmuppet>	There was internetpulse.net but that got shutdown. 
Feb 22 15:51:05 <dmuppet>	Used to look like this. https://prnt.sc/8GWVhrT8EaeE
Feb 22 15:51:33 <dmuppet>	baldpope ^
Feb 22 15:52:52 <sittingduck>	dmuppet: quite a fancy old-school UI. 
Feb 22 15:52:55 <baldpope>	dmuppet, that looks a lot closer to what I was thinking
Feb 22 15:55:01 <baldpope>	dmuppet, any idea why they got shut down?
Feb 22 15:55:52 <dmuppet>	Nope. 
Feb 22 16:13:27 <CrtxReavr>	Unless it was laden with ads (sucked), it was likely someone's pet project and they lost interest in continuing it.
Feb 22 16:17:06 <baldpope>	I don't recall it being heavily laden with ads, could very well have been a pet project by someone
Feb 22 16:17:26 <baldpope>	the image linked by dmuppet is what I remember
Feb 22 16:17:28 <test924>	does dialup modem work over voip?
Feb 22 16:18:05 <baldpope>	it's not dissimilar to fax over voip, so if you attached a proper analog terminator, it might
Feb 22 16:18:36 <CrtxReavr>	Might work. . . but certainly not a good idea.
Feb 22 16:18:46 <baldpope>	test924, what's your use case?
Feb 22 16:19:56 <test924>	it's more a curiosoity but i don't see how it makes a difference
Feb 22 16:20:53 <baldpope>	assuming you had an adapter that terminated with an analog port, it's possible it would work - we have analog adapters for some of our old fax equipment at work, and they work fine
Feb 22 16:21:06 <dmuppet>	analog and voip have pretty big differences - mostly the codecs. 
Feb 22 16:21:45 <dmuppet>	You probably could get it to work but I'm not sure it would work that well even in dial-up standards. 
Feb 22 16:22:21 <baldpope>	we used to have this from vonage
Feb 22 16:22:22 <baldpope>	https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cata/186_188/3_2_3/english/quick/guide/QSG8688.html
Feb 22 16:23:19 <test924>	"Modems (and fax) over VoIP are extremely sensitive to timing, and usually break over VoIP, it might even seem to work at first, but it's certain to break." from https://serverfault.com/questions/99903/how-can-i-simulate-a-modem-over-a-voip-connection
Feb 22 16:23:46 *	baldpope nod
Feb 22 16:24:10 <dmuppet>	Yeah - you basically need a voip deployment specifically designed to handle dial-up. 
Feb 22 16:25:36 <test924>	does anyone else find it sad that POTSis going away?
Feb 22 16:25:57 <dmuppet>	HELL. FUCKING. NO.
Feb 22 16:26:11 <baldpope>	not sure sad is the word I'd use, but yes - from a nostalgia view
Feb 22 16:26:17 <another|>	Don't do POTs kids!
Feb 22 16:26:40 <dmuppet>	If I never see another 66/110 punchdown again in my life it will be too soon. 
Feb 22 16:28:19 <mercenary>	Sad that what replaces it is not held to the same reliability standards
Feb 22 16:28:24 <baldpope>	dmuppet, while I concur about 66 punch down blocks (seriously fuck those) using cat5 against a 110panel and carrying analog over isn't as bad as it might sound - thankfully we've migrated everything over to voip, but only fairly recently (about 2 years now)
Feb 22 16:28:50 <nullvalue>	:P
Feb 22 16:30:15 <FH_thecat>	how can I bring up lo interface in linux, without running scrips in /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/ ?
Feb 22 16:30:27 <baldpope>	ifconfig lo up
Feb 22 16:31:24 <baldpope>	or ip link set lo up
Feb 22 16:32:59 <dmuppet>	Just gotta whisper in it's ear. It will get up for sure ;)
Feb 22 16:33:01 <FH_thecat>	baldpope: thank you
Feb 22 16:33:10 <dmuppet>	or what baldope said. 
Feb 22 17:16:24 <javi404>	word on the street is the wireless networks are down.
Feb 22 17:17:34 <baldpope>	javi404, primarily AT&T from what I've seen
Feb 22 17:17:54 <tomman>	finally, got my network inventory (sorry, no pics)
Feb 22 17:17:55 <Thuryn>	t-mobile here seems to be fine
Feb 22 17:18:03 <tomman>	the whole setup is surprisingly "simple"
Feb 22 17:18:14 <tomman>	two rooms, two racks
Feb 22 17:18:35 <tomman>	they dumped one of their fiber ISPs due to frequent outages, so they're now down to one
Feb 22 17:18:47 <tomman>	the main router is this: https://i.mt.lv/cdn/product_files/hEX_161115.pdf
Feb 22 17:18:57 <tomman>	none of the switches are managed!
Feb 22 17:19:35 <tomman>	Room 1 has the main router and 3 switches (Two gigabit TP-Stinks and a 100Mbit rebadged Lanpro), it serves half of the building
Feb 22 17:19:39 <baldpope>	tomman, whatchutalkingaboutwillis ?
Feb 22 17:19:48 <tomman>	my current gig, I guess :D
Feb 22 17:20:17 <tomman>	Room 2 has a couple more 100Mbit switches (that have been repaired countless times), but no routers or anything like that
Feb 22 17:20:28 <tomman>	so I guess my customer is on the market for new managed switches
Feb 22 17:20:40 <tomman>	today is a good day to learn how to VLAN, I guess
Feb 22 17:21:11 <Thuryn>	recommend procurves or juniper EX/FX
Feb 22 17:21:12 <tomman>	cabling is a tangled unlabeled mess, as expected - the IT slaves were "due to label them in any moment soon"
Feb 22 17:21:20 <tomman>	but didn't so because "we have no labels"
Feb 22 17:21:35 <tomman>	told them to improvise with paper and tape, so they had to beg to borrow a roll of tape :D
Feb 22 17:21:39 <baldpope>	can also recommend juniper ex - quite happy with my (now deprecated) ex4200s
Feb 22 17:21:50 <tomman>	Well, it's going to be whatever we can find here
Feb 22 17:21:56 <tomman>	possibly locally
Feb 22 17:22:00 <Thuryn>	recommend brady labeller and 3/4" black on white nylon labels
Feb 22 17:22:01 <baldpope>	tomman, where are you?
Feb 22 17:22:02 <tomman>	which most likely means moar TP-Stink
Feb 22 17:22:09 <tomman>	baldpope: Venezuela
Feb 22 17:22:58 <tomman>	ooof, a Juniper EX is $2K+
Feb 22 17:23:08 <javi404>	baldpope: i was busy saving my chickens all night from a racoon, missed the news this morning. lol.
Feb 22 17:23:32 <Thuryn>	tomman, worth it.  they are highly capable and last a long time
Feb 22 17:23:49 <tomman>	the problem is that this is a government customer in a commie country
Feb 22 17:23:51 <Thuryn>	you won't have to replace it in three years
Feb 22 17:24:03 <tomman>	they will balk at the price tag because you can buy plenty of bribes with that :D
Feb 22 17:24:24 <tomman>	Gonna add them to the list anyway
Feb 22 17:24:28 <javi404>	baldpope: i have a T-Mobile etc 5G tower near me, 300Mbps down, 1.5Mbps up.
Feb 22 17:24:40 <tomman>	Oh, I spotted some dead 3Com and Cisco Catalyst Express switches too
Feb 22 17:24:57 <baldpope>	tomman, second hand ex switches from ebay maybe save a few bucks
Feb 22 17:25:04 <tomman>	no eBay in Venezuela
Feb 22 17:25:10 <tomman>	also this is a government customer
Feb 22 17:25:17 <tomman>	they can't buy second hand, or online like us do
Feb 22 17:25:34 <baldpope>	is venezuela on non-export list?
Feb 22 17:25:36 <tomman>	all I can tell them is "it would be nice if you buy this"
Feb 22 17:25:55 <tomman>	baldpope: more or less
Feb 22 17:26:12 <tomman>	government here is under sanctions, so it isn't like we can take the phone and ring Juniper
Feb 22 17:26:17 <tomman>	they can't directly
Feb 22 17:26:27 <Thuryn>	ah, layer 9
Feb 22 17:26:34 <baldpope>	eh - possibly some ubiquiti gear? (limited experience with their wifi gear, so far so good
Feb 22 17:26:36 <Thuryn>	that makes it messy
Feb 22 17:26:43 <javi404>	tomman: ship it to me, ill send it there (and probably put myself on some kind of federal gov agency watch list) lol.
Feb 22 17:26:46 <tomman>	(it's not as draconian as "MUST NOT EXPORT TO CHINA UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES", tho - a middleman is expected here)
Feb 22 17:27:08 <tomman>	this is why I'm saying "most likely all roads point to TP-Stink"
Feb 22 17:27:30 <baldpope>	years back - i was working selling firetrucks and parts/accessories/etc...
Feb 22 17:27:35 <Thuryn>	anybody here using splunk?  the #splunk channel is a graveyard.
Feb 22 17:28:05 <tomman>	Hmm, looks like there are some Ubiquiti sellers here
Feb 22 17:28:14 <baldpope>	had a call come in for a radiator for one of our old old old trucks, got it quoted out and had to deliver it to a local office - was like wtf? - turns out they were (illegally?) exporting to some overseas country
Feb 22 17:28:19 <tomman>	Need: 16/24 ports, gigabit, managed, can do VLANs, no POE
Feb 22 17:28:35 <tomman>	would need at least 5 switches
Feb 22 17:28:53 <baldpope>	tomman, the ubiquiti would meet your needs - and the unifi controller software is actually surprisingly decent
Feb 22 17:28:57 <tomman>	saw 4 active, so having one or two spares would be fine
Feb 22 17:29:16 <tomman>	The 'tik hEX routerbox can stay
Feb 22 17:29:19 <baldpope>	and it's affordable (I would consider it prosumer, but not commercial or enterprise)
Feb 22 17:29:22 <tomman>	"Made in Latvia™2
Feb 22 17:29:40 <baldpope>	they do also have commercial gear, but I haven't used any of it
Feb 22 17:29:47 <tomman>	also spotted an ancient WR841ND on top of that mess
Feb 22 17:30:38 <tomman>	I suspect there will be more hidden WLAN APs that haven't been disclosed to me yet, but the focus right now is to get this wired mess sorted out first
Feb 22 17:34:32 <tomman>	bah, the UniFi datasheets on switches don't tell me anything about VLANs
Feb 22 17:34:48 <tomman>	the install instructions do mention something something cellphone app something
Feb 22 17:36:25 <tomman>	also... why in the hell I want a COLOR TOUCHSCREEN on a switch!?
Feb 22 17:37:14 <tomman>	but if I could get this specs mess sorted out, these could do  - they cost much less than the Junipers... but the managed TP-Stinks are cheaper
Feb 22 17:41:20 <tomman>	anyway, I need to sort out a list of candidates to hand to the customer next Monday
Feb 22 17:41:23 <tomman>	"here, buy this"
Feb 22 17:49:50 <javi404>	my wife has ATT, i have Tmo, i called, she answered and told me she would call me back. all seems ok now. lol

Feb 22 18:35:17 *	Topic for #networking set by Allie!sid292248@libera/staff/allie (Sun Jan 14 11:49:30 2024)
Feb 22 19:00:32 <tomman>	OK, the more I read about VLANs, the more and more I get confused
Feb 22 19:01:12 <tomman>	I can see how VLANs isolate segments of a LAN, that one is clear to me
Feb 22 19:01:29 <tomman>	and that's basically the whole point of what I need to achieve on this project
Feb 22 19:01:33 <tomman>	but...
Feb 22 19:01:56 <tomman>	I still need my workstations to access both common LAN shared resources (say, a server), and of course, the Internet
Feb 22 19:02:12 <tomman>	they just must not communicate with hosts outside their respective segments
Feb 22 19:04:04 <tomman>	can I achieve that with some specific kind of VLAN (I've seen several implementations so far on the same hardware), or do I need to get routers involved too?
Feb 22 19:05:16 <minimal>	tomman: "they just must not communicate with hosts outside their respective segments", "do I need to get routers involved" - routers are used to communicate outside of a VLAN subnet, you said you don't want that
Feb 22 19:05:58 <tomman>	My case is: let's say I have Department A and Department B, there is Server X and of course The Internet.
Feb 22 19:06:12 <tomman>	Department A must be able to reach Server X and the Internet, but not hosts at Department B
Feb 22 19:06:24 <tomman>	likewise with B: X and The Internet are fair game, but A is off-limits
Feb 22 19:06:38 <minimal>	it is nothing to do with "Departments", it is about IP subnets
Feb 22 19:06:48 <tomman>	I assume each department will end with its own subnet
Feb 22 19:07:04 <minimal>	if you want to design it that way...
Feb 22 19:07:29 <tomman>	I'm open to ideas, this is mostly uncharted territory to me (and to the IT clowns I'll be working with for the rest of the year)
Feb 22 19:07:45 <minimal>	VLANs basically work the same way as physical LANs
Feb 22 19:08:15 <minimal>	for each (v)lan you have 1 or more subnets (i.e. 1 IPv4, 1 IPv6 if you're using that)
Feb 22 19:08:53 <minimal>	traffic between (v)lan subnets require a router that is attached to multiple (v)lans
Feb 22 19:09:45 <tomman>	OK, so that means I need a VLAN-aware router too.
Feb 22 19:10:13 <tomman>	not just the switches
Feb 22 19:11:22 <minimal>	well typically a router would be connected to a "trunk" switch port
Feb 22 19:11:46 <minimal>	you have a router that doesn't understand VLANs?
Feb 22 19:11:46 <tomman>	that's a word I've seen mentioned many times in the literature I'm reading, yes
Feb 22 19:11:59 <tomman>	At this stage we have NOTHING
Feb 22 19:12:03 <tomman>	we will start from scratch
Feb 22 19:12:20 <tomman>	the current network is "a bunch of dumb switches and a RouterBoard"
Feb 22 19:12:52 <minimal>	you don't strictly need to have a VLAN-aware router, you could connect multiple router interfaces to the switch with each switch port being for a specific VLAN....but that's not something typially done
Feb 22 19:13:14 <tomman>	ha, I was thinking on that :D
Feb 22 19:13:31 <minimal>	but if for example you want to have 50 VLANs then you'd need a router with 50 ethernet interfaces lol
Feb 22 19:13:58 <tomman>	Fortunately in this case I already identified that we won't need more than 4 or 5 VLANs
Feb 22 19:14:03 <minimal>	whereas typically you'd have a single ethernet interface connected to a single trunk switch port
Feb 22 19:16:07 <minimal>	"the current network is "a bunch of dumb switches and a RouterBoard" - but you're not talking about the current network, you're talking about changing to new VLAN-capable switches etc
Feb 22 19:16:25 <tomman>	yeah, hence why my "we're starting from scratch" remark
Feb 22 19:16:30 <tomman>	right now we have nothing
Feb 22 19:16:36 <tomman>	just a blank canvas
Feb 22 19:17:59 <minimal>	so then you should really get a VLAN capable router
Feb 22 19:19:18 <tomman>	OK, I COULD salvage the Routerboard they have right now, if it has the right feature set for that
Feb 22 19:19:32 <tomman>	it's a RB750Gr3
Feb 22 19:19:47 <tomman>	otherwise I'll tell them to "buy something else on top of the switches"
Feb 22 19:22:27 <tomman>	ha, now I need to pick between "IEEE 802.1Q", "Cisco VTP" and "something else"
Feb 22 19:25:39 <minimal>	tomman: sounds like you need to spend some time reading docs about VLANs to actually understand it
Feb 22 19:25:54 <tomman>	yeah, that's what I'll be doing for the next few days
Feb 22 19:26:00 <tomman>	again, this is completely new to me
Feb 22 19:26:31 <minimal>	so then why are your making recommendations to someone about something you don't (currently) understand?
Feb 22 19:26:54 <tomman>	They have no other options
Feb 22 19:27:05 <tomman>	again, I got involved on this for $RAISNS
Feb 22 19:28:31 <minimal>	and you're not concerned that you might make incorrect recommendations based on not (fully) understanding things?
Feb 22 19:28:56 <tomman>	I'm well aware of that, and they are also well aware of that too
Feb 22 19:29:03 <tomman>	they still want to continue with this anyway
Feb 22 19:32:38 <Cowclops>	Oof, I've told the developer at work like 4 different ways that i have no idea what he's trying to do and its not my area of expertise and he won't stop blowing up my slack
Feb 22 19:32:54 <Cowclops>	::wall of text code:: why does this particular way of accessing an smb share error out
Feb 22 19:33:02 <Cowclops>	I. DON'T. KNOW. 
Feb 22 19:33:08 <Cowclops>	"what if i try this different wall of text"
Feb 22 19:33:11 <Cowclops>	Still don't know
Feb 22 19:33:46 <Cowclops>	Not a coder. I just checked to make sure he's running it in a way that has read permissions to what he's trying to access, andh e does
Feb 22 19:33:57 <Cowclops>	on the flip side, proxmox has been workin great for me
Feb 22 19:36:57 <minimal>	"Man: Doctor it hurts when I do 'this'. Doctor: Ok, don't do that" ;-)
Feb 22 19:40:25 <Cowclops>	of course i'm not just refusing to help with a complex question, its more like i'm the worst person to ask why your code doesn't work
Feb 22 19:41:51 <minimal>	I assume they're expecting you get out Wireshark, capture SMB/CIFS traffic from/to their app and diagnose why things aren't working from that lol
Feb 22 19:43:32 <rpifan>	so there an application that has a fixed domain name on it, it uses this name to send log data. we are migrating the server the server that it sends to but it needs to be under a new name, ideally we'd keep both servers connected to get the data. is there a way to accomplish that? maybe using nginx redirection or some kind of fancy ip trick?
Feb 22 19:46:42 <elf>	can the application send log data to multiple destinations simultaneously? eg as syslog can
Feb 22 19:47:11 <elf>	if so, build the new log server, merge the two log sets after the fact
Feb 22 19:47:49 <rpifan>	afaik i dont think so, it seems the application pushes data to our sentry instance
Feb 22 19:47:51 <rpifan>	using a token
Feb 22 19:47:56 <elf>	or you could get all fancy with some sort of load balancing / distributed log forwarder in front of the multiple log servers if HA is that important
Feb 22 19:48:31 <rpifan>	nah this is meant to be a temporary solution until the log errors match up in the new server.
Feb 22 19:48:37 <rpifan>	since we can't migrate all of the old logs
Feb 22 19:49:24 <elf>	well... maybe you just need to be really quick when swapping the IP from the old -> new log server :)
Feb 22 19:50:47 <tomman>	ha, the user manual of the TP-Stink managed switches have exactly the "different departments" usecase I actually need
Feb 22 19:52:36 <elf>	tomman, typically most orgs have a router with firewall functionality and an interface in each subnet/vlan
Feb 22 19:52:37 <Allie>	tomman: it's almost as if they're quite good switches for the right usecase :D
Feb 22 19:53:28 <tomman>	it's kinda barebones, but the explanation seems relatively simple to grasp
Feb 22 19:54:40 <tomman>	ah, "trunk port" is a "tagged port" in non-Cisco-ese
Feb 22 19:54:46 <tomman>	--Cisco-ese
Feb 22 19:54:58 <tomman>	of course there had to be Cisco and non-Cisco lingo for the same shit
Feb 22 19:58:42 <tomman>	"access" = untagged port = plug computers here
Feb 22 19:59:01 <tomman>	"trunk" = tagged port = plug VLAN-aware switches and routers here
Feb 22 19:59:06 <tomman>	OK, I now understand that part
Feb 22 19:59:11 <tomman>	tagged vs. untagged.
Feb 22 20:04:49 <rpifan>	yea
Feb 22 20:05:00 <rpifan>	or i wonder if i can just set a dns to change the name from the old to the new
Feb 22 20:05:19 <baldpope>	tomman, trunk -> also for servers that are multi-homed
Feb 22 20:05:52 <baldpope>	one of our monitoring boxes is a VM that has no gateway (well 1, but not 7) and sits on 8 different nets running dhcpd/arpwatch 
Feb 22 20:09:54 <elf>	rpifan, yeah
Feb 22 20:19:43 <edgars>	yyyyo!
Feb 22 20:27:40 <mzoku>	hello, is there a way to check A record history with dig?  
Feb 22 20:28:16 <djph>	"history" ? like "what was it 3 hours ago" ?
Feb 22 20:28:35 <mzoku>	I mean how many times A record has been changed in the dns zone / ns
Feb 22 20:28:45 <mzoku>	within an year for example
Feb 22 20:29:51 <edgars>	no
Feb 22 20:30:09 <edgars>	some services like netcraft was collecting data
Feb 22 20:31:26 <tomman>	looks like the RB750Gr3 can do VLANs too (they're not exactly trivial to setup, but can be done), so looks like we're set
Feb 22 20:31:40 <mzoku>	ok

Feb 22 21:43:48 <ZedHedTed>	so...that AT&T outage was "fun" huh?
Feb 22 21:53:25 <rustyaxe>	was? :P we still have AT&T devices unreachable :o
Feb 22 21:57:04 <ZedHedTed>	mine's been fine since 12:30pm ET
Feb 22 22:02:08 <Reventlov>	what outage ?
Feb 22 22:04:57 <rustyaxe>	apparently someone unplugged the wrong box
Feb 22 22:06:54 <catphish>	i tripped over the AT&T cable, they're still trying to fix it
Feb 22 22:10:49 <ZedHedTed>	it'd sure be nice if i didn't have to pay for today's part of the bill :P
Feb 22 22:11:08 <ZedHedTed>	after all, if i forgot to meet my end of the bargain, they'd cut my service ASAP
Feb 22 22:12:43 <tomman>	ah, cellular outages
Feb 22 22:12:47 <tomman>	be glad you don't live here
Feb 22 22:13:04 <tomman>	(we had one yesterday, one of our 3 telcos was not having a good day dealing with SMS at all)
Feb 22 22:21:07 <ZedHedTed>	the US sucks :P
Feb 22 22:21:23 <ZedHedTed>	tmobile+sprint merged months after i left tmobile due to their frequent outages
Feb 22 22:22:09 <ZedHedTed>	mobile ISPs have little competition as it is, but cable/fiber ISPs are even worse. comcast has dibs on entire towns.
Feb 22 22:22:29 <ZedHedTed>	and comcast is universally hated. a lack of competition tends to make companies worse.
Feb 22 22:23:53 *	rustyaxe slaps ZedHedTed with his kalashnikov. USA is way better than the shithole this thing and i come from :o
Feb 22 22:24:40 <tomman>	ZedHedTed: I'll trade your Comcasts and AT&Ts for our lovely CANTV
Feb 22 22:24:46 <tomman>	story time!
Feb 22 22:25:11 <tomman>	my uncles live in the capital city, they found themselves this week without a phone line anymore
Feb 22 22:25:45 <tomman>	turns out some aging equipment finally went poof, and CANTV's answer was "well, thanks for all the fish, you're no longer our customers, fuck you and vote Maduro"
Feb 22 22:25:58 <tomman>	"we're deploying fiber but not this decade in your zone"
Feb 22 22:26:06 <tomman>	they're now scrambling to find a fiber ISP that doesn't suck
Feb 22 22:26:47 <tomman>	(plenty of options, but finding one that has wired up 1) their zone, and 2) their apartment buildings gonna be fun)
Feb 22 22:27:33 <tomman>	decades old phone lines, GONE in a flash
Feb 22 22:27:51 <tomman>	at least they were "nice" enough to cancel the contract instead of billing dead lines forever (which is the usual here)
Feb 22 22:31:58 <ZedHedTed>	rustyaxe: maybe so, but russia (if i inferred correctly) isn't getting invaded by illegals or going woke last i checked

Feb 23 00:07:30 <Cowclops>	my denver based IT friend was talking about how AT&T was a problem "all morning" for him (not sure if his own phone was AT&T but if you have anybody that you might need to interact with for work and their phone is AT&T you're boned too)
Feb 23 00:07:44 <Cowclops>	but he was talking past tense

Feb 23 04:05:20 <RoyalYork__>	A bit off topic, but has anyone built a DIY server rack with wood?
Feb 23 04:06:56 <Blondie101010>	many, but it's generally not a great idea
Feb 23 04:07:44 <Blondie101010>	not as resistant, not as simple to attach railings to, and not grounded
Feb 23 04:08:12 <Blondie101010>	and it burns
Feb 23 04:08:21 <RoyalYork__>	Im trying to make one for my basement. I have a r630 that I need to rack
Feb 23 04:09:11 <Blondie101010>	you may ignore my points but you are considerably increasing your chances of burning your house
Feb 23 04:09:24 <RoyalYork__>	Im not worried about that. Insurance will cover it
Feb 23 04:09:55 <RoyalYork__>	*if* it even happens
Feb 23 04:09:56 <Blondie101010>	I'm not a lawyer or insurer, but I'd suggest you revise their fine points
Feb 23 04:10:08 <RoyalYork__>	Blondie101010, you'd be surprised what insurance covers.
Feb 23 04:11:08 <RoyalYork__>	Accidental fire is one of them
Feb 23 04:11:28 <RoyalYork__>	But again, your policy may differ from mine
Feb 23 04:11:31 <RoyalYork__>	anyways off topic
Feb 23 04:13:46 <RoyalYork__>	Speaking of fine points, r/selfhosted is obssessed with telling to people to never open their ports and always run their servers trhough tailscale to a vps through cloudflare...
Feb 23 04:14:24 <RoyalYork__>	Its becoming a self fulfilling prophecy. One says its. Another hears it. Another says it. Another repeats it. Then its gospel
Feb 23 04:14:40 <Blondie101010>	not interested in cults
Feb 23 04:14:48 <Blondie101010>	I choose logic
Feb 23 04:15:07 <RoyalYork__>	have you heard about that obsession though?
Feb 23 04:15:31 <Blondie101010>	boh, not sure
Feb 23 04:15:48 <Blondie101010>	I've seen may types of weirdos but no one specifically fitting that
Feb 23 04:16:24 <RoyalYork__>	I take it you don't use reddit? Probably a good thing
Feb 23 04:16:40 <Blondie101010>	indeed...  that's a huge junkyard
Feb 23 04:31:53 <minimal>	don't worry, Google's just signed a deal to train its AI stuff on Reddit content so AI's will go further downhill in the future lol
Feb 23 04:32:09 <RoyalYork__>	Well, google search is already down hill
Feb 23 04:32:26 <RoyalYork__>	every search result is the exact. fucking. same!

Feb 23 04:35:36 <Blondie101010>	the results quality did decrease
Feb 23 05:25:14 <nullvalue>	hi
Feb 23 05:25:30 <nullvalue>	is it true a solar flare knocked comm's??
Feb 23 05:25:42 <nullvalue>	am jus reading abt it
Feb 23 05:32:47 <superkuh>	No.
Feb 23 05:35:36 <Blondie101010>	https://www.theweathernetwork.com/en/news/science/explainers/solar-storms-can-shut-down-the-internet
Feb 23 05:36:25 <superkuh>	The couple x class flares today and their associated active region have not been significant in terms of radio emissions.
Feb 23 05:37:04 <superkuh>	The ionization of the upper atmosphere by the xray, euv, and uv light was significant but does not effect cell networks. More things like GPS which are sensitive to phase which free charge in the path shifts.
Feb 23 05:39:32 <superkuh>	The sun and solar physics are cool though. No need to justify interest with spurious correlations. https://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/latest_events/
Feb 23 05:40:33 <nshire>	I have checked my phone and car gps during these events and my signal never seems to get degraded
Feb 23 05:41:41 <superkuh>	The areas just north and south of the subsolar point get the most total electron content change.
Feb 23 05:41:50 <superkuh>	That's generally equatorwards.
Feb 23 05:41:59 <superkuh>	Except for exceptional events.
Feb 23 06:27:19 <nullvalue>	ok
Feb 23 06:27:41 <nullvalue>	thnx for the infor superkuh , Blondie101010 
Feb 23 07:03:24 <azonenberg>	https://www.antikernel.net/temp/kup-lulz-48.png ok i think i'm just about done with what is turning out to be my largest board ever (in terms of area, nowhere near max component count)
Feb 23 07:03:31 <azonenberg>	so much for being a minimalistic test design lol
Feb 23 07:03:51 <azonenberg>	turns out SFP28s and QSFP28s take up a lot of board area. as do the zillion power rails you need for an FPGA this big
Feb 23 07:05:02 <mlu>	hot hot hot
Feb 23 07:05:42 <azonenberg>	mlu: not sure if you followed when i was talking about the backstory of this board
Feb 23 07:05:51 <azonenberg>	but i'm trying to put a kintex ultrascale+ on a 4 layer oshpark pcb
Feb 23 07:06:00 <azonenberg>	(because i'm insane)
Feb 23 07:06:10 <mlu>	fun!
Feb 23 07:06:20 <mlu>	how's the routing? :D
Feb 23 07:06:22 <azonenberg>	i managed to fan out all of the transceivers which shocked me lol
Feb 23 07:06:47 <azonenberg>	i lost most of the other IOs in the process but part of that was just because i didnt want to make the board even larger since fanout needs lots of area on 2 signal layers that are also used for some power distribution
Feb 23 07:07:06 <mlu>	azonenberg: I wonder if it gets much easier with 6-layer
Feb 23 07:07:08 <azonenberg>	https://www.antikernel.net/temp/kup-lulz-49.png
Feb 23 07:07:15 <azonenberg>	oh when i do this chip for real it'll be ten
Feb 23 07:07:25 <azonenberg>	SGS GPPG SGS
Feb 23 07:07:34 <mlu>	yeee!
Feb 23 07:07:52 <mlu>	5will it be pink?
Feb 23 07:07:53 <azonenberg>	i have a smaller kintex7 board made on that stackup as a test that's half assembled now just waiting on one part arriving tomorrow before i can populate the front
Feb 23 07:07:59 <azonenberg>	No i usually do blue for my custom boards
Feb 23 07:08:05 <azonenberg>	or red if for work
Feb 23 07:08:42 <mlu>	what about green?
Feb 23 07:08:48 <azonenberg>	Too boring everyone does that :p
Feb 23 07:08:56 <azonenberg>	But yeah the serdes fanout was a nightmare because i had two signal layers to work with - already a challenge
Feb 23 07:09:08 <azonenberg>	AND i needed to have both internal layers be ground to have good return paths
Feb 23 07:09:14 <azonenberg>	Which left nowhere for power
Feb 23 07:09:39 <azonenberg>	so i had to route power either on one of the signal layers, or on an internal layer with carefully arranged layout so the power was never under any of the fast signals
Feb 23 07:10:24 <azonenberg>	https://www.antikernel.net/temp/kup-lulz-50.png
Feb 23 07:10:39 <azonenberg>	this is the transceiver fanout. this is also my first time working with 25G per lane (SFP28 / QSFP28) rather than 10G
Feb 23 07:10:55 <azonenberg>	the length matching is going to get tuned more
Feb 23 07:11:34 <azonenberg>	oh, the other thing that's a challenge on OSHPark is that the dielectric is so far from the signal layers that your impedance-matched traces have to be enormous. a 50 ohm trace is like 0.38mm wide
Feb 23 07:11:57 <azonenberg>	vs like 0.09 to 0.15 on one of my more typical density optimized custom stackups
Feb 23 07:13:31 <azonenberg>	so the bga fanout gets much more difficult
Feb 23 07:15:32 <nshire>	azonenberg, do you fab those yourself?
Feb 23 07:15:39 <nshire>	or do you  have reflow hardware
Feb 23 07:26:37 <azonenberg>	nshire: i have a farberware toaster oven
Feb 23 07:26:39 <azonenberg>	lol
Feb 23 07:26:54 <nshire>	well I hope you have more than one toaster oven
Feb 23 07:27:16 <nshire>	otherwise your english muffins might taste a little funny in the morning
Feb 23 07:34:08 <azonenberg>	lol
Feb 23 07:34:13 <azonenberg>	i dont want crumbs on my boards either
Feb 23 07:34:17 <azonenberg>	this is a dedicated one that lives in a fume hood
Feb 23 07:34:20 <azonenberg>	but it's cheap and gets the job done
Feb 23 07:55:57 <mlu>	mmm making bone marrow in my toaster oven
Feb 23 07:56:02 <mlu>	it's gonna be epic
Feb 23 07:56:10 *	mlu wonders if he should have put the salt on before he put it in the oven
Feb 23 07:57:00 <nshire>	oh boy a flight of 5 light helis is flying over again. I wonder who stole a truck this time.
Feb 23 07:57:17 <nshire>	wrong channel. saw mlu and thought I was somewhere else
Feb 23 07:58:15 <elektrinis>	hi
Feb 23 07:58:24 <elektrinis>	are there any RF/antenna channels?
Feb 23 07:58:51 <nullvalue>	hi mlu
Feb 23 08:03:41 <mlu>	ello
Feb 23 08:03:46 <mlu>	elektrinis: try #electronics
Feb 23 08:24:06 <azonenberg>	elektrinis: yeah this channel is mostly about pushing packets. Although you will sometimes see discussion from the crazy folks like me (I think just me?) who do fun hardware work specifically related to pushing packets
Feb 23 08:24:28 <azonenberg>	like writing oscilloscope protocol decodes for ethernet, or designing switch fabrics
Feb 23 08:24:45 <elektrinis>	found hamradio
Feb 23 08:25:04 <elektrinis>	anyway I want to build a 5G 4x4 mimo antenna
Feb 23 08:25:12 <elektrinis>	and was looking in to biquads
Feb 23 09:21:18 <Lope>	I need to decide how to architect my network/infrastructure, any opinions, relevant experiences, comments or suggestions will be appreciated.
Feb 23 09:21:39 <Lope>	The way I have it currently is I have an internet-router, that provides internet to all the other VM's
Feb 23 09:22:47 <Lope>	Then I've got what I call a service-router, it does SSL-termination, SSL passthrough, pihole and dnsmasq for my local network, it also hosts a VPN server so all my things can connect to my other things.
Feb 23 09:23:05 <Lope>	things being movable things like laptops etc.
Feb 23 09:23:31 <Lope>	Now I'm introducing LTE, so I'm not only reliant on fiber.
Feb 23 09:23:42 <Lope>	So naturally the internet-router should do that, obviously.
Feb 23 09:24:17 <Lope>	However that changes things a bit. Because normally incoming connections come to the internet-router and it DNAT's them to the service-router.
Feb 23 09:24:28 <Lope>	However when I'm on LTE, can't get incoming connections on the LTE
Feb 23 09:25:30 <Lope>	So what I've done as a temporary workaround is I manually establish a VPN connection from my service-router to a VPS somewhere. Then I manually run a script that updates the A records of all my hostnames to the VPS IP.
Feb 23 09:25:51 <Lope>	Then the incoming connections go to the VPS, through the VPN to my service-router directly.
Feb 23 09:26:06 <Lope>	So this is where my architecture has become messy.
Feb 23 09:26:24 <Lope>	Because my service-router now needs to KNOW when the internet-router is using LTE
Feb 23 09:26:47 <Lope>	Normally the internet-router was updating all the hostnames' A records to the dynamic internet IP.
Feb 23 09:27:11 <Lope>	I suppose the internet-router could also update the A records to the VPS's IP.
Feb 23 09:27:25 <Lope>	but since the internet-router isn't managing the VPN that seems bad.
Feb 23 09:28:40 <Lope>	So it seems obvious that my internet-router should be setting up the VPN connection, but the reason why I don't do it is that I don't need all outgoing traffic to go through the VPN.
Feb 23 09:29:41 <Lope>	The reason why the service-router's outgoing traffic needs to go through the VPN, is that the VPS does DNAT to the service-router. And the service-router's services can't reply if it's default route isn't the VPS, so the traffic can go back out the way it came in.
Feb 23 09:30:28 <Lope>	I'm not a NAT expert. I've seen some indication that potentially SNAT would solve that issue. But my networking skills are in dodgy territory at that point.
Feb 23 09:31:11 <Lope>	I'm a programmer so obviously I have no problem making my service-router monitor the connection status on my internet-router.
Feb 23 09:31:21 <Lope>	But it just SEEMS MESSY.
Feb 23 09:31:35 <Lope>	And mess now normally equals problems later.
Feb 23 10:52:39 <anddam>	howdy, I am using FortiClient VPN on Windows. Can I use a third party client to connect to same VPN, possibly openvpn?
Feb 23 10:53:18 <anddam>	i.e. is VPN "standard" or has each provider its own secret sauce?
Feb 23 11:01:07 <Daniel>	you should be able to use different clients depending on the type of VPN server
Feb 23 11:01:35 <Daniel>	client has to support adding that type of profile for example
Feb 23 11:31:14 <needle>	of course you can use alternative clients
Feb 23 11:31:24 <needle>	If they are availble and working to fortinet 
Feb 23 11:31:45 <needle>	VPN is NOT a standard anddam 
Feb 23 11:32:03 <needle>	but you can use alternative software anyway, does not matter.
Feb 23 11:32:36 <needle>	With OpenVPN i am not sure it will work at all.
Feb 23 11:33:00 <needle>	Probably if you use CA authentication then further reading might be nessarry anddam 
Feb 23 11:33:54 <needle>	anddam: There is no standard VPN each implementaiton is slightly different.
Feb 23 11:36:47 <anddam>	I just figured out I am using FortiClient VPN that uses "SSL VPN" and that is a secret sauce
Feb 23 11:38:32 <Affliction>	Well, there are standards like ipsec, and I believe wireguard has a few distinct implementations, but yeah, proprietary ones are proprietary.

Feb 23 15:01:52 <cousin_luigi>	Any kamailio pro here? I'm trying to set up a SIP relay and the included example is lacking in fundamental details.
Feb 23 15:08:05 <Thedarkb>	Nevermind, found it.
Feb 23 15:43:32 <sinhue>	Hello. I'm trying to understand why one of our employees keeps getting disconnected from database. I started "ping dbserver -t" on her machine and waited for disconnect - which occured about 10 minutes in and didn't show any increase in latency or dropped packets in ping
Feb 23 15:44:16 <sinhue>	The client is Microsoft SQL management studio
Feb 23 16:26:50 <Blondie101010>	sinhue:  that sounds like something to check in your DB client and server and any involved conntracking rule it depends on...  look for timeouts and keepalives
Feb 23 16:34:58 <sinjini_>	hello, can you recommend a better way to learn networking doing practicals, I am a student
Feb 23 16:44:49 <djph>	sinjini_: read your class text?
Feb 23 16:46:38 <another|>	better compared to what?
Feb 23 17:26:18 <Blondie101010>	"practicals" implies experimenting and having real use cases, so go loose on the experimentation but finding reasonable test cases depends a lot on what you work with and know
Feb 23 17:27:11 <needle>	sinhue: search a job at ISP or IX near you. There you will get practical experience.
Feb 23 17:28:34 <Blondie101010>	mmm that would imply they get the job
Feb 23 17:32:00 <needle>	well, if you do not search for it, then you do not get it. 
Feb 23 17:32:27 <needle>	but considering the market now, you get everywhere a job as student in telco or IT.
Feb 23 17:35:21 <Leoneof>	Hello, if I perform a reset or hard reset on the ONU device, the settings will revert to their default state. However, is it true that after a short period, all settings will be automatically restored from the ISP?
Feb 23 17:37:19 <Thuryn>	Leoneof, depends on the isp
Feb 23 17:40:43 <Blondie101010>	most do keep a back door allowing that
Feb 23 17:41:34 <mlu>	it's to be expected of any device that functions on a shared network
Feb 23 17:41:50 <mlu>	either that, or else the malfunctioning device gets disabled
Feb 23 17:44:42 <ibs>	
Feb 23 18:03:11 <Leoneof>	i see, it's acs server and tr-069
Feb 23 18:42:57 <_steps>	Hey everyone, I'm in the process of configuring two servers, one of which will serve as an NFS server, and they will be connected directly to each other. I'm considering assigning static IP addresses within the APIPA range to avoid conflicts with other ranges.
Feb 23 18:43:03 <_steps>	Is this is a good practice for a direct server-to-server connection, or would you recommend using a dedicated private IP range instead? I want to avoid any potential issues.
Feb 23 18:44:12 <_steps>	I did a quick search online, but havent found anything about 
Feb 23 18:48:15 <needle>	direct connection where only 2 nodes are connected best /30
Feb 23 18:48:37 <needle>	short prefix like 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252 and vice versa.
Feb 23 18:48:49 <needle>	You can use apipa as well, but why?
Feb 23 18:49:08 <needle>	you might take TEST-NET1 instead like f.e. 192.0.2.0/30 for that case
Feb 23 18:49:17 <needle>	is a documentation prefix, not internet routed
Feb 23 18:49:45 <needle>	APIPA _could_ make strange problems for some applications if they hardcode things.
Feb 23 18:50:18 <needle>	but you may try it out, it might actually work. from the point of IP it should work _steps 
Feb 23 18:50:27 <needle>	APIPA is just another addressing.
Feb 23 18:51:24 <_steps>	"You can use apipa as well, but why?" because maybe, just maybe, 10.0.0.1 is already used by another server and I endup calsing internal routing issues 
Feb 23 18:51:55 <_steps>	"APIPA _could_ make strange problems for some applications if they hardcode things" true, havent thought of that 
Feb 23 18:52:57 <_steps>	ok, I think I will use a "random" /30 inside the 10.0.0.0/8 range 
Feb 23 18:53:11 <needle>	that will do. good decission.
Feb 23 18:53:21 <_steps>	I was just woried with best practices 
Feb 23 18:53:27 <_steps>	thank you 
Feb 23 19:26:02 <needle>	Using IPv6 LL addressing fe80::/10 will do that on point to point links as well.
Feb 23 19:27:13 <needle>	like fe80::a/127 fe80::b/127 as p2p example
Feb 23 19:52:55 <nullvalue>	evening

Feb 23 21:47:01 <ishan>	Hi, I am trying to setup snmp monitoring for my rb5009. I have added a snmp exporter on mikrotik(config: https://paste.debian.net/plainh/703c7fba) and I am using a telegraf for the snmp trap server. 
Feb 23 21:47:17 <ishan>	I get some data when I change state of an interface but it's not sending any thing else 
Feb 23 21:50:07 <ishan>	I checked with snmpwalk and it can see all the fields just fine 
Feb 23 21:51:37 <Blondie101010>	ishan:  what you just described is exactly what a trap is
Feb 23 21:52:04 <Blondie101010>	if you want to monitor counters, run snmp queries at interval
Feb 23 21:52:15 <ishan>	Ooh okay
Feb 23 21:52:29 <ishan>	Thank you! I'll set it up now 
Feb 23 21:52:52 <Blondie101010>	np
Feb 23 21:53:21 <catphish>	ishan: snmp traps only send events, as Blondie101010 says, if you want continuous monitoring, like traffic, you have to poll for it
Feb 23 21:53:45 <ishan>	noted, i am now configuring snmp input in telegraf
Feb 23 22:00:05 <jacekowski>	ishan: also, a lot of examples use old 32 bit interface counters
Feb 23 22:00:14 <jacekowski>	ishan: you want to use X tables with 64 bit counters
Feb 23 22:01:12 <jacekowski>	IF-MIB::ifXTable
Feb 23 22:01:14 <ishan>	got it, I did see some threads about this particular problem when I was searching for my query and I'll look into this 
Feb 23 23:06:24 <alwyn>	I'm trying to configure a vlan interface with dhcp on top of a bond interface but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right
Feb 23 23:06:50 <alwyn>	I'm looking at this example using nmstate, but it enables ipv4 on both the bond and the vlan interface, is that the correct way to go about it?
Feb 23 23:06:53 <alwyn>	https://nmstate.io/kubernetes-nmstate/examples.html#linux-bonding-with-vlan
Feb 23 23:13:54 <Blondie101010>	why would it matter if it's a bond or not
Feb 23 23:14:09 <Blondie101010>	it doesn't
Feb 23 23:14:28 <Blondie101010>	all sides of a bond should give comparable connectivity to the DHCP service
Feb 23 23:16:11 <tomman>	https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disabling-RNDIS-Attempt doesn't every Android cellphone ever uses RNDIS for tethering to PCs?
Feb 23 23:16:16 <tomman>	who even asked for such a flag?!
Feb 23 23:16:25 <tomman>	(also thaaaanks Moronix for the highly flammable headline)
Feb 23 23:17:21 <tomman>	>  RNDIS linux module is being deprecated and will be removed from the Linux Kernel in favor Network Control Model (NCM), but it is used by majority of devices nowadays (2023) and up to now the only way to configure working USB tethering for old Android devices.[1] For more recent devices (Android 14 era) try to use "Network Control Model (NCM) support" module first. 
Feb 23 23:17:22 <alwyn>	Blondie101010: it's just that I only need an address on the vlan, not the bond?
Feb 23 23:17:41 <tomman>	cool, that means I won't be able to tether with ANY of my Android cellphones, including my 2022 Redmi Note 11!
Feb 23 23:17:50 <Blondie101010>	alwyn:  that doesn't make more sense
Feb 23 23:17:52 <tomman>	(which speaks RNDIS, not NCM)
Feb 23 23:18:10 <Blondie101010>	if you have VLAN interfaces on that bond, the same rule applies
Feb 23 23:18:26 <alwyn>	I think I get your point
Feb 23 23:18:48 <alwyn>	the interfaces in the bond, the bond, and the vlan should all have the same connectivity to the DHCP server
Feb 23 23:18:56 <Blondie101010>	yes
Feb 23 23:19:21 <ishan>	thank you for the help everyone! i made a dashboard for my sfp stats(https://dash.ishanjain.me/public-dashboards/a9e953e60060400d9492581b454df732?orgId=1) and I'll add the other data later 
Feb 23 23:19:54 <Blondie101010>	don't leave that there
Feb 23 23:20:00 <Blondie101010>	it could help hackers hurt you
Feb 23 23:20:30 <ishan>	i am only making the basic sfp stats public to share with my isp
Feb 23 23:20:34 <ishan>	rest of it will be private
Feb 23 23:20:58 <Blondie101010>	yeah not much to go with, besides the temp which would likely go up in case of attack
Feb 23 23:25:54 <Blondie101010>	even with the best software and passwords, I still wouldn't leave https://dash.ishanjain.me/login on the public network
Feb 23 23:27:14 <ishan>	Hah, I agree! i like the convenience(don't have to use vpns everytime) and I understand the risks
Feb 23 23:27:47 <ishan>	I have thought about putting another auth layer in front but it gets annoying
Feb 23 23:31:47 <Blondie101010>	another auth in front likely wouldn't make it a lot better
Feb 23 23:32:10 <Blondie101010>	management consoles should only be available on the LAN side
Feb 23 23:32:26 <Blondie101010>	so use VPN, ssh tunnels, or similar to get there
Feb 23 23:34:32 <Blondie101010>	most network device security issues are mitigated that way, so you would be preventing 50% of future risks
Feb 23 23:41:06 <Blondie101010>	hi karthy
Feb 23 23:41:32 <Blondie101010>	seeing your nick made me wonder about your progress

Feb 24 16:42:11 <Blondie101010>	what was the RX on each side before, and what is it now with attenuators? please think Mathematically/logically..  don't act as if you were using some voodoo gadget
Feb 24 16:45:09 <THE_GFR|WORK>	I am not
Feb 24 16:45:17 <THE_GFR|WORK>	not acting that way anyway
Feb 24 16:45:35 <THE_GFR|WORK>	I need to add the attenuators to the other end and then test to make sure 
Feb 24 16:45:48 <Blondie101010>	gosh...  the proof that you are is that you did not even answer me
Feb 24 16:45:53 <Blondie101010>	it was not an attack
Feb 24 16:45:57 <Blondie101010>	a suggestion!
Feb 24 16:46:03 <THE_GFR|WORK>	indeed I understood that
Feb 24 16:46:04 <Inline>	evening
Feb 24 16:46:29 <THE_GFR|WORK>	I am going to add the attenuators to the other end and then test and see and report back I just was initially saying that I wasn't getting close to 10Gb yet
Feb 24 16:46:47 <THE_GFR|WORK>	hmm that reminds me
Feb 24 16:48:41 <THE_GFR|WORK>	but since I can't have my system down offline right now I can't test until later
Feb 24 16:50:51 <Blondie101010>	I think you had checked the signal info with us last time, so find the baseline you did then and now recheck the same measures with the attenuators you now put in place
Feb 24 16:51:28 <THE_GFR|WORK>	I need the others in place first for what I am doing since I do not have a direct connection atm but yea
Feb 24 16:51:33 <Blondie101010>	if I remember correctly, your biggest indicator of problem was the temp
Feb 24 16:51:34 <THE_GFR|WORK>	I agree I will look and see
Feb 24 16:51:41 <THE_GFR|WORK>	the temps are not out of spec
Feb 24 16:51:44 <THE_GFR|WORK>	I checked
Feb 24 16:51:50 <THE_GFR|WORK>	they can go up to 70c 
Feb 24 16:51:54 <THE_GFR|WORK>	and are at 50 and 62c
Feb 24 16:52:01 <Blondie101010>	so lower than before?
Feb 24 16:52:06 <THE_GFR|WORK>	no
Feb 24 16:52:09 <THE_GFR|WORK>	~ the same
Feb 24 16:53:11 <THE_GFR|WORK>	end result is "I am still not getting anywhere close to 10Gb on my fiber" so I will continue bashing away at it until I discover something
Feb 24 16:53:53 <Blondie101010>	try to do concurrent speed tests and add them up to see if that matches
Feb 24 16:54:37 <Blondie101010>	that problem is frequently due to a linear limitation if nothing seems overloaded
Feb 24 16:55:16 <THE_GFR|WORK>	linear limitation?
Feb 24 16:55:35 <Blondie101010>	yes, a single stream limit
Feb 24 16:55:45 <THE_GFR|WORK>	oh I used iperf 
Feb 24 16:56:06 <THE_GFR|WORK>	but yea I understand what you are saying
Feb 24 16:56:07 <Blondie101010>	yeah I know, but that can not overcome the OS
Feb 24 16:56:15 <THE_GFR|WORK>	yea true
Feb 24 16:56:37 <THE_GFR|WORK>	unless I do direct memory transfers what is it called since I can't remember
Feb 24 16:56:48 <rustyaxe>	Migrating to netbox+kea+powerdns, this should be fun
Feb 24 16:56:59 <THE_GFR|WORK>	lol rustyaxe

Feb 24 16:57:38 <THE_GFR|WORK>	;
Feb 24 16:57:41 <THE_GFR|WORK>	;)
Feb 24 17:00:01 <rustyaxe>	so far its going pretty smooth really
Feb 24 17:01:22 <THE_GFR|WORK>	cool
Feb 24 17:06:50 <rustyaxe>	Not really sure how i wnt this to all work out.. I intended to put openwrt or pfsense in proxmox vm with srv-io passthru of my NICs but... i couldnt fight my way into a working system lol
Feb 24 17:08:16 <rustyaxe>	Installing proxmox onto a truly headless box isnt worth the strife it seems; so just threw devuan on it, setup stuff in docker and calling it good enough for now
Feb 24 17:10:22 <JakLareo>	rustyaxe: did you try using the Proxmox installer? I was able to get a headless proxmox server up and running pretty easily using that
Feb 24 17:15:48 <rustyaxe>	JakLareo: with serial console? Yea i had 0 luck there
Feb 24 17:20:07 <JakLareo>	Sorry to hear that. I know they are progressively improving the text-based installer, with the intent of allowing full installation over *just* a serial console, so perhaps future developments will make it easier for you
Feb 24 17:21:41 <rustyaxe>	JakLareo: Indeed. Normally i just use ilo/etc so no biggy
Feb 24 17:22:26 <rustyaxe>	Part of it comes from a few quirks of the platform that must be attended to during installation (like loading the watchdog modules before 5 minutes has elapsed since UEFI handoff)
Feb 24 17:22:48 <rustyaxe>	part comes from their grub (i think) loader forcing graphics mode :P
Feb 24 17:23:13 <rustyaxe>	I cant even get past that bit on the serial line. :o i see it reading the usb stick but i cant interact it. Next time :)

Feb 24 17:32:23 <Cowclops>	i see proxmox discussion
Feb 24 17:32:45 <Cowclops>	i went from "installing proxmox at tuesday at 4pm on a random dell t140" to "100% comfortable using proxmox and administrating it by like thursday at noon"
Feb 24 17:32:51 <Cowclops>	having never touched it before
Feb 24 17:33:18 <Cowclops>	The only gotchas were: every dell 14th gen server seems to have issues with a certain bios setting and the linux 6.5 kernel. had to turn off x2acpi in the bios settings to get it to not freeze on "loading ramdisk"
Feb 24 17:33:28 <Cowclops>	t140, t340, r640, all of 'em though i was using a t140
Feb 24 17:33:58 <Cowclops>	its funny because our friend-of-the-company MSP that we talk to about stuff like this was doing the same thing on a t340 and he's like "new version seems janky, just locked up on loading ram disk" and i told him how to fix it
Feb 24 17:34:08 <Cowclops>	we just happen to have coincidentally bought a bunch of dell hardware at the same time
Feb 24 17:35:44 <Cowclops>	The other thing i had to figure out is just the exact syntax/"how you're supposed to" configure the networking. like my first try to add a vlan interface led me to getting locked out of the box, not because i correctly applied an incorrect configuration, but because i was so far from right that it just glitched out the whole network stat. Was not familiar with the interface.number syntax 
Feb 24 17:35:44 <Cowclops>	for vlans. The answer is if you want the host to listen on a different vlan than anything else in it, you create a vlan interface and call it, for example, vmbr0.100 to put bridge0 on vlan 100
Feb 24 17:36:56 <rustyaxe>	Cowclops: ive got proxmox running on several machines just fine
Feb 24 17:37:17 <rustyaxe>	Getting it into this little cloud router.. not so pleasant (no display besides serial 80x25 consol ;)
Feb 24 17:38:15 <rustyaxe>	Cowclops: thats a linuxism the interface.vlan thing
Feb 24 17:38:29 <rustyaxe>	but ya its nice when its working
Feb 24 17:45:42 <Cowclops>	Yep. While not generally clueless about linux system administration, i hadn't configured any linux box for a "multiple nics, multiple networks, multiple bridges" kinda scenario
Feb 24 17:45:49 <Cowclops>	So I watched a video on it and had it figured out in like 15 minutes
Feb 24 17:45:59 <Cowclops>	Easy-when-known but not self explanatory
Feb 24 17:46:20 <Cowclops>	I think my mistake was that i created a vlan interface and called it like, vlan100 and tried to tell proxmox that its underlying interface was vmbr0
Feb 24 17:46:24 <Cowclops>	it didn't like that.
Feb 24 17:46:33 <Cowclops>	the interface needed to be called vmbr0.100
Feb 24 17:46:42 <Cowclops>	And in fact when you do so, it auto-fills-in the underlying interface
Feb 24 17:47:43 <Cowclops>	The other thing i like that proxmox does is show you what its going to change to the interfaces file
Feb 24 17:47:48 <Cowclops>	so you hit apply then it does it
Feb 24 17:48:12 <Cowclops>	That and, you can make "a bunch of changes" then hit apply. You don't need to paly the slide puzzle game of disabling and re-enabling things in a way that forces it to go down while you're working on it
Feb 24 17:48:42 <Cowclops>	"You can't assign en0 to vmbr0 because its assigned to vmbr1" no, you don't see that message because you can do all your configuration then full send. ASSUMING you did it right, itj ust goes down for a second and comes back. doing it wrong is obviously your funeral
Feb 24 17:49:09 <Cowclops>	But you don't have to temporarily have en0 assigned to nothing
Feb 24 17:50:03 <Cowclops>	that said, on a production system its gonna be like, dedicated management interface port with no complex networking so you can never lock yourself out, then the VMs communicate with the network through another aggregated pair of faster links for performance.
Feb 24 17:50:13 <Cowclops>	and maybe another pair of links for networked storage if you have a san
Feb 24 17:51:53 <Blondie101010>	SAN networks can contain multiple paths
Feb 24 17:53:19 <Cowclops>	Yep. For actual iscsi i say a pair of networks, but i would not do a bridge, i'd do two dedicated interfaces 
Feb 24 17:53:35 <Cowclops>	i should say i wouldn't do link aggregation. 
Feb 24 17:53:40 <Cowclops>	but also not a bridge
Feb 24 17:54:42 <Cowclops>	for my particular use case the most useful thingi s going to be having my hypervisor's underlying storage be whatever zfs pool i want it to be
Feb 24 17:57:04 <Blondie101010>	yeah it's sane to balance storage and network speed for those
Feb 24 17:57:08 <hjf>	i configured ospf and ospfv3 for my network
Feb 24 17:57:13 <hjf>	man that was a lot of pain
Feb 24 17:57:23 <hjf>	mikrotik's ui for this is just terrible
Feb 24 18:21:36 <catphish>	hjf: ospf is usually totally trivial
Feb 24 18:22:09 <catphish>	just turn it on on the appropriate interfaces and it works!
Feb 24 18:29:55 <hjf>	catphish: there were some filter shenanigans
Feb 24 18:30:13 <catphish>	in what way? i've never known ospf to be filtered
Feb 24 18:30:16 <hjf>	one of the filters was check gateway: ping, and it failed
Feb 24 18:30:37 <hjf>	apparently mt calls "filters" certain rules you apply to OSPF routes
Feb 24 18:31:04 <catphish>	ah, i'm not that familiar with mt, i would never normally have any filters on ospf
Feb 24 18:31:26 <hjf>	yes once i removed said filters it started working
Feb 24 18:31:37 <hjf>	i couldn't make it summarize routes though
Feb 24 18:31:58 <hjf>	i have a /16 for each site but it's publishing individual /24s for some reason
Feb 24 19:03:44 <Cowclops>	<hjf> mikrotik's ui ~~for this~~ is just terrible
Feb 24 19:04:15 <Cowclops>	as an owner of a mikrotik product and somebody cheering from the sidelines because they have ridiculously high speed switches that don't cost all that much money brand new and i want the company to do well
Feb 24 19:04:30 <Cowclops>	they put all their points into making 25gbps+ devices that are inexpensive and too little money into developing the management interface
Feb 24 19:04:49 <Cowclops>	This would not even stop me from recommending them
Feb 24 19:04:53 <Cowclops>	Its just not their forte

Feb 25 03:16:40 <Disconsented>	Im not sure what I did but I now have IPv6 actually working :D
Feb 25 03:17:24 <Disconsented>	Well, I know some of what I did, a lot of the features I had were DHCP-v6 specific which didnt exactly help with SLAAC
Feb 25 03:25:17 <Disconsented>	https://paste.disconsented.com/p/egpXZa
Feb 25 05:17:37 <sphertext_>	can someone pls help me understand what the bind= option does here? `socat \ EXEC:"mail.sh target@domain.com",fdin=3,fdout=4 \TCP4:mail.relay.org:25,crnl,bind=alias1.server.org,mss=512`
Feb 25 05:18:03 <sphertext_>	like i thought bind was to specify the network interface to use 
Feb 25 05:18:18 <sphertext_>	by indicating an ip rnage associated with that interface 
Feb 25 05:18:30 <sphertext_>	but this example uses a hostname instead
Feb 25 05:19:54 <sphertext_>	the example is from the socat manual btw http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html#EXAMPLES
Feb 25 05:30:09 <rustyaxe>	i'd say probably uses the first IP for the hostname
Feb 25 05:30:20 <rustyaxe>	could use a random one tho which would be odd
Feb 25 05:30:44 <rustyaxe>	Depends how it handles resolving i'd suppose as libc can/will reorder replies
Feb 25 05:31:08 <sphertext_>	so my assumption about what bind= does in general was correct?
Feb 25 06:46:41 <kurahaupo>	sphertext: with TCP you never get to specify an interface, you can however specify a source address, and hope that your routing rules will use the relevant interface
Feb 25 06:48:24 <kurahaupo>	(if you have more then one upstream interface, you should have source-routing rules, to ensure you send packets out the correct interface for the chosen source address)
Feb 25 06:49:58 <kurahaupo>	(The old SysV networking model is terrible at this.)
Feb 25 07:11:05 <sphertext_>	kurahaupo and the source address can be anything, even a hostname you don't control?
Feb 25 07:19:32 <Blondie101010>	obviously not
Feb 25 07:21:01 <Blondie101010>	source IP spoofing would involve a client hack, and can not do anything useful on TCP
Feb 25 07:35:50 <sphertext_>	so annoying to answer a genuine question with "obviously wrong" 
Feb 25 07:36:09 <Ximo>	true
Feb 25 07:59:44 <Blondie101010>	sphertext:  it's just as if you did a SNAT with an IP you don't control.... that's what I described...  TCP requires a handshake, so return packets reaching the source

Feb 27 23:50:00 <marcopolo1_>	How does rdp also uses tcp
Feb 27 23:50:26 <pulsar12>	rdp is always tcp far as i know
Feb 27 23:50:43 <rustyaxe>	ja rdp is tcp
Feb 27 23:50:52 <marcopolo1_>	I didnt know you could use two protocols at the same time
Feb 27 23:51:13 <rustyaxe>	?
Feb 27 23:51:39 <pulsar12>	tcp is just the transport.
Feb 27 23:51:50 <pulsar12>	rdp is application level protocol
Feb 27 23:52:05 <marcopolo1_>	Do all protocols need tcp/udp
Feb 27 23:52:18 <pulsar12>	99%
Feb 27 23:54:32 <marcopolo1_>	You dont need rdp to connect to a computer you could just register your router on the internet and have your drive accesible via http
Feb 27 23:55:07 <pulsar12>	true, you can access files or http pages without rdp
Feb 28 00:02:21 <catphish>	all protocols are built on top of other protocols
Feb 28 00:06:29 <Thuryn>	rdp uses lots of ports.  tcp/3389 is just the most basic.
Feb 28 00:46:47 <marcopolo1_>	What o you mean by basic
Feb 28 00:47:49 <mdogg>	Install a fireman pole instead.

Feb 29 01:03:26 <Harm133>	I can also set the size in my in house tool
Feb 29 01:03:47 <Harm133>	the perfomance tanked in 10kb

Feb 29 01:04:00 <Harm133>	HMmm
Feb 29 01:04:42 <jacekowski>	don't go above 1460
Feb 29 01:04:58 <jacekowski>	unless you have jumbo frames
Feb 29 01:05:41 <Harm133>	I'll have to tinker with those settings to see what its using
Feb 29 01:06:10 <Harm133>	but it should split on MTU right
Feb 29 01:06:34 <Harm133>	Hmm I don't have enough knowledge about the inner workings of the generation of the traffic for this
Feb 29 01:07:04 <Harm133>	but, the link is working as expected, iperf wise then?
Feb 29 01:07:21 <jacekowski>	seems like it
Feb 29 01:07:29 <jacekowski>	so it is your software that migth be the problem
Feb 29 01:07:34 <jacekowski>	how are you generating the packets
Feb 29 01:07:51 <Harm133>	its some C code, very specific
Feb 29 01:07:57 <Harm133>	can't share unforunately
Feb 29 01:08:59 <Harm133>	but this helps
Feb 29 01:09:18 <Harm133>	I'll go check with the devs to see if they can shed some light on how they generate and determine size
Feb 29 01:10:24 <jacekowski>	you want to let OS handle as much as possible
Feb 29 01:10:46 <Harm133>	I think we just send packets of 1 MB to the kernel, which should split them right
Feb 29 01:10:56 <Harm133>	segmant I guess
Feb 29 01:11:05 <jacekowski>	if you are doing kernel transition for each 200 byte packet, your performance is going to suck
Feb 29 01:11:16 <Harm133>	segment*
Feb 29 01:11:44 <Blondie101010>	well however it has to be split, it's implying another layer of overhead

Feb 29 03:15:51 <chives>	Anyone know of a lightweight program that simulates a router on windows?
Feb 29 03:19:27 <chives>	well hmm i guess i could use a socks5 proxy on there...
Feb 29 03:35:07 <Blondie101010>	not clear what your goal is, and even less if a proxy can solve it
Feb 29 03:47:22 <chives>	I've gave up on the complicated stuff I'm just looking for a lightweight proxy server that supports tcp and udp for windows sadly that uses the standard default gateway on the windows box for a linux client machine
Feb 29 03:54:59 <Whiskey`>	chives: as Blondie101010 said, true requirements unclear. why not just route or put the linux box on the same lan as the windows
Feb 29 03:58:42 <chives>	Whiskey`: its too confusing to explain really.  I've got a windows box that uses a virtual adapter for internet that works ok but since its in software it starts to get flaky when you try and make a router with the software interface (it works but over complicates and is almost a mystery to get it working) so im hoping to simplify the issue by using a simple lightweight proxy service on the
Feb 29 03:58:44 <chives>	windows box
Feb 29 03:59:29 <chives>	to "route" the linux box that is using tun2proxy
Feb 29 04:01:08 <Whiskey`>	sounds like it needs to be designed better then. ive never had a issue making windows route, other than its just slow and meh in general.
Feb 29 04:02:32 <chives>	like i said it works, but the programs arent really designed with the software in mind if it was a hardware nic it would probably be ok but the ones ive tried are complicated and dialog boxes dont really work right but somehow if you do it just right it works but if you close the dialog or reboot the machine or the service terminates you got to do it all over again so like i said...
Feb 29 04:03:24 <chives>	all that complexity for just getting some tcp/udp on the linux box so id think a lightweight proxy would probably work better
Feb 29 04:03:25 <Blondie101010>	you excel at providing no useful information
Feb 29 04:03:52 <Blondie101010>	so my guess is that you simply patch things until something works
Feb 29 04:04:33 <chives>	My info is only as good as my search results sadly, i had used nat32 successfully but its a manual setup to get working because it wants to do all these extra things that arent supported in my setup and another one i cant remember off the top of my head
Feb 29 04:04:38 <Whiskey`>	then get dante or some such. i dont think the issue is because its a software interface.
Feb 29 04:05:38 <chives>	Whiskey`: its because it cant be customized or reconfigured in my setup so i just want a simple nat router but they want to do everything
Feb 29 04:06:06 <chives>	but like i said im trying to avoid that maybe with a simple proxy server on the windows box
Feb 29 04:06:36 <Thuryn>	"i just want a simple nat router but they want to do everything"  <-- I don't know what this means
Feb 29 04:06:46 <Whiskey`>	no one does
Feb 29 04:07:31 <chives>	Well you are pointing in the direction away from my intent and trying not to complicate the explanations where there isnt really much good to come from it i dont think
Feb 29 04:07:32 <Blondie101010>	and he asked for a router simulator :/
Feb 29 04:07:38 <Whiskey`>	and there is no rhyme to why you would be routing a linux box via this windows box. its meh. so just go get a socks proxy, there are 100's of them.
Feb 29 04:08:06 <Thuryn>	" Well you are pointing in the direction away from my intent"  <--  wrong
Feb 29 04:08:20 <chives>	but to answer your question just look up nat32 and you will see its the most complicated windows router program ive seen
Feb 29 04:08:30 <chives>	but it DID work (as long as you didnt close the dialog)
Feb 29 04:08:42 <Whiskey`>	thats not how you route on windows bleh
Feb 29 04:09:06 <Thuryn>	Internet Connection Sharing doesn't work?
Feb 29 04:09:27 <chives>	nope it reconfigures the adapter, and in my setup it has to be exactly configured as it is
Feb 29 04:09:55 <Thuryn>	what do you mean it "reconfigures the adapter?"  what does it change?
Feb 29 04:09:59 <Blondie101010>	handling networking on Windows is a bad idea...  use the Linux box for that
Feb 29 04:10:01 <chives>	so im thinking just avoid all the adapter stuff and have a simple proxy for the linux box
Feb 29 04:10:37 <Blondie101010>	but if you must use Windows, learn to do it properly, and that may involve learning powershell
Feb 29 04:12:18 <chives>	If you remember... in my setup i guess it overcomplicated it.  It worked kind of but wasnt super reliable, and from what it looks like now the upstream proxy may not support udp other than dns
Feb 29 04:12:48 <Blondie101010>	that depends on what you proxy with
Feb 29 04:12:59 <chives>	so there may be some "secret sauce" to their virtual adapter that works for udp
Feb 29 04:13:13 <Blondie101010>	what is that proxy?
Feb 29 04:13:15 <Blondie101010>	be specific
Feb 29 04:13:24 <chives>	why?
Feb 29 04:13:31 <Blondie101010>	to help you but forget it
Feb 29 04:13:39 <Blondie101010>	sounds like a socks4
Feb 29 04:14:00 <chives>	its an isp provided proxy that cant be reconfigured that uses proprietary software that "just works" but only on windows
Feb 29 04:14:16 <Thuryn>	chives, no one can help you if you don't answer questions.  the details matter.
Feb 29 04:14:25 <Blondie101010>	if you don't provide anyone that software's details, you're automatically trolling
Feb 29 04:14:33 <chives>	i dont like to reveal personal details and in my situation that would be personal details
Feb 29 04:14:44 <Blondie101010>	you refuse to give the protocol they use and the name
Feb 29 04:14:49 <Blondie101010>	too bad, no help 
Feb 29 04:15:12 <chives>	but why all of this communication exactly opposite of what my intent is?
Feb 29 04:15:22 <chives>	which i guess might be trolling?
Feb 29 04:15:44 <Blondie101010>	that would be you, by voluntarily omitting any detail
Feb 29 04:15:45 <Thuryn>	<chives> but why all of this communication exactly opposite of what my intent is? 
Feb 29 04:15:46 <chives>	i mean im ok in explaining my reasons for trying it this way but
Feb 29 04:15:49 <Thuryn>	because we are not chatbots
Feb 29 04:16:07 <Blondie101010>	chives:  don't need reasons
Feb 29 04:16:11 <chives>	at some point if you ask for my private ssh key i might start asking questions
Feb 29 04:16:13 <Thuryn>	we're not required to agree that your intent is the right one
Feb 29 04:16:14 <Blondie101010>	what is the program name or protocol used?
Feb 29 04:16:39 <Blondie101010>	like I said, it sounds like socks4
Feb 29 04:16:56 <chives>	its just a proprietary program that would be a "personal leak" for me to reveal but other than that it doesnt change the problem
Feb 29 04:17:12 <Blondie101010>	so your ISP has special programs for you?
Feb 29 04:17:30 <Blondie101010>	that is senseless
Feb 29 04:17:37 <chives>	well apparently it is, it works for dns udp but... the interesting thing though is somehow its transporting udp over tcp
Feb 29 04:17:50 <chives>	for the windows box
Feb 29 04:18:01 <Thuryn>	dns can run over TCP
Feb 29 04:18:11 <Thuryn>	is it possible it's not using UDP at all?
Feb 29 04:18:30 <Blondie101010>	chives:  why all the mystery?  it's clear that 99% of the little information you give is BS
Feb 29 04:18:36 <chives>	no that is what confused me about it being socks5 i think... since it is a special case that is transparently supports it i think anyway
Feb 29 04:18:45 <Blondie101010>	no ISP provides secret proxy software
Feb 29 04:19:14 <chives>	i just dont really know just my own tests for what works and not trying to "reverse engineer" i suppose not deep level anything but just basics
Feb 29 04:19:42 <Blondie101010>	are you trying to bypass the ISP device?
Feb 29 04:20:33 <Thuryn>	whether DNS uses TCP or UDP is not deep level anything.  you can just select it from the command line (if you have dig or delv installed)
Feb 29 04:21:01 <Blondie101010>	I love to tcpdump DNS
Feb 29 04:21:14 <Blondie101010>	which HTTP was so simple
Feb 29 04:21:18 <Blondie101010>	*wish
Feb 29 04:21:32 <chives>	well not really i dont think anymore i spent a lot of time trying to make it simple i was thinking maybe they box could work the same with an open solution but.... at this point was just going to try and simplify it based off my experiences ofof what hasnt worked
Feb 29 04:21:48 <chives>	both not box*
Feb 29 04:21:56 <Blondie101010>	chives:  why does your ISP provide you with secret software?
Feb 29 04:22:13 <Blondie101010>	start to make sense and then we can discuss!
Feb 29 04:22:22 <chives>	its not secret its just an isp for three people
Feb 29 04:22:40 <OurRoyalGabe>	It's a secret isp
Feb 29 04:22:48 <Blondie101010>	:|
Feb 29 04:22:49 <chives>	and no its just a tiny isp in the country
Feb 29 04:23:02 <Blondie101010>	that doesn't explain anything
Feb 29 04:23:38 <chives>	what do you want to know other than specific details like name and address...
Feb 29 04:23:41 <Blondie101010>	but it does look like the worst possible ISP based on that
Feb 29 04:23:51 <Blondie101010>	bah don't care
Feb 29 04:23:56 <Blondie101010>	you clearly chose them
Feb 29 04:24:05 <OurRoyalGabe>	I guess there's scalability issues if it's tiny 
Feb 29 04:24:08 <OurRoyalGabe>	Makes sense 
Feb 29 04:24:22 <another|>	So this tiny ISP requires some kind of proprietary software to ... get internet?
Feb 29 04:24:36 <Blondie101010>	I have no idea why any size ISP would need a proxy
Feb 29 04:24:48 <OurRoyalGabe>	A bastion host?
Feb 29 04:25:02 <chives>	my google searches are so bad now i cant even find a simple proxy it pulled up "3proxy" but it wants me to accept a "license agreement" and as usual there's missing documentation and in this case even translation issues apparently
Feb 29 04:25:02 <Blondie101010>	I didn't mean for their own use
Feb 29 04:25:24 <Blondie101010>	chives:  get a real ISP
Feb 29 04:25:37 <another|>	If you can't answer questions I'm out
Feb 29 04:25:46 <chives>	Blondie101010: well i guess its just meant for windows since who really uses linux in the country
Feb 29 04:26:00 <Blondie101010>	you haven't given any details yet
Feb 29 04:26:04 <Blondie101010>	what is the program?
Feb 29 04:26:21 <Blondie101010>	what ports does it use?
Feb 29 04:26:24 <chives>	its just a proprietary program they have you install what do you want to know about it other than name?
Feb 29 04:26:35 <chives>	it creates a virtual adapter...
Feb 29 04:26:42 <chives>	it requires a specific ip...
Feb 29 04:26:55 <another|>	and you need that to go online?
Feb 29 04:27:11 <Blondie101010>	somehow reminds me of dialup packages for win3.1
Feb 29 04:28:14 <chives>	yep kinda reminds me of those old satellite providers where you had a usb virtual adapter for the wan side
Feb 29 04:28:20 <chives>	its just as reliable when you try and share it
Feb 29 04:28:30 <chives>	but works fine otherwise
Feb 29 04:28:38 <Blondie101010>	that is simply because you refuse to know what it is
Feb 29 04:28:47 <Blondie101010>	you refuse to help yourself!
Feb 29 04:29:45 <chives>	i really want to know... because i was thinking it was using the same proxy that is open for the proprietary software program but idk anymore... because udp works in windows and if i use the proxy with tun2proxy i cant get udp working so im not sure maybe its a different thing
Feb 29 04:30:17 <Blondie101010>	what is the program name?:
Feb 29 04:30:24 <Blondie101010>	if you want to know, you need to give details
Feb 29 04:30:56 <Blondie101010>	"proprietary software program" means nothing and almost certainly is FALSE
Feb 29 04:31:18 <Blondie101010>	probably a simple packaged solution at best
Feb 29 04:32:40 <chives>	nope i promise its just a program they have you download and install for internet i might as well tell you the name its... internet.exe
Feb 29 04:32:48 <chives>	*/sigh
Feb 29 04:33:26 <chives>	but not sure what it matters
Feb 29 04:33:28 <chives>	why*
Feb 29 04:33:46 <Blondie101010>	how do you download it before you have internet access?
Feb 29 04:34:09 <Blondie101010>	gosh you're a bad troll
Feb 29 04:34:35 <chives>	im not im really trying to find a proxy server
Feb 29 04:35:01 <chives>	thatll probably work and then itll be solved
Feb 29 04:35:15 <another|>	alrighty. good luck then
Feb 29 04:35:31 <chives>	you know at some point where youve spent a lot of time trying one way
Feb 29 04:35:42 <Thuryn>	what version of Windows?
Feb 29 04:35:48 <chives>	windows 11 sadly
Feb 29 04:35:51 <lockywolf>	I remember such a technology back in the days.
Feb 29 04:36:00 <lockywolf>	We had to install a thing called "firewall client"
Feb 29 04:36:15 <lockywolf>	I was a lamer that time, so I don't know what it did.
Feb 29 04:37:05 <lockywolf>	But presumably had some way to authorize a user.
Feb 29 04:37:32 <chives>	Blondie101010: i fear you are just trying to get the answer :) does it matter if it was usb or cd?
Feb 29 04:37:40 <lockywolf>	btw Hacker News has repaired their ipv6 setup after me nagging at them for about a month
Feb 29 04:38:11 <Blondie101010>	chives:  time for you to get back in 24
Feb 29 04:38:29 <Thuryn>	https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/v7s6i4/using_a_windows_box_as_a_proxy_server_corporate/
Feb 29 04:38:33 <Thuryn>	chives,  --^
Feb 29 04:38:49 <chives>	its really that sadly simple and there no source i might check the directory and see if there is anything interesting there to hint about it, but if i open wireshark its just a whole bunch of tls and tcp protocols on the lan side where it has to traverse for both getting to and leaving the wan
Feb 29 04:39:22 <azonenberg>	Blondie101010: re "tiny ISP with proprietary software" reminds me of using juno dialup back in the day
Feb 29 04:39:36 <azonenberg>	with an adware bar on the top of your screen and ten hours a month of free connectivity
Feb 29 04:39:50 <uwu>	netzero
Feb 29 04:40:04 <lockywolf>	hehe
Feb 29 04:40:09 <Thuryn>	chives, Apache runs on Windows and can be configured as a forward proxy
Feb 29 04:40:09 <azonenberg>	yeah juno and netzero were either arms of the same parent company or one bought the other or something like that
Feb 29 04:40:22 <Blondie101010>	back then I had my own static IP on dialup
Feb 29 04:40:40 <lockywolf>	I remember a BBS with "free" porn back in early 2000s, which would dial up on some shady server in Lichtenstein
Feb 29 04:40:44 <chives>	ha see its not THAT bad
Feb 29 04:41:06 <Blondie101010>	lockywolf:  sounds like most dialers
Feb 29 04:41:13 <lockywolf>	Blondie101010: "most"?
Feb 29 04:41:18 <chives>	reminds me of wolfenstein when i had to play it on a 286
Feb 29 04:41:19 <lockywolf>	I have only ever seen a single one.
Feb 29 04:41:20 <Thuryn>	lockywolf, Offworld?
Feb 29 04:41:47 <Blondie101010>	lockywolf:  porn dialers that got installed maliciously or stupidly were common
Feb 29 04:42:13 <Blondie101010>	ads for free porn that ended up costing 500$
Feb 29 04:42:18 <lockywolf>	Thuryn: never heard of them
Feb 29 04:42:29 <lockywolf>	well, not in our realm, I guess
Feb 29 04:42:32 <Blondie101010>	an old friend did that once :S
Feb 29 04:42:53 <Blondie101010>	the phone provider was used to this type of problem
Feb 29 04:44:26 <Blondie101010>	the call was to sao tome
Feb 29 04:44:30 <lockywolf>	Thuryn: what is "offworld"?
Feb 29 04:44:33 <Blondie101010>	ridiculously priced
Feb 29 04:44:41 <Blondie101010>	clearly a scam
Feb 29 04:44:57 <lockywolf>	Blondie101010: ow, so there was actually no porn?
Feb 29 04:45:05 <Blondie101010>	of course there was
Feb 29 04:45:12 <lockywolf>	I didn't try that Lichtenstein dialer 
Feb 29 04:45:21 <Blondie101010>	you get to pay 500$ for a few minutes :)
Feb 29 04:45:28 <Thuryn>	lockywolf, it was this weird BBS back in the 90s that was basically a porn trading site
Feb 29 04:45:35 <lockywolf>	meh, I don't think they would send a bill to Russia
Feb 29 04:45:52 <chives>	Thuryn: thanks lets see....
Feb 29 04:45:53 <Blondie101010>	well your phone provider needs to pay their dues
Feb 29 04:46:00 <lockywolf>	but international calls cost a fortune, yes
Feb 29 04:46:04 <Thuryn>	it ran some software that I never saw before or since.  not WWIV.  not... the other common one at the time.  not like CompuServ.  something kind of unique.
Feb 29 04:46:05 <Blondie101010>	but regulations have improved
Feb 29 04:46:17 <lockywolf>	Blondie101010: I don't think that thing ever existed in Russia
Feb 29 04:46:38 <Blondie101010>	lockywolf:  doesn't seem relevant if you were able to do internal calls
Feb 29 04:46:48 <Blondie101010>	that's all that matters
Feb 29 04:46:51 <lockywolf>	a phone provider was every only allowed to charge you for the international calls
Feb 29 04:47:27 <Blondie101010>	yes, they charge you what is charged to them + profit margin
Feb 29 04:47:55 <Blondie101010>	and the scam was the country
Feb 29 04:48:03 <lockywolf>	I don't think that is how it worked in Russia. Prices were fixed for countries.
Feb 29 04:48:13 <lockywolf>	All of Lichtenstein=same price
Feb 29 04:48:21 <lockywolf>	All of the USA = same price
Feb 29 04:48:31 <Blondie101010>	ok, maybe, never been there :)
Feb 29 04:48:36 <Thuryn>	all right well good luck with your projects, y'all.  i gotta lseep.
Feb 29 04:48:38 <Thuryn>	see?
Feb 29 04:48:41 <Thuryn>	later.
Feb 29 04:48:54 <lockywolf>	Thuryn: I have never seen you
Feb 29 04:49:04 <lockywolf>	:D
Feb 29 04:49:06 <lockywolf>	nite
Feb 29 04:49:10 <Thuryn>	lockywolf, consider yourself lucky :D
Feb 29 04:49:25 <Thuryn>	o7
Feb 29 04:49:28 <lockywolf>	lseep sounds like some obscure x86_64 instruction
Feb 29 04:49:38 <lockywolf>	lseep $EAX, $EBX
Feb 29 04:49:52 <Thuryn>	slowly copies data from one register into other random ones
Feb 29 04:50:15 <lockywolf>	takes 8 hours to complete
Feb 29 04:50:28 <Thuryn>	okay for real.  night, all! X-D
Feb 29 04:51:36 *	Whiskey` sneaks up to Thuryn and tickle them
Feb 29 06:25:15 <chives>	Well lets see here, is apache going to work for udp requests?  its just an http proxy yes?
Feb 29 06:30:24 <chives>	not even sure if it can do socks4/5?
Feb 29 06:35:31 <Blondie101010>	your questions don't make sense...  http is rarely used on UDP
Feb 29 06:36:44 <Blondie101010>	it's designed to run over TCP
Feb 29 06:38:55 <chives>	I've got a linux box set up using tun2proxy which transparently proxies tcp requests (and dns which im using over tcp) successfully already.  I think it must be proxied over a socks4 server.  I have a Windows box where udp works, so I was thinking I could install a socks5 proxy there and just point tun2proxy to it, if I can find one on Windows.  I'm not sure Apache http server supports even tcp
Feb 29 06:38:57 <chives>	(that isnt http) let alone udp?
Feb 29 06:41:45 <Blondie101010>	you should read documentation
Feb 29 06:42:24 <ZLima12>	chives: what's the bigger picture here? What is your end goal?
Feb 29 06:45:18 <chives>	"full internet" on the linux box reliably, this morning i was wanting to use mosh on it which is udp, and ntp, just generally working internet on the linux both without having to worry about technicalities
Feb 29 06:45:47 <chives>	maybe nmap
Feb 29 06:45:53 <ZLima12>	I don't have background on the issue; why does it not have reliable internet normally?
Feb 29 06:47:27 <chives>	I guess I dont really understand your question, it doesnt because I havent been able to configure one for it yet
Feb 29 06:47:55 <grawity>	did all of this start with "simulates a router on windows"
Feb 29 06:48:25 <grawity>	why not turn windows into an actual router then if that's what you have to do
Feb 29 06:48:33 <grawity>	it has had ICS since like 1998?
Feb 29 06:49:33 <ZLima12>	Okay I was able to scroll up and yeah, sounds like your network architecture could be better
Feb 29 06:49:53 <ZLima12>	But I can say with confidence that adding lots of proxies is not going to help you achieve a reliable connection
Feb 29 06:50:53 <ZLima12>	If Windows isn't being a good router, then you should use a router that's meant to be a router, instead of trying to force the thing to work with proxies
Feb 29 06:52:52 <ZLima12>	But, if you must use Windows for some reason, then I'd say to figure out why it's not routing properly instead of trying to put a band-aid over the situation with proxies
Feb 29 06:53:36 <uwu>	y not just set up openvpn or wireguard
Feb 29 06:53:37 <chives>	I'm just trying a new route, because that route hasnt reliable.  Like I said, i used wingate and nat32 but you could tell from the way the dialogs were inconsistent that something was off... they did technically work in a manner of speaking but not well, windows works fine as is the way its set up
Feb 29 06:53:41 <chives>	been*
Feb 29 06:53:57 <grawity>	don't use wingate and nat32, use the built-in features windows already has
Feb 29 06:54:45 <chives>	without nat32 im not sure there's an interface for configuring ics in a way that wont break the setup of the "virtual" internet adapter
Feb 29 06:54:58 <grawity>	probably New-NetNat in powershell
Feb 29 06:55:16 <grawity>	it's what they now use for WSL2, not sure how it interacts with traditional ICS
Feb 29 06:56:03 <chives>	thats why i thinking maybe simplicity would be better instead of getting in to compatiblity issues with different softwares
Feb 29 06:56:08 <chives>	was*
Feb 29 06:57:52 <ZLima12>	Can't you make a bridge on Windows? If it's L2 shouldn't there be no problems?
Feb 29 07:00:21 <chives>	I'm not following on bridge, you wouldnt want to bridge a wan and lan
Feb 29 07:00:36 <grawity>	is your windows pc directly connected to wan
Feb 29 07:01:35 <chives>	there's a virtual wan adapter that tunnels the internet over the lan interface
Feb 29 07:01:39 <ZLima12>	Oh I see, so you're trying to use your PC as a router for your whole household?
Feb 29 07:02:29 <ZLima12>	What is the Windows PC physically connected to though
Feb 29 07:02:29 <chives>	I'm just looking for a socks5 proxy server that runs on windows, i can point the linux client to
Feb 29 07:08:52 <chives>	ZLima12: oh i just noticed your last message its wifi they're on on a wifi lan, the windows box has a proprietary program that creates the wan adapter to connect to the isp internet device... from a portscan on the device you find that there is what appears to be a socks4? proxy listening, i was thinking that was how the program interfaced with the internet device but im not sure now it may be
Feb 29 07:08:54 <chives>	some kind of vpn i guess
Feb 29 07:09:38 <chives>	but ive tried rocket science and failed so was thinking maybe that proxy server would be easier on the windows box
Feb 29 07:23:52 <chives>	well didnt realize he left
Feb 29 07:24:45 <chives>	that is the craziest thing after he said something about bridge google is prompting me to do a captcha on... bridges
Feb 29 07:25:21 <chives>	seems more and more like chatgpt these results seem preposterous
Feb 29 07:35:26 <chives>	that was just something for me to make it simple enough to explain though... there may be a better way to tunnel the traffic so that udp is supported
Feb 29 07:37:09 <chives>	to avoid the adapter specific routing weirdness and just let the"server" program listen on a port and route through the windows box default gateway
Feb 29 09:19:37 <user_____>	is there a standard/protocol for synchronizing leases across multiple dhcp servers? I saw RFC draft "DHCP failover protocol" from 2003 and nothing aside from this. Do I miss something?
Feb 29 09:20:28 <mlu>	user_____: no
Feb 29 09:20:31 <mlu>	user_____: why?
Feb 29 09:20:50 <mlu>	user_____: how reliable does your DHCP server need to be anyways?
Feb 29 09:21:07 <mlu>	user_____: in a modern setup, you'd just use SLAAC /w IPv6 and not have any of this BS
Feb 29 09:23:01 <Jaxef>	Hello. Anyone know a good source for reading about using databases like PostgreSQL with an external cache like redis?
Feb 29 09:23:03 <user_____>	use-case is router redundancy in IP4 enterprise network
Feb 29 09:23:05 <Gurkenglas>	Is there a protocol by which two people can establish that they are different people without revealing who they are? I would guess that there can't quite be a *zero* knowledge protocol, but maybe the knowledge can be bounded?
Feb 29 09:23:12 <Jaxef>	There are various caching strategies: Read-Through, Cache-Aside, Write-Through, Write-Back/Behind, Write-Around, Refresh-Ahead
Feb 29 09:23:25 <mlu>	Jaxef: first, why?
Feb 29 09:23:35 <Jaxef>	I'm just curious how it works
Feb 29 09:23:40 <Jaxef>	I find distributed systems fascinating
Feb 29 09:23:42 <mlu>	Jaxef: I can tell you this, as a user of both: the Redis cache is probably unnecessary complexity
Feb 29 09:23:50 <dminuoso>	user_____: Router redundancy has nothing to do with DHCP.
Feb 29 09:23:56 <Jaxef>	mlu what about memcached?
Feb 29 09:24:10 <mlu>	Jaxef: it's the same principles as any cache -- Redis stores keys/values, whereas you have to query from PostgreSQL
Feb 29 09:24:22 <mlu>	Jaxef: memcached is pretty much a redis that supports cache to disk
Feb 29 09:24:38 <mlu>	Jaxef: I suggest you learn how to use both -- they're both easy to pickup
Feb 29 09:24:41 <dminuoso>	user_____: That being said, various DHCP servers have some synchronization techniques, though most typically store leases in a relational database. So if you take something like postgresql, there's various ways of getting automatic failover.
Feb 29 09:25:45 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: That is a bit too nebulous to answer. What does "different people" mean exactly to you? What is an "identity"?
Feb 29 09:29:14 <Gurkenglas>	dminuoso: i'm not sure in what directions i need to be more specific. the point is to let humans anonymously make accounts, without letting one human make a million accounts.
Feb 29 09:30:03 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: Define what an "identity" really is.
Feb 29 09:30:09 <Gurkenglas>	if you make your *question* less nebulous, eg something that would have a numerical answer if i had made my definitions formal, i could try to answer that? :D
Feb 29 09:30:12 <dminuoso>	Do you identify a person by their DNA?
Feb 29 09:30:17 <dminuoso>	If yes, how do you deal with identical twins?
Feb 29 09:30:50 <Gurkenglas>	in this world, i suppose two people happen to be identical if and only if they occupy the same spacetime locations.
Feb 29 09:31:36 <mlu>	Gurkenglas: you've never had to work as fiduciary, have you? :D
Feb 29 09:32:18 <mlu>	i.e. mlu (treasurer of nonprofit) is not identical to mlu (person)
Feb 29 09:32:24 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: Well, in that case you would have to establish proof of a fermion system occupying some spacetime coordinates.
Feb 29 09:32:30 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: This becomes a quantum mechanics question.
Feb 29 09:32:35 <mlu>	even though both are the same person and occupying the same spacetime locations
Feb 29 09:32:53 <Gurkenglas>	mlu: nope! as you can see by my waltzing into the field like the physicist in https://xkcd.com/793/
Feb 29 09:32:57 <mlu>	or imagine establishing a personal trust
Feb 29 09:33:02 <dminuoso>	And it introduces issues relating to relativity, as having some exact spacetime coordinates that everybody can agree on is fundamentally impossible
Feb 29 09:33:24 <mlu>	what if I wanted to anycast myself across multiverses? :D
Feb 29 09:33:26 <Gurkenglas>	mlu: well, apparently i am talking about an equivalence relationship that identifies you with the million bots you control
Feb 29 09:33:30 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: Since: Whether or not you are at some spacetime coordinates depends on the observer.
Feb 29 09:33:37 <mlu>	Gurkenglas: yeah, you have different roles
Feb 29 09:33:46 <Gurkenglas>	so, ha, we could say that two people are defined identical iff they control each other's actions
Feb 29 09:33:49 <mlu>	how you define identity is necessarily contextual
Feb 29 09:34:15 <mlu>	Gurkenglas: does that mean that if I have a slave, the slave is identical to me?
Feb 29 09:34:22 <dminuoso>	The most useful definition of "identity" I can see is that of a passport identification number
Feb 29 09:34:29 <Gurkenglas>	dminuoso: afaic whether two spacetime coordinates are the same is independent of frame of reference
Feb 29 09:34:41 <Gurkenglas>	s/coordinates/locations
Feb 29 09:34:45 <dminuoso>	Some countries have digital passports with cryptography on them that you can use to prove your identity.
Feb 29 09:34:59 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: No, relativity is all about that being fundamentally impossible.
Feb 29 09:35:09 <dminuoso>	notably that there is no absolute spacetime coordinate system.
Feb 29 09:35:17 <dminuoso>	see things like relativity of simultaneity.
Feb 29 09:35:39 <dminuoso>	or just any lorentz transformation
Feb 29 09:35:50 <Gurkenglas>	mlu: no, he doesn't control your actions. but the protocol should eg forbid your slave from making an account, since there is someone that controls his actions.
Feb 29 09:36:05 <dminuoso>	Very easy to visualise in Minkowski diagrams.
Feb 29 09:36:22 <Gurkenglas>	dminuoso: Lorentz transformations preserve equality though
Feb 29 09:36:32 <dminuoso>	"equality" of what, exactly?
Feb 29 09:36:44 <dminuoso>	They just preserve causality.
Feb 29 09:36:46 <dminuoso>	Nothing more.
Feb 29 09:37:03 <Gurkenglas>	spacetime location. im not saying at what time something happens is Lorentz-invariant, im saying whether something is at the same space and the same time is Lorentz-invariant
Feb 29 09:37:23 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: you have no way of describing what that "spacetime" coordinate is
Feb 29 09:37:27 <dminuoso>	its observer dependent.
Feb 29 09:37:55 <dminuoso>	So if you refine your definition "identity is a human at a spacetime coordinate, from the perspective of the center of our sun", then sure we can use that  
Feb 29 09:38:03 <Gurkenglas>	what i'm saying is a corollary of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime#Spacetime_interval being Lorentz-invariant
Feb 29 09:38:27 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: Yup, which is just another way of saying that causality is not violated.
Feb 29 09:39:27 <Gurkenglas>	dminuoso: "identity is a human (...)" <- whether humans are identical is defined in terms of two humans at a time
Feb 29 09:39:49 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: the most useful definition of a human identity is that of a passport number, social security number, tax identification number, that sort of thing.
Feb 29 09:40:11 <Gurkenglas>	and whether they occupy the same points in spacetime is going to come out the same way whether you look at it from the sun or the moon or wherever
Feb 29 09:40:18 <dminuoso>	How it exactly relates to that bunch of fermions and bosons that make up your body, hard to say.
Feb 29 09:40:52 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: What does "the same spacetime coordinate from two observers" even mean?
Feb 29 09:40:56 <dminuoso>	Its a useless notion.
Feb 29 09:40:56 <Gurkenglas>	dminuoso: sure, we can go with passports. can we use passports to let people make accounts, but not a million accounts, without leaking their passport?
Feb 29 09:41:13 <dminuoso>	See relativity of simultaneity.
Feb 29 09:41:30 <dminuoso>	Whether or not two events happen simultaenous depends *entirely* on the observer.
Feb 29 09:41:59 <dminuoso>	We dont have any fundamental notion of "same place" or "same time". That's the central accomplishment of Einsteins theory of relativity.
Feb 29 09:42:06 <dminuoso>	Its all observer dependent.
Feb 29 09:42:06 <Gurkenglas>	i am aware of the basic mistake of drawing "simultaneity" slices through spacetime, and wasn't doing that
Feb 29 09:42:18 <dminuoso>	09:40:56    Gurkenglas │ dminuoso: sure, we can go with passports. can we use passports to let people make accounts, but not a million accounts, without leaking their passport?
Feb 29 09:42:20 <dminuoso>	Yes.
Feb 29 09:42:36 <dminuoso>	Basic cryptographic schemes using asymmetric encryption schemes.
Feb 29 09:43:04 <dminuoso>	X.509 certificates are a simple mechanism for exactly that
Feb 29 09:43:08 <dminuoso>	Is that what you are looking for, maybe?
Feb 29 09:43:34 <Gurkenglas>	surely the government could try each of the <10 billion passports to see if one of them hashes to the contents of the public comms channel?
Feb 29 09:44:13 <dminuoso>	If each passport contained a government signed X.509 certificate, then using that certificate you can prove your identity
Feb 29 09:45:07 <Gurkenglas>	that gives the government the ability to see when you use it, right? can we avoid that?
Feb 29 09:45:18 <mlu>	no
Feb 29 09:45:19 <dminuoso>	No?
Feb 29 09:45:32 <mlu>	you can verify a X509 certificate by just verifying the signature
Feb 29 09:45:32 <dminuoso>	The x.509 certificate would be physically in your passport.
Feb 29 09:45:35 <mlu>	there's no contact with the issuer
Feb 29 09:45:40 <Gurkenglas>	huh, okay, i'll read up on that and get back
Feb 29 09:46:26 <Gurkenglas>	(mlu: i didnt imply contact with the issuer, just: if the issuer gets to watch the transmission, they can identify that the certificate they gave to *you* was used)
Feb 29 09:46:49 <mlu>	Gurkenglas: no, they can't identify that either
Feb 29 09:47:49 <mlu>	Gurkenglas: of course, you need to show the certificate to the other party, but you can establish some encrypted communication first
Feb 29 09:48:13 <Gurkenglas>	mlu: suppose the other party could be the issuer with a mustache on
Feb 29 09:48:27 <mlu>	Gurkenglas: mutual identification :)
Feb 29 09:48:54 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: And no, they cant identify that fact either - depending on how the X.509 certificate was generated.
Feb 29 09:49:04 <Gurkenglas>	mlu: i mean, suppose the government founded the other party because they wanted to know which people use such services.
Feb 29 09:49:34 <mlu>	you'd just issue each other x509 certs in that case :)
Feb 29 09:49:48 <dminuoso>	Gurkenglas: If you as the citizen generate the X.509 certificate and have it signed by the government on issuing the passport, then the government has no knowledge of your private key.
Feb 29 09:49:51 <mlu>	Gurkenglas: you familiar with the concept of web of trust, as used in PGP?
Feb 29 09:50:08 <mlu>	the government only acts as a notary in this case
Feb 29 09:50:14 <dminuoso>	Yup
Feb 29 09:50:23 <dminuoso>	It just requires that *you* create the X.509 certificate to begin with
Feb 29 09:50:31 <mlu>	i.e. for local development, I have a wildcard cert for my domain signed by LetsEncrypt
Feb 29 09:50:33 <dminuoso>	If of course the government creates it themselves... well..
Feb 29 09:50:39 <dminuoso>	It becomes a trust issue.
Feb 29 09:50:44 <Gurkenglas>	setting aside that this wasn't supposed to give you full info about who the other person is, how would knowing who the other person is tell you whether the government is paying them
Feb 29 09:50:49 <rustyaxe>	thats the problem tho, the government being the issuer would always have the private keys
Feb 29 09:50:53 <mlu>	LetsEncrypt has no idea when or where I use the certificate (and in practice, I use it on my intranet)
Feb 29 09:51:04 <dminuoso>	rustyaxe: Well they dont necessarily have them.
Feb 29 09:51:09 <mlu>	LetsEncrypt only issued it because I was able to prove that I control that domain on the internet
Feb 29 09:51:30 <mlu>	and if I really wanted to be ultra secure (instead of just convenient), I'd just be my own CA
Feb 29 09:51:40 <mlu>	but LetsEncrypt root was good enough for my purposes of convenience
Feb 29 09:51:49 <dminuoso>	rustyaxe: Its just physically possible for them to know/store them - whether they actually retrieve/store that key is a different matter entirely.
Feb 29 09:51:54 <dminuoso>	(Again, its a trust issue)
Feb 29 09:52:09 <dminuoso>	But then again, all PKIs have assumed trust.
Feb 29 09:52:18 <mlu>	yep, trust is a separate issue from identity :)
Feb 29 09:52:28 *	mlu marginally trusts LetsEncrypt
Feb 29 09:52:44 <dminuoso>	mlu: Honestly, in the LetsEncrypt world LetsEncrypt is the least of my worries.
Feb 29 09:52:48 *	mlu also marginally trusts the government of China, even though he shouldn't
Feb 29 09:52:56 <dminuoso>	Your shitty DNS provider.. thats probably the biggest gaping security hole nobody talks about.
Feb 29 09:53:03 <mlu>	hehehe
Feb 29 09:53:19 <dminuoso>	The kind of garbage duck taping I have seen in domain selling world...
Feb 29 09:53:48 <dminuoso>	How domain registries use 30 year old PHP driven email APIs to automate interaction...
Feb 29 09:54:35 <dminuoso>	And another thing to consider, is that domains are not owned.
Feb 29 09:54:36 <dminuoso>	They are rentals.
Feb 29 09:54:46 <dminuoso>	Tying trust to domains is probably an incredibly stupid idea.
Feb 29 10:26:03 <stallmanator>	Reventlov: I ran traceroute today
Feb 29 10:26:37 <stallmanator>	2 hops, one is the gateway then the target device
Feb 29 10:28:26 <stallmanator>	Although earlier the devices were on the same subnet, today they seemed to be different
Feb 29 11:08:37 <rustyaxe>	            Vendor-Class (60), length 27: "Linux 2.4.17_mvl21-cllf ppc" -- wut the hell is this antique?
Feb 29 11:10:47 <nshire>	what kind of device is this rustyaxe 
Feb 29 11:17:41 <dminuoso>	Sounds like a very expensive AI powered security appliance.
Feb 29 13:24:12 <Dex2x>	amazing how in 2024, we still have crappy wifi in offices and either teams or the combo, but the delay is just horrible when someone is sharing a screen 
Feb 29 13:29:29 <scottpedia>	Dex2x: yes
Feb 29 13:30:02 <scottpedia>	i have a very personal sensation against the use of online conference services
Feb 29 13:33:32 <scottpedia>	what's the magic of ipv6?
Feb 29 13:33:44 <scottpedia>	is there a clear reason why I should use ipv6?
Feb 29 13:34:15 <anddam>	howdy, I am on windows 11 Home trying to connect to mysql at 127.0.0.1:3306, the server forbids me because the credentials I am using are for @localhost where apparently I am connecting from 172.17.0.1 
Feb 29 13:34:31 <anddam>	considering this is my network setup https://termbin.com/tnta where is that 172.17.0.1 coming from??
Feb 29 13:35:09 <anddam>	the two Hyper-V vNIC are 172.{22,24} and netmask is 255.255. so I know that's outside the networks
Feb 29 13:51:04 <Blondie101010>	anddam: aren't you the one who set up your DB access?
Feb 29 13:51:58 <realivanjx>	will there be any support for cifs mount over quic since windows now has smb over quic?
Feb 29 13:52:51 <Blondie101010>	scottpedia:  you use ipv6 to reach ipv6 hosts, including your own...  it is not a matter of personal choice but a step in the Internet evolution..  no one is forcing you to even remain connected
Feb 29 13:53:37 <scottpedia>	Blondie101010: yeah but they say ipv6 has magick
Feb 29 13:53:53 <Blondie101010>	who?
Feb 29 13:54:01 <anddam>	Blondie101010: yes, mysql is running in a docker container and that 172.17 address is the docker network gateway, I think it makes sense, I'll just use 'user'@'%'
Feb 29 13:54:07 <Blondie101010>	"they say" mostly refers to dumb people
Feb 29 13:54:10 <scottpedia>	a bunch of people i met on irc Blondie101010 
Feb 29 13:54:48 <scottpedia>	that "every device has a unique address" and shit Blondie101010 
Feb 29 13:54:58 <Blondie101010>	anddam:  you can't use the real source IP?
Feb 29 13:55:14 <Blondie101010>	scottpedia:  yes ok so?
Feb 29 13:55:22 <Blondie101010>	and there is no magic
Feb 29 13:55:35 <Blondie101010>	that is not a sane approach to learning things
Feb 29 13:55:44 <scottpedia>	ok
Feb 29 13:55:54 <scottpedia>	insane it is
Feb 29 13:56:11 <Blondie101010>	well you already demonstrated a very low IQ
Feb 29 13:56:14 <Blondie101010>	so it would fit
Feb 29 13:57:56 <Blondie101010>	scottg489: in what context do you have to choose to adhere to ipv6 or not?
Feb 29 13:58:05 <Blondie101010>	that is already a very unusual situation to be in
Feb 29 13:58:24 <Blondie101010>	especially for someone who doesn't know what they're asking

Feb 29 14:30:11 <scottpedia>	for now at least
Feb 29 14:30:43 <Blondie101010>	users don't typically choose the protocols they use
Feb 29 14:31:15 <Blondie101010>	anyways, does your ISP offer ipv6?
Feb 29 14:33:50 <Blondie101010>	considering that you don't really know what it is, we should be able to assume you didn't touch your router configs and it would simply pick it up and get you both v4 and v6 IPs
Feb 29 14:36:12 <scottpedia>	Blondie101010: no. we had ipv6 around 2019 or so
Feb 29 14:36:32 <scottpedia>	i disabled it somehow during a maintenance run
Feb 29 14:36:42 <scottpedia>	i am considering to bring it back
Feb 29 14:37:39 <Blondie101010>	why did you disable it?

Feb 29 14:40:07 <Blondie101010>	the way you describe it makes it sound like it happened due to some magic event :/
Feb 29 14:40:17 <djph>	Blondie101010: sufficiently advanced technology ... 
Feb 29 14:40:20 <scottpedia>	no. i re-configured it.
Feb 29 14:40:37 <Blondie101010>	why did you previously bridge it and then unbridged it?
Feb 29 14:40:39 <scottpedia>	i just think perhaps i should bring back ipv6 by making the router handle the pppoe
Feb 29 14:41:09 <scottpedia>	it was by chance that i needed that kind of setup for some experimentations or maintenance
Feb 29 14:41:26 <Blondie101010>	doing the PPPoE from the router effectively has the same effect as bridging the modem
Feb 29 14:41:46 <Blondie101010>	so you just need to change your router's WAN 
Feb 29 14:41:55 <scottpedia>	yes but the modem doesn't support ipv6 stack
Feb 29 14:42:04 <Blondie101010>	but do make sure its LAN subnet is different
Feb 29 14:42:08 <scottpedia>	so in the modem's subnet there's no ipv6
Feb 29 14:42:22 <scottpedia>	right will do
Feb 29 14:42:31 <Blondie101010>	I can only rely on the bits of information you gave
Feb 29 14:42:54 <Blondie101010>	no device that's less than 20 years old doesn't support ipv6
Feb 29 14:43:12 <scottpedia>	right i think so
Feb 29 14:43:23 <scottpedia>	so i will do that perhaps next week
Feb 29 14:43:44 <Blondie101010>	are you really sure your ISP gives you v6?
Feb 29 14:43:55 <Blondie101010>	anyways, you'll find out when you try
Feb 29 14:44:07 <scottpedia>	yeah. it's like real ipv6. cause i did the tests and everything
Feb 29 14:44:16 <Blondie101010>	ok
Feb 29 14:45:29 <scottpedia>	v6's kind of cool
Feb 29 14:45:40 <scottpedia>	with a longer address and all that
Feb 29 14:46:06 <djph>	thatsthepoint.jpg
Feb 29 14:48:46 <Blondie101010>	though it was designed while y2k was at its peak, I'm rather convinced that v6 will also become unsuitable before we die
Feb 29 14:49:05 <Thuryn>	^
Feb 29 14:49:10 <koollman>	I think that's optimistic
Feb 29 14:49:23 <djph>	Blondie101010: I don't think we can dump "quite" that many devices onto the internet
Feb 29 14:49:32 <Thuryn>	then again, ipv4 was designed 60 years ago and it's still quite viable
Feb 29 14:49:35 <koollman>	how much longuer do you expect to live ? :)
Feb 29 14:49:40 <Thuryn>	djph, it's not about the number of devices
Feb 29 14:49:41 <Blondie101010>	:)
Feb 29 14:49:44 <djph>	maybe the idea that "every network is a /64" will die ... 
Feb 29 14:49:49 <Thuryn>	it's about people's ability to screw up allocations
Feb 29 14:49:54 <Blondie101010>	but indeed, my point is more about the allocations
Feb 29 14:50:06 <Thuryn>	like with ipv4
Feb 29 14:50:14 <Thuryn>	why did 0/8 and 127/8 need to be /8?
Feb 29 14:50:16 <Thuryn>	that was stupid
Feb 29 14:50:17 <djph>	Arent the allocations right now limited to the first tenth or such of the entire space?
Feb 29 14:50:31 <Thuryn>	djph, that's the point (.jpg)
Feb 29 14:50:40 <djph>	Thuryn: heh
Feb 29 14:50:46 <Thuryn>	we've already used up 10% of that incredibly large addressing space
Feb 29 14:51:05 <djph>	Thuryn: we have?  
Feb 29 14:51:09 <scottpedia>	eventually perhaps they will start doing nat over v6
Feb 29 14:51:21 <Thuryn>	scottpedia, we already are, but not due to address exhaustion
Feb 29 14:51:31 <scottpedia>	okay
Feb 29 14:51:39 <djph>	Thuryn: I was unaware we've jumped into the "second 10%" (whatever) of the v6 space
Feb 29 14:51:51 <Blondie101010>	but it is quite uncommon, and only on the server side, unlike v4 NAT use
Feb 29 14:51:54 <Thuryn>	djph, oh i didn't mean it that way
Feb 29 14:52:12 <djph>	Thuryn: ah. 
Feb 29 14:52:18 <Thuryn>	well, IPv6 NAT is used when you have two entities that use local address spaces that then need to talk to each other.
Feb 29 14:52:25 <Thuryn>	fec0:: and so on
Feb 29 14:53:16 <Blondie101010>	or load balancing, though there are better ways to handle it for most protocols
Feb 29 14:53:22 <Thuryn>	^
Feb 29 14:54:01 <Thuryn>	i much prefer setting up load balancers as reverse proxies, or migrating to address spaces that don't collide (even if it takes years). 
Feb 29 14:54:31 <Thuryn>	i've been at $current_employer for six years and I'm ALMOST got them off of 172.16.0.0/16
Feb 29 14:54:39 <Thuryn>	(yes it was one big /16 VLAN...)
Feb 29 14:54:43 <Thuryn>	(i was appalled)
Feb 29 14:54:48 <scottpedia>	if there some kind of library that will allow you to emulate virtual interfaces across different hosts in a native os environment?
Feb 29 14:55:05 <dminuoso>	Thuryn: You mean IPv6 NAT is used when you have two entities that didn't use ULA.
Feb 29 14:55:06 <Blondie101010>	Thuryn:  is your point that they were using a single large LAN?
Feb 29 14:55:07 <djph>	I'm looking at it as if with v4 (and assuming classless never existed, because ew) was originally handed out ONLY in 1/4 (for example) ... 
Feb 29 14:55:18 <dminuoso>	As usual, NAT is a technology for poor network decisions - most of the time.
Feb 29 14:55:31 <scottpedia>	it's like the way cisco packet tracer is implemented, sort of like sandbox environment
Feb 29 14:55:39 <Thuryn>	dminuoso, eh.  fec0:: was legit at one time
Feb 29 14:55:48 <Thuryn>	and legacy things have a way of becoming "legacy"
Feb 29 14:56:03 <Thuryn>	Blondie101010, not just one big VLAN for everything, but a /16 address space inside it
Feb 29 14:56:04 <Blondie101010>	djph:  it was allocated blindly, giving entities millions times more IPs than they needed
Feb 29 14:56:10 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: Linux.
Feb 29 14:56:18 <scottpedia>	i wonder if linux iptables would suffice for that purpose
Feb 29 14:56:26 <Blondie101010>	for what?
Feb 29 14:56:36 <djph>	Blondie101010: I know :).  Arguably the same with v6 and giving every Network a /64
Feb 29 14:56:39 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: There is a lot of network simulation and tests by just running Linux on VMs.
Feb 29 14:56:45 <Blondie101010>	djph:  yes, that's our point
Feb 29 14:56:52 <Thuryn>	^
Feb 29 14:57:07 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: yes but i'd rather like to do that without actually launching vms
Feb 29 14:57:08 <Thuryn>	although at least with ipv6, the /64 network has reasoning behind it
Feb 29 14:57:18 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: Mind my asking, why?
Feb 29 14:57:35 <djph>	Blondie101010: but, AIUI, we're only doing that with the first tenth of hte address space, and not going "lolol, the first HALF of the space is for 'big networks', and then the next quarter is 'slightly smaller networks' and then ... "
Feb 29 14:57:36 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: The linux kernel itself is not something that is (most of the time) running. In that sense, a VM does not really cost much.
Feb 29 14:57:37 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: it's an application that we are developing
Feb 29 14:57:52 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: So as long as you control your init carefully, a VM can be extremely cheap.
Feb 29 14:58:02 <Thuryn>	gotta run.  have fun, all
Feb 29 14:58:06 <djph>	Thuryn: take care
Feb 29 14:58:29 <scottpedia>	ok that can be considered but i am wondering if my purpose can be fulfilled using iptables and basically linux networking stack djph 
Feb 29 14:58:31 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: 
Feb 29 14:58:37 <djph>	scottpedia: eh?
Feb 29 14:59:02 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: The thing is, linux faithfully simulates linux.
Feb 29 14:59:06 <Blondie101010>	scottpedia:  what is the question about iptables?
Feb 29 14:59:30 <grawity>	tbh if we were to hand out a single IPv4 /32 to each network – *including* the massive datacenters that currently eat up multiple /8's – we would probably still have ipv4 to spare
Feb 29 14:59:34 <Blondie101010>	it's a regular stateful firewall that's used on most networking devices
Feb 29 14:59:53 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: i understand what you mean by just launching vms for that. but is there a way that's gonna work more similarly to tun/tap
Feb 29 15:00:01 <djph>	Blondie101010: Note that I'm not saying they've done v6 allocations "optimally" by any means ... but there's still 90% of the space globally available to do better ... 
Feb 29 15:00:03 <scottpedia>	like not involving the use of VM
Feb 29 15:00:08 <djph>	grawity: um, a v4 /32?
Feb 29 15:00:13 <Blondie101010>	grawity:  it wouldn't suffice to get rid of NAT, but your point has some value
Feb 29 15:00:14 <scottpedia>	particularly i am worrying about the resource usage
Feb 29 15:00:15 <grawity>	djph: yeah, a single ipv4 address
Feb 29 15:00:24 <mercenary>	scottpedia: have you looked at network namespaces?
Feb 29 15:00:29 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: Well what does "different hosts" even mean to you?
Feb 29 15:00:31 <djph>	um, so lots of NAT then?
Feb 29 15:00:41 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: simulated hosts
Feb 29 15:00:41 <grawity>	djph: because that's approximately the same % of overall space as giving each network an ipv6 /32
Feb 29 15:00:49 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: Again, what does "host" really mean to you?
Feb 29 15:00:54 <dminuoso>	Just a process thats doing networking?
Feb 29 15:00:55 <scottpedia>	have you used cisco packet tracer before dminuoso ?
Feb 29 15:00:59 <dminuoso>	Or a multitude of processes?
Feb 29 15:01:13 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: a process
Feb 29 15:01:23 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: then you dont need anything. linux, networking, done.
Feb 29 15:01:24 <scottpedia>	a host = a process, then yes
Feb 29 15:01:39 <Blondie101010>	what
Feb 29 15:01:41 <scottpedia>	mercenary: no. would you elaborate?
Feb 29 15:01:41 <dminuoso>	two processes can talk to each other via networking on a linux server.
Feb 29 15:02:04 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: you talking about localhosts?
Feb 29 15:02:26 <scottpedia>	but i need a fully simulated virtual network adapter
Feb 29 15:02:27 <grawity>	scottpedia: what was the original goal, I missed
Feb 29 15:02:31 <djph>	grawity: So you're suggesting that instead of /64 as the "standard network size", a better default-network-allocation would have been /32 ?
Feb 29 15:02:43 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: you can have multiple interfaces on linux.
Feb 29 15:02:44 <grawity>	djph: no, I mean /32 is already the current default-network-allocation
Feb 29 15:02:46 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: See https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/10/22/introduction-to-linux-interfaces-for-virtual-networking
Feb 29 15:03:02 <djph>	grawity: it is?  I though v6 was /64 ?
Feb 29 15:03:03 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: okay that can be helpful thx 
Feb 29 15:03:08 <grawity>	djph: /64 is individual subnet
Feb 29 15:03:24 <grawity>	but the whole organization or LIR or whatever, gets a /32 by default
Feb 29 15:03:27 <mercenary>	scottpedia: can't condense a bunch of man pages in irc, but basically put interfaces in their own little sandbox
Feb 29 15:03:30 <djph>	*facepalm* I'm going about this backwards
Feb 29 15:03:41 <djph>	coffee is not nearly strong enough
Feb 29 15:03:42 <scottpedia>	mercenary: yes exactly that's what i want
Feb 29 15:03:47 <scottpedia>	sandboxes
Feb 29 15:04:07 <grawity>	and people keep treating it like somehow wastes more space than an ipv4 /32 when it's the same %
Feb 29 15:04:28 <scottpedia>	mercenary: ohh you talking about network namespaces?
Feb 29 15:04:39 <djph>	grawity: Okay, so replace all ipv4 allocations with single IP addresses is approximately the same allocation (percentage-of-space wise) as giving all of them v6 /32s
Feb 29 15:04:44 <scottpedia>	i will look into it thx
Feb 29 15:06:12 <djph>	grawity: that makes sense, TBH.  Although using a /64 for individual subnets still seems way silly big.  I need a bigger network :)
Feb 29 15:06:26 <grawity>	it does look a bit silly when ipv6 /16's or even ipv6 /12's are given out... but at this rate, it's still nowhere near the amount of ipv4 /16's
Feb 29 15:09:59 <djph>	grawity: you happen to know what the reasoning behind /64s was?  I mean an individual /96 is like hte entire ipv4 address space already ... 
Feb 29 15:10:37 <grawity>	I don't know for sure, but I've a pretty strong guess it was the whole "MAC address suffix" influence from OSI and ATM (and IPX? did IPX exist at the time?)
Feb 29 15:11:03 <grawity>	since NSAP addresses looked a whole lot like ipv6, AFAIK even with /prefixlen syntax
Feb 29 15:13:23 <djph>	hm, makes sense since the mac-addr stuff is what, 56 bits or something?
Feb 29 15:13:43 <djph>	well, 48 bit mac addr + the whatever in the middle

Feb 29 15:18:32 <grawity>	djph: don't forget they're kinda running out of OUIs for 48-bit MACs
Feb 29 15:18:48 <grawity>	so they probably wanted to plan for EUI64 at that point already
Feb 29 15:20:50 <djph>	grawity: yeah, we're running out of everything
Feb 29 15:30:21 <mercenary>	And since they started allocating OUIs randomly so fly-by-night operations couldn't grab one that 'won't be allocated in the next 5 years', they probably can't go 'for this block of OUIs we move to 32-bit OUI and 16-bit vendor space'
Feb 29 15:39:45 <grawity>	they do allocate 32-bit OUIs and 16-bit vendor space, don't they?
Feb 29 15:51:39 <mercenary>	24/24, afaik
Feb 29 15:52:47 <mercenary>	https://standards-oui.ieee.org/
Feb 29 15:54:27 <grawity>	you can get a 24/24 or 28/20 or 36/12 depending on how much you pay
Feb 29 15:54:53 <grawity>	apparently no 32/16 though
Feb 29 15:58:01 <mercenary>	til. I would have thought 32/16 would be a logical thing, but apparently not so
Feb 29 15:58:26 <mercenary>	Used to be that everything was just 24/24
Feb 29 17:31:14 <tomman>	hai guys
Feb 29 17:31:32 <tomman>	https://imgur.com/a/prcuxzh should I kill this rats nest with fire, bring a nuke, or bail the fuck out of it? :D
Feb 29 17:31:38 <tomman>	went to check the port labeling
Feb 29 17:31:43 <tomman>	found... a new layer of insanity
Feb 29 17:32:03 <tomman>	not pictured: 10+ other assorted TP-Stink APs
Feb 29 17:32:27 <tomman>	apparently every time a network jack died at these offices, they just bought a new AP instead of repairing the jack
Feb 29 17:32:48 <tomman>	ironically that means they can't get better network isolation than this
Feb 29 17:33:07 <tomman>	but yeeeeeeeah, I'm not deploying switches on this mess
Feb 29 17:33:31 <tomman>	the IT slaves know it's a mess, but they're underfunded. The manager believes IT are lazy slaves
Feb 29 17:33:53 <tomman>	Oh, the ceiling is damaged over that rack because of a WATER LEAK
Feb 29 17:34:21 <tomman>	the IT slaves want either $$$ and more slaves, or outsource the whole thing
Feb 29 17:37:33 <tomman>	what you're seeing in those pictures are 10+ years of neglect, typical from our public offices :/
Feb 29 17:41:21 <djph>	tomman: all three
Feb 29 17:42:15 <tomman>	"Rats chewed the wires" => "we have no cable crimping tools, let's buy a consoomer switch then!"
Feb 29 17:42:49 <Cowclops>	mice chewed through our internet fiber line at one of our locations three times in one week
Feb 29 17:42:55 <Cowclops>	spectrum was getting pretty pissed to have to keep coming back
Feb 29 17:42:58 <tomman>	Outsourcing the whole thing is tempting, but sadly finding local providers for that is difficult, and they most likely will want to charge San Francisco price tiers
Feb 29 17:43:05 <Cowclops>	The one thing one of the dickshit store employees did was put rat poison in the rack
Feb 29 17:43:07 <Cowclops>	thats BAIT
Feb 29 17:43:11 <Cowclops>	its also POISON
Feb 29 17:43:19 <tomman>	:D
Feb 29 17:43:23 <djph>	bit it's also BAIT
Feb 29 17:43:25 <Cowclops>	So first off it entices mice to come AND its putting poison on things 
Feb 29 17:43:30 <Cowclops>	Like yes ideally they die
Feb 29 17:43:35 <Cowclops>	but you don't put the bait where you don't want the rodents tob e
Feb 29 17:43:51 <tomman>	Oh, I figured out the origin of that 'tik box
Feb 29 17:43:59 <Cowclops>	I think they eventually filled it up with mothballs and wrapped the exposed part of it in aluminum foil
Feb 29 17:44:07 <djph>	tomman: internet
Feb 29 17:44:15 <tomman>	they indeed got from their fiber ISP, apparently one of their netops folks managed to score one for them
Feb 29 17:44:24 <tomman>	there were plans to use it for the VLAN stuff, but... well, here we are
Feb 29 17:44:24 <Cowclops>	And speaking of animals chewing things, like 10 minutes ago my wife was like "oh shit"
Feb 29 17:44:30 <Cowclops>	dog was chewing the remote for our bedroom tv lol
Feb 29 17:44:37 <Cowclops>	thats the first time he "got" a remote and did some doggodamage to it
Feb 29 17:44:41 <Cowclops>	he's 8 months old
Feb 29 17:44:41 <tomman>	djph: none of our ISPs issue such nice gear
Feb 29 17:44:45 <tomman>	it's all V-Sol trash
Feb 29 17:44:52 <djph>	hah
Feb 29 17:44:54 <djph>	fair enough
Feb 29 17:45:21 <Cowclops>	Oh a couple of former coworkers stopped by to say hi yesterday, they went back to working for NYS and one guy was like "goin to install two cisco 9200 48 port switches today"
Feb 29 17:45:27 <tomman>	anyway, next week I have a  meeting with the managers, the head of IT and his lead slave, and another of our external consultants
Feb 29 17:45:33 <Cowclops>	i'm like "Whats funny is one of those switches costs more than the entire rack of ubiquitis we have next door"
Feb 29 17:45:37 <tomman>	I'll need to bring a fire extinguisher
Feb 29 17:45:45 <tomman>	because sparks will fly for sure
Feb 29 17:46:04 <Cowclops>	The concept of enterprise gear is interesting because often times you're paying for functionality you don't need. But sometimes, there's functionality you do need thats legitimately only available on substantially morte expensive products.
Feb 29 17:46:26 <Cowclops>	No simple "Cisco is always a waste of money" or "Unifi is alw ays good enough" rule there. 
Feb 29 17:47:02 <Cowclops>	switches that are just acting as access ports for a low bandwidth small to medium business network probably don't benefit from a $7000 cisco
Feb 29 17:47:03 <tomman>	Oh, they had some Cisco switches
Feb 29 17:47:05 <tomman>	they weren't dead
Feb 29 17:47:16 <tomman>	they are, according to the slaves, "useless without Cisco gear"
Feb 29 17:47:35 <tomman>	(at some point they did had Cisco shit, but of course the only remaining bits were a couple of switches)
Feb 29 17:47:55 <Cowclops>	but an ISP isn't going to have any luck using unifi as part of a big routed network
Feb 29 17:49:04 <tomman>	Anyway, I'm stuck again
Feb 29 17:49:10 <tomman>	no network map is possible at this stage
Feb 29 17:49:17 <tomman>	just more wishful thinking
Feb 29 17:53:18 <mercenary>	tomman: wait, 3com? you may be able to extract some antiques value there.
Feb 29 17:54:09 <tomman>	that 3Com supposedly is also good, they keep it as a emergency spare
Feb 29 17:54:31 <tomman>	the TP-Links are new (sadly they are not managed), but the Lanpros are ancient and have been repaired many times
Feb 29 17:55:12 <tomman>	the idea was to keep the TP-Links (since they're gigabit), put some managed ones on top, and call it a day
Feb 29 17:55:32 <tomman>	but after seeing that xmas tree arrangement, weeeeeell....
Feb 29 17:55:36 <tomman>	This Changes Everything™
Feb 29 18:01:02 <mercenary>	tomman: not really. I'd start with going in after-hours with 2 or 3 people with radios, playing the 'unplug cable, see where a link drops' game. In an hour you will have the interconnects between the switches.
Feb 29 18:02:07 <tomman>	The IT guys already got that part done
Feb 29 18:02:10 <tomman>	more or less
Feb 29 18:02:35 <tomman>	but even with that apparently some offices have no Internet access whatsoever, despite being into a LAN
Feb 29 18:02:48 <tomman>	maybe there is some misconfiguration in the way too
Feb 29 18:03:49 <tomman>	I guess another good option would be that instead of having every single jack going to a central rack, have distributed switches
Feb 29 18:04:12 <tomman>	dunno why they insisted on centralizing everything on two racks, that's a massive waste of cable
Feb 29 18:05:14 <tomman>	say, every 3-4 offices share one 16-24 port switch (and for some of the offices it doesn't even have to be a managed one)
Feb 29 18:05:22 <inviz>	Hello. I am thinking of getting second hand Aristas DCS-7050SX/DCS-7050QC for office lab. for learning leaf-spine. will I hit any issues like licencing? I need macsec/acl features.
Feb 29 18:05:29 <mercenary>	until you have to debug things. you will keep running between switches
Feb 29 18:06:12 <scottpedia>	mercenary: what kind of radio?
Feb 29 18:07:10 <mercenary>	any 2-way
Feb 29 18:07:46 <scottpedia>	like which band?
Feb 29 18:08:37 <tomman>	mercenary: of course keeping the chaining of switches within sane limits
Feb 29 18:08:43 <mercenary>	whatever is free, or you have a license for. It's inside one building, so the lower freq the better
Feb 29 18:09:26 <tomman>	but having 40+ 100m cable runs to a central switch is not my idea of fun (plus the Money Folks™ will complain at the costs)
Feb 29 18:09:48 <scottpedia>	mercenary: so how do you play with it?
Feb 29 18:10:05 <tomman>	They want to isolate two of the core departments, so that's at least ~20 machines
Feb 29 18:10:15 <tomman>	so one (unmanaged) switch for each
Feb 29 18:10:46 <mercenary>	scottpedia: one person at each rack. Call 'switch 1 port 1'. See if anybody calls 'switch 3 port 5 light went off'. Have someone record that.
Feb 29 18:11:07 <mercenary>	Repeat for each port.
Feb 29 18:11:25 <scottpedia>	ok
Feb 29 18:12:53 <kurahaupo>	If the racks are close enough together you don't need radios, you can just shout at each other
Feb 29 18:13:10 <tomman>	This is a two-floor building, with somewhat separate wings
Feb 29 18:13:26 <mercenary>	yup. but sometimes you get racks on different floors, etc.
Feb 29 18:13:34 <tomman>	one rack is on the upper floor of a wing, the other rack (the one with the leaky ceiling) is downstairs, at the other wing
Feb 29 18:14:01 <tomman>	the rack upstairs covers a entire wing, the other covers the other wing
Feb 29 18:14:02 <kurahaupo>	When we say "Radio", think "walkie talkie"
Feb 29 18:14:23 <tomman>	kurahaupo: or just send voice notes over WhatsCrapp like kids do :D
Feb 29 18:14:40 <kurahaupo>	But you could just do a conference call on mobile phones
Feb 29 18:15:33 <kurahaupo>	"Some kind of communication channel that does not depend on the network that's being investigated"
Feb 29 18:15:47 <mercenary>	that too. iff you have good coverage throughout the building (remember, can't use the wifi because you are sometimes breaking that)
Feb 29 18:16:13 <scottpedia>	mercenary: so you working at some DC?
Feb 29 18:16:36 <mercenary>	scottpedia: no. but I have done this sort of job in the past
Feb 29 18:16:48 <scottpedia>	ok. 
Feb 29 18:17:12 <tomman>	Anyway, I stopped counting TP-Link APs after the 13th
Feb 29 18:17:12 <scottpedia>	are you still in IT? mercenary 
Feb 29 18:17:21 <tomman>	each one a different model
Feb 29 18:17:38 <tomman>	from low end Atheros classics to nice Archers
Feb 29 18:17:52 <tomman>	most of them were bought in the last 3-4 years!
Feb 29 18:18:23 <tomman>	(one of the offices had a Asus AP, they actually intended to deploy that one at another building)
Feb 29 18:18:31 <mercenary>	scottpedia: mercenaries work in whatever brings money, be that IT, 'consulting', or whatever else
Feb 29 18:18:50 <scottpedia>	so you are literally a mercenary?
Feb 29 18:19:07 <tomman>	Of course, the next nightmare after exorcising this network of  clusterfucks will be securing the actual workstations
Feb 29 18:19:09 <mercenary>	The politically correct term is 'self-employed'
Feb 29 18:19:10 <tomman>	that will be fun
Feb 29 18:19:22 <Cowclops>	deadpool is a mercenary
Feb 29 18:19:24 <Cowclops>	is he available for IT work
Feb 29 18:19:52 <mercenary>	Probably depends on how much you are willing to pay
Feb 29 18:20:00 <Cowclops>	speaking of deadpool and IT
Feb 29 18:20:00 <scottpedia>	tomman: they don't purchase APs as in bulk amounts from a single vendor?
Feb 29 18:20:05 <Cowclops>	my friend actually for real owned deadpool.com in 1997
Feb 29 18:20:12 <tomman>	scottpedia: welcome to Venezuela
Feb 29 18:20:14 <Cowclops>	he sold it to some rando for like $100 after a few months
Feb 29 18:20:23 <Cowclops>	"Not marvel, fox, or disney" lol
Feb 29 18:20:38 <Cowclops>	deadpool.com redirects to the fox web site now
Feb 29 18:20:39 <tomman>	they just walk into the nearest Honest Abdul's Cheap Fridges And Computerizers and beg for credit
Feb 29 18:20:44 <scottpedia>	tomman: that sounds like getting everything from retail
Feb 29 18:20:52 <Cowclops>	or "20th century studios" since, its not fox.
Feb 29 18:20:53 <tomman>	you're a smart dude~
Feb 29 18:21:01 <scottpedia>	Cowclops: that's great
Feb 29 18:21:23 <scottpedia>	i mean perhaps the rando was working with fox Cowclops 
Feb 29 18:21:34 <Cowclops>	With a relatively new and unknown character
Feb 29 18:21:43 <Cowclops>	its not just that the web wasn't as big in 97 as it is now, also deadpool barely existed
Feb 29 18:22:13 <Cowclops>	its not like going on and buying superman.com in 97
Feb 29 18:22:37 <Cowclops>	mikerowesoft.com lol
Feb 29 18:23:49 <minimal>	my own ISP in the early 90s used gpl.com and gpl.net (as that was the company name)
Feb 29 18:24:33 <scottpedia>	ok minimal 
Feb 29 18:24:39 <scottpedia>	what's special about gpl.com?
Feb 29 18:24:55 <minimal>	the GPL software license?
Feb 29 18:25:49 <minimal>	we also used thegap.com for customers' email.......until GAP (who used gap.com at then) put their attack-dog lawyers on us
Feb 29 18:26:43 <scottpedia>	minimal: wait. they got you on litigations over the use of a domain?
Feb 29 18:26:58 <minimal>	this was before the whole "phenomena" of big companies threatening others to get domain names they felt entitled to
Feb 29 18:27:25 <scottpedia>	i never thought that was a thing though
Feb 29 18:28:19 <minimal>	scottpedia: basically we received a fax from a large USA legal firm saying "hand over thegap.com to our clients, GAP, or we'll sue you into the ground"
Feb 29 18:28:24 <Blondie101010>	trademark control is not a matter of technology
Feb 29 18:28:40 <scottpedia>	i don't think gpl.com redirects to fsf.org or gnu.org right?
Feb 29 18:28:53 <Blondie101010>	that was not the point
Feb 29 18:29:21 <scottpedia>	minimal: they litereally said that?
Feb 29 18:29:48 <Blondie101010>	no, he explained that it was a trademark problem
Feb 29 18:29:50 <minimal>	well legalise to that effect and they wanted it to happen immediately
Feb 29 18:30:55 <scottpedia>	i don't think they can win the case though
Feb 29 18:31:07 <scottpedia>	how do they state their reasonings at court
Feb 29 18:31:26 <minimal>	doesn't matter whether they can win or not if you're a small company without the funds to be dragged through the courts
Feb 29 18:31:56 <Blondie101010>	yeah, that's how most trademark issues are resolved (outside court)
Feb 29 18:32:38 <scottpedia>	ok
Feb 29 18:33:23 <Blondie101010>	and if it gets to court, it will vastly depend on the judge's IT skill and knowledge
Feb 29 18:34:12 <minimal>	I left the company a few months later so not 100% what happened but it seems the company migrated customers over to a different domain and then let the domain registration lapse but GAP never then registered it - I know this as I noticed that several years later GAP's lawyers then used the DNS "takeover" process to again try and get the domain from the then domain holders
Feb 29 18:34:18 <scottpedia>	Blondie101010: i don't think a lot of the judges today are in any way proficient in IT
Feb 29 18:34:33 <Cowclops>	People don't realize how hard it is to enforce trademark
Feb 29 18:34:54 <Blondie101010>	well trying to enforce it protects it a lot more than doing nothing
Feb 29 18:35:01 <Blondie101010>	if you do nothing, you lose all rights
Feb 29 18:35:06 <Cowclops>	The classic example from my business law class (not law school but nonetheless business school) was that victoria's secret was unable to sue a lingerie company called victoria's secret closet 
Feb 29 18:35:17 <scottpedia>	even if they are they must have received their education from the big corps who have written the material to their needs Blondie101010 
Feb 29 18:35:34 <Cowclops>	The reason they lost is because the company with a similar name was too small to have any chance of being confused with the big one
Feb 29 18:35:53 <Blondie101010>	not a great reason
Feb 29 18:35:56 <Cowclops>	Just being a small operation literally gets you out of being sued for trademark (i mean, tehy can sue you, just unsuccesfully)
Feb 29 18:36:03 <Blondie101010>	it was clearly misintended
Feb 29 18:36:04 <Cowclops>	There needs to be brand confusion for it to be a problem
Feb 29 18:36:09 <Cowclops>	Pepsi can't rename themselves Coca Cola
Feb 29 18:36:44 <Cowclops>	i mean, legally what i'm saying is there can't just be a similar name and a similar business, it also has to likely cause market confusion, which a small business would not. Even if it was intended to.
Feb 29 18:37:09 <minimal>	what I found "funny" was in the documents GAP's (then) lawyers submitted to the Domain arbitration panel they stated that to the best of their knowledge the domain had been registered by that "org" in 1993.......which was obviously untrue as my old company registered it in 1993.....so whatever happened to "corporate memory"? As GAP's lawyers in 1997 had threatened to sue my company for the domain then how could GAP's layers several years later 
Feb 29 18:37:09 <minimal>	"truthfully" make a statement that the other company had registered the domain in 1993?
Feb 29 18:37:11 <Blondie101010>	what makes it more complicated is that DNS is not regional
Feb 29 18:38:04 <Blondie101010>	minimal:  they didn't know how to check
Feb 29 18:38:09 <Cowclops>	So nissan can't sue nissan uzi about nissan.com because he's not a car company and its just his actual name 
Feb 29 18:38:13 <Blondie101010>	probably hard to find
Feb 29 18:38:15 <Cowclops>	or uzi nissan, whatever
Feb 29 18:38:21 <Cowclops>	Like they tried, but unsuccesfully.
Feb 29 18:38:25 <scottpedia>	Cowclops: that's interesting
Feb 29 18:38:55 <Cowclops>	You have to show why there would not be confusion. Not being in the same market would work. Showing that a small time ope ration won't be confused with a large one would work. Being even just a little dfiferent would work.
Feb 29 18:39:01 <Cowclops>	You just can't completley copy-pasta somebody's logo
Feb 29 18:39:07 <Cowclops>	and business. and, instantaneously, size
Feb 29 18:39:17 <minimal>	Blondie101010: my point being that GAP should know and so if they lawyer make such an "incorrect" statement of fact on GAP's behalf then isn't there some legal "peril" in doing so?
Feb 29 18:39:43 <Blondie101010>	I agree, but they obviously weren't ethical/honest or did a bad job
Feb 29 18:40:20 <Blondie101010>	it's hard for the defense to prove it 
Feb 29 18:52:09 <node1>	Hi anyone using github for ci/cd pipeline?
Feb 29 19:05:12 <Blondie101010>	node1: it is always ridiculous to do this type of poll/question
Feb 29 19:05:37 <Blondie101010>	if you think the answer is no, then you should go read or hire someone qualified
Feb 29 19:06:05 <Blondie101010>	and if you expect it to be yes, then just ask the real question
Feb 29 19:09:30 <javi404>	i have to do GDPR training, I found 34 courses in the system. lol
Feb 29 19:09:55 <javi404>	nshire: the answer is pretty much everyone is using github
Feb 29 19:10:17 <javi404>	i meant node1 who seems to be gone now.
Feb 29 19:10:25 <javi404>	is it homework question time?
Feb 29 19:13:24 <Blondie101010>	ahh he did leave :/
Feb 29 19:13:55 <Blondie101010>	not sure I saw him ever ask an educated question
Feb 29 19:14:30 <Blondie101010>	s/educated/informed/
Feb 29 19:19:08 <javi404>	IDK, looks like it. I just know over the years people come in here asking homework questions.
Feb 29 19:22:07 <catphish>	node1: no, nobody uses that, github are very upset that they built such a useful platform and not a single person uses it
Feb 29 19:23:31 <catphish>	(he didnt stick arund long enough for any kind of answer)
Feb 29 19:34:05 <Harm133>	Hey guys
Feb 29 19:34:30 <Harm133>	I was in here yesterday with questions about 10Gbit networking and performance issues
Feb 29 19:34:52 <Harm133>	I did iperf tests on all the hosts, which came to a nice 9.9Gbit/s but did application testing today and don't understand the differences
Feb 29 19:35:35 <Harm133>	I have 3 boxes, 1 is the server, 2 are clients. If I send traffic from the server to client one I get about 5.5Gbit/s but if I send it to client two I get about 8.7Gbit/s
Feb 29 19:35:57 <Harm133>	the CPU is almost not used on either client (one has dual xeon, the other dual epycs)
Feb 29 19:36:15 <Harm133>	So I'm wondering where the difference in performance might originate?
Feb 29 19:36:32 <Harm133>	All 3 boxes are almalinux9
Feb 29 19:40:57 <koollman>	Harm133: which application is it, and how its networking is different from a basic tcp bandwidth tool like iperf ?
Feb 29 19:41:21 <Harm133>	its a inhouse testing tool to mimmic our production applications data
Feb 29 19:41:23 <koollman>	which one is the xeon ? fast one ?
Feb 29 19:41:45 <Harm133>	its a relatively fast one, but the xeon one is the faster one :)
Feb 29 19:41:54 <Harm133>	the epycs are way newer and WAY faster
Feb 29 19:42:17 <Harm133>	(the testing tool sends actual data, not junk)
Feb 29 19:42:48 <Harm133>	All boxes are on the same switch, all copper
Feb 29 19:43:21 <Harm133>	only difference is the Xeon has a X550 NIC and the Epyc a X710 (as for the networking part)
Feb 29 19:52:52 <catphish>	Harm133: if iperf can get 9.9Gbps on the same link then clearly the problem is the application
Feb 29 19:53:54 <Harm133>	I understand that, but I don't understand the big difference between the two clients
Feb 29 19:58:51 <catphish>	there's no way we can really guess without knowing how the server generates and sends the data, or how the clients receive or process it
Feb 29 20:00:05 <Harm133>	for simplicity's sake I `nc -lk 9999 > /dev/null` for now on the clients
Feb 29 20:00:13 <Harm133>	cant really share the server code tho :(
Feb 29 20:02:45 <catphish>	well if that runs slower than iperf3 then the server side is likely the problem
Feb 29 20:03:10 <Harm133>	I also saw the same behaviour with a simpler test, opening a socket with python and piping a lot of traffic into there
Feb 29 20:03:38 <Harm133>	catphish how so? The clients are showing differing behaviour, I don't understand how the server would be the cause?
Feb 29 20:04:09 <catphish>	to be clear though, iperf3 gives the full 10G speed to both clients?
Feb 29 20:04:55 <Harm133>	by my recollection, yes
Feb 29 20:04:59 <catphish>	if so, clearly the hardware isn't the problem, and the OS isn't the problem, and since you swapped out the receiver with nc, it's reeasonable to assume that's not the problem either
Feb 29 20:05:08 <catphish>	that only leaves the server, right?
Feb 29 20:06:52 <Harm133>	well, yesterday I was playing around with the rx ring buffer size on the slower client
Feb 29 20:07:03 <Harm133>	increasing it from 256 to 4k improved performance by 15%~
Feb 29 20:07:18 <Harm133>	so that would point ot the client side again
Feb 29 20:08:15 <catphish>	i think you need to do a simpler test with a single plain tcp socket at each end sending dummy data as fast as possible
Feb 29 20:08:26 <catphish>	(which is what iperf3 does)
Feb 29 20:08:59 <Harm133>	I'll re-check, but pretty sure that we've covered those tests
Feb 29 20:09:10 <Harm133>	can't test now however
Feb 29 20:37:58 <javi404>	haha, i posted something about an aws workspaces outage that happened last night in #aws, no one responded.
Feb 29 20:38:09 <javi404>	some shitshow going on there.
Feb 29 20:38:22 <uwu>	need more layoffs
Feb 29 20:38:34 <uwu>	then bezos buy more bitcoin
Feb 29 20:38:52 <javi404>	at least they sent an email saying it's their fault and my team can be clear. 
Feb 29 20:39:02 <javi404>	we didn't fuck anything up, they did.
Feb 29 20:40:21 <javi404>	what ever came from the ATT outage? is there a RCA available?
Feb 29 20:41:00 <Ximo>	aws workspaces pricing doesn't seem that disgusting, but i assume that's because they're fighting for screenconnect's scraps
Feb 29 20:41:21 <javi404>	and vmware / horizon vdi

Mar 01 02:17:32 <nshire>	my friend just got his internet set up and it seems like he might have ipv6 only.. is there any chance of him being able to connect to my ipv4 services?
Mar 01 02:19:25 <Whiskey`>	no way he is v6 only
Mar 01 02:20:59 <JakLareo>	nshire: yeah, highly doubt he has no ipv4 connectivity at all, way too much of the internet would break. Even if his device only gets an IPv6 address, he almost certainly has something like 464XLAT or NAT64 + DNS64 to allow him to reach IPv4 services
Mar 01 02:21:38 <Whiskey`>	yea but ive never heard of a end user isp doing that en mass
Mar 01 02:21:56 <Whiskey`>	it would be lovely if they were but no i doubt it
Mar 01 02:22:08 <Whiskey`>	nshire: have him go to whatsmyip.org or some such
Mar 01 02:22:50 <nshire>	yeah not sure what his exact situation is. 
Mar 01 02:23:25 <nshire>	maybe cgnat is screwing with his connection, not sure though. is there an easy way for someone who doesn't know anything about computers to check whether they are behind CGNAT?
Mar 01 02:24:55 <nshire>	next time he's online I'll see if he can reach my webserver, that should answer some questions
Mar 01 02:38:42 <rustyaxe>	tmobile will give you ip6 only if you misconfigure things
Mar 01 02:40:26 <nshire>	my verizon mobile was doing that for a while. made it impossible to use the hotspot for gaming
Mar 01 04:25:07 <Whiskey`>	rustyaxe: well sure any connection could
Mar 01 04:25:16 <Whiskey`>	nshire: yes have them run winmtr
Mar 01 04:25:19 <Whiskey`>	or a traceroute
Mar 01 04:25:30 <Whiskey`>	if they see a 100.64 ip at all, its cgnat
Mar 01 04:25:31 <nshire>	not sure if he even has a pc
Mar 01 04:25:52 <nshire>	console people...
Mar 01 04:26:39 <Whiskey`>	100.64 to 100.127, eh consoles
Mar 01 04:26:42 <Whiskey`>	surely he has a phone
Mar 01 04:29:35 <Blondie101010>	but frankly, at some point you need to have a minimum of functional tools and skills to do anything
Mar 01 04:29:59 <Blondie101010>	I'd advise them to ask a friend to come over with their laptop
Mar 01 07:43:36 <marcopolo1>	Could a router that has an ip and is connected to its own subnet not be able to connect to the internet even if that router is connected to another network connected to the internet?
Mar 01 07:45:26 <mlu>	marcopolo1: absolutely
Mar 01 07:45:37 <mlu>	marcopolo1: sometimes, it may even be intentional
Mar 01 07:45:50 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: "connect to the internet" is a strange phrasing, honestly.
Mar 01 07:46:35 <dminuoso>	But yeah, you may either lack routability into the internet, or a firewall on the way may forbid it.
Mar 01 07:47:23 <mlu>	and define "connect" -- does it count if you can only send packets one way?
Mar 01 07:48:47 <marcopolo1>	How do you forbid a router on a firewall? Every router uses different ports or?
Mar 01 07:49:08 <marcopolo1>	mlu: yes
Mar 01 07:49:09 <dminuoso>	You dont forbid routers, you forbid flows
Mar 01 07:49:30 <mlu>	this -^
Mar 01 07:49:34 <dminuoso>	All told, a firewall is just a bunch of rules that say "From that IP, with that source port, to that IP to that source port [DENY/ALLOW]"
Mar 01 07:49:55 <mlu>	most of the firewalls I deal with are configured as "deny everything except..."
Mar 01 07:50:53 <dminuoso>	That being said, you can conceptually forbid a router and everything behind it through various means on a firewall.
Mar 01 07:51:00 <dminuoso>	Which is a thing, really.
Mar 01 07:51:07 <marcopolo1>	So if theres no firewall the router just automatically inherits eveything from the networks above it?
Mar 01 07:51:20 <dminuoso>	Not necessarily either, no.
Mar 01 07:51:29 <mlu>	marcopolo1: you have to enable the routing
Mar 01 07:51:29 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: Routability is the other part.
Mar 01 07:51:57 <dminuoso>	And by routability I mean that, in both directions, there is routes along the entire path for your desired connection.
Mar 01 07:52:18 <dminuoso>	From your perspective, your router (and the router behind it) need either a default route (or be in the DFZ)
Mar 01 07:52:34 <dminuoso>	And equivalently your router (and all the routers behind it), need a route for your hosts IP.
Mar 01 07:52:47 <dminuoso>	If one of those routes is missing, there is no internet access either. 
Mar 01 07:53:43 <marcopolo1>	By route you mean a gateway ?
Mar 01 07:53:51 <dminuoso>	No, by route I mean route.
Mar 01 07:53:55 <Whiskey`>	a gateway is a router
Mar 01 07:54:22 <Whiskey`>	a route is a set of information, a rule, on what said router should do with packets that match
Mar 01 07:54:23 <dminuoso>	A route is a specification tyat says "To reach a.b.c.d/x, the next hop is e.f.g.h at interface eno1"
Mar 01 07:54:42 <dminuoso>	That route is called a default route if `a.b.c.d/x` is 0.0.0.0/0
Mar 01 07:55:16 <marcopolo1>	Can a router have multiple different routes?
Mar 01 07:55:18 <dminuoso>	Yes.
Mar 01 07:55:35 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: In fact, by its very definition, a router necessarily always has two routes at minimum.
Mar 01 07:55:53 <dminuoso>	Because a router connects multiple networks, so at minimum it will have a route for each of those networks it is connected to
Mar 01 07:56:02 <dminuoso>	If not, it wouldnt be able to do any routing.
Mar 01 07:56:05 <Cowclops>	Sidenote: One time I was given a static IP to use on my router by spectrum that had working routes to other spectrum IPs, but not "the internet"
Mar 01 07:56:25 <Cowclops>	I didn't even notice right away because it was temporaroy internet for a store trailer and I was able to set up a VPN between it and our main office
Mar 01 07:56:32 <Cowclops>	w/ ipsec
Mar 01 07:57:08 <Cowclops>	then, while connected via openvpn to our main office which i had to do to set up the ipsec tunnel (pullin myself up by my own boot straps), "the internet worked" so i thought nothing else of it
Mar 01 07:57:17 <Cowclops>	get a call a couple days later "internet doesn't work at the new temp site"
Mar 01 07:57:28 <Cowclops>	::literally responds to ping::
Mar 01 07:57:30 <dminuoso>	Routing without routability to the internet isn't common in most household scenarios.
Mar 01 07:58:11 <Cowclops>	They actually assigned me an IP that belonged to a different geographic region and didn't have the right routes from that to the internet at large
Mar 01 07:58:17 <Cowclops>	and hads to give me another one
Mar 01 07:58:22 <Cowclops>	They fucked up so bad I think the second one didn't work EITHER
Mar 01 07:58:32 <Cowclops>	third times the charm
Mar 01 07:58:39 <dminuoso>	One example we have at work, is a particular L3 service for a bigger company. That bigger company has suppliers, and to enable access to their internal networks, we provide routers to those customers. We then facilitate routing between those suppliers and that company.
Mar 01 07:58:43 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: ^-
Mar 01 07:59:18 <dminuoso>	This is something where in smaller and simpler cases the company might provide a VPN - but that requires exposing that stack over the internet.
Mar 01 07:59:49 <dminuoso>	Which is why something like this only happens for larger shops where the cost of that separate infrastructure is considered worth to combat the security risks of exposing a VPN in the internet.
Mar 01 08:00:09 <Cowclops>	So like my pfsense router knows what the next hop is because you set an upstream gateway IP. But thats the most boring version of routing (just taking a singular upstream gateway and doing nat from lan IPs to wan IPs and the nsending it to the next hop which is on the same subnet but knowing nothing else about how the internet is wired)
Mar 01 08:01:20 <marcopolo1>	Okay
Mar 01 08:01:29 <marcopolo1>	Thanks
Mar 01 08:01:40 <Cowclops>	then, the ISP's upstream gateway is whats doing the fun stuff of keeping track of networks via BGP and sending traffic where it actually needs to go, because anything up the line is always going to have multiple paths
Mar 01 08:02:00 <mlu>	edge routers can have 100000's of routes
Mar 01 08:02:03 <Cowclops>	I deal with spanning tree for layer 2 networks and redundant paths, but the internet is doing it at layer 3 with routing, not just shutting links off to avoid loops
Mar 01 08:02:04 <Cowclops>	Yep
Mar 01 08:02:16 <mlu>	thankfully, route aggregation is a thing
Mar 01 08:02:17 <Cowclops>	Like it has to download and store a massive table
Mar 01 08:02:32 <marcopolo1>	Can you think of routes like $Path ?
Mar 01 08:02:36 <mlu>	current edge BGP table requires 6GB of RAM
Mar 01 08:02:51 <Cowclops>	basically "what interface should i send it out based on which network its going to"
Mar 01 08:03:00 <Cowclops>	"i'm sending it to an AWS datacenter in virginia"
Mar 01 08:03:04 <Cowclops>	"ok you should send it out this interface
Mar 01 08:03:09 <mlu>	marcopolo1: imagine you're at an intersection and you're trying to figure out which way to go to get somewhere
Mar 01 08:03:17 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: No, not a $path actually!
Mar 01 08:03:23 <mlu>	marcopolo1: the router reads the IP address and figures out which path to send you on (i.e. what's the next hop)
Mar 01 08:03:33 <Cowclops>	but its like a 16 way intersection and there are 6GB of data to let you know which way each path goes to
Mar 01 08:03:37 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: But your thought was good, and there exist other notions than routes that more closely resemble paths.
Mar 01 08:03:47 <dminuoso>	mlu: A route is really just a "next hop" bit of that path.
Mar 01 08:03:58 <dminuoso>	So if you think of a path of a set of sections, then a route is a singular section of that path.
Mar 01 08:04:02 <mlu>	yep
Mar 01 08:04:17 <mlu>	ie. I have a few subnets within my intranet (think: three LANs)
Mar 01 08:04:37 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: as a consequence, no single router knows about the path of the connection - and the path back might be different too.
Mar 01 08:04:38 <mlu>	when a router sees a packet, it will read the destination IP address and decide where to send it
Mar 01 08:04:53 <mlu>	and if it doesn't match my three LANs and is a valid IP address, it goes to the default route (i.e. up to the itnernet)
Mar 01 08:05:01 <Cowclops>	BGP, OSPF, and the like (not completely interchangeable but work on the same premise of "deciding what route a packet should take") are dynamic so you a router gets a table that says "if your destination is this address, your next hop is this router"
Mar 01 08:05:16 <Cowclops>	But you can make a much simpler example at home with static routing tables
Mar 01 08:05:39 <marcopolo1>	So it looks into its dns and if it doesnt find anything it sends it to the next router until one knows something ?
Mar 01 08:05:47 <mlu>	marcopolo1: not exactly
Mar 01 08:05:52 <Cowclops>	The routing table is really what tells it where to go, how the routing table gets populated is what makes for the difference between bgp, ospf, and just static routes
Mar 01 08:06:03 <mlu>	marcopolo1: tehre's literally a table -- it matches the most specific route
Mar 01 08:06:05 <Cowclops>	Nah, DNS just turns it into the address
Mar 01 08:06:30 <Cowclops>	But lots of companies own lots of IP network blocks, so to know where data needs to go on the PUBLIC INTERNET is massive
Mar 01 08:06:32 <mlu>	marcopolo1: i.e. on a typical LAN router, you'd have something like 192.168.1.0/24 routes to the LAN, 0.0.0.0/0 goes upstream (to the internet)
Mar 01 08:06:49 <Cowclops>	On the flip side you could setup OSFP "inside" a corporate network, so that if you fire up a new router with new subnets it can let the other routers know how to get to it
Mar 01 08:07:05 <Cowclops>	...or just type 'em in randomly if its not complex enough to e ven require that
Mar 01 08:07:18 <jacekowski>	i'm running ospf at home 
Mar 01 08:07:24 <jacekowski>	and i only have about 20 routes to deal with
Mar 01 08:07:27 <mlu>	and in my situation (network addresses changed for privacy): I'd have: 192.168.1.0/24 goes to my trusted LAN, 192.168.2.0/24 goes to my testnet, 10.10.0.0/16 goes to my VPN tunnel, 0.0.0.0/0 goes to my ISP
Mar 01 08:07:53 <Cowclops>	Yeah i mean, we're nerds on #networking on IRC, if you have 20 routes your setup is already more complicated than most people's home internet, lol
Mar 01 08:08:13 <mlu>	BGP between different AWS regions
Mar 01 08:08:20 <jacekowski>	Cowclops: citation needed
Mar 01 08:08:34 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: the lookup rules are relatively simple: inside your routing table you just look for the "best matching route", whatever that may be. I intentionally skip some of the details of "best matching" because thats of little interest to get the gist.
Mar 01 08:08:35 <mlu>	or having an easy "tap" into my company's intranet (we're a startup)
Mar 01 08:08:57 <Cowclops>	::checks channel name:: yep. ::checks irc client:: yep. ::checks 100 random people's home internet:: just one default gateway which is the ISP's next hop
Mar 01 08:08:58 <Cowclops>	MATH CHECKS OUT
Mar 01 08:09:00 <mlu>	and oh, some routes may be blackholed -- i.e. I know I don't use 172.16.0.0/12 -- so I blackhole those
Mar 01 08:09:13 <mlu>	router sees a packet going there, matches the blackhole route, just discards it :)
Mar 01 08:09:16 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: "a default route" (one for 0.0.0.0/0) is generally considered "least matching", and its in that sense that it is a "default route", because it acts as a catch all networks you do not have better/more specific routes for.
Mar 01 08:09:33 <marcopolo1>	So if 192.168.1.0/24 sends a request to google, it routes it to 0.0.0.0/0?
Mar 01 08:09:46 <mlu>	if I was designing a private, airgapped network, the default route might even be a blackhole
Mar 01 08:09:54 <Cowclops>	now lets say you have 3 routers at home, and not "consumer internet wifi gateways" because they generally onyl have one wan connection and one lan connection, not enough unique interfaces to even make a logical example
Mar 01 08:09:57 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: No!
Mar 01 08:09:58 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: 0.0.0.0/0 is not a specification for "via", but a "for that network"
Mar 01 08:10:00 <mlu>	marcopolo1: well, it dpeends on what is google :)
Mar 01 08:10:04 <dminuoso>	so 0.0.0.0/0 means "everything"
Mar 01 08:10:10 <grawity>	if you meant "using the 0.0.0.0/0 route" then yeah
Mar 01 08:10:10 <jacekowski>	only 3 routers?
Mar 01 08:10:21 <grawity>	assuming there's nothing more-specific in there that'd match 'google'
Mar 01 08:10:24 <mlu>	marcopolo1: say I wanted to send a packet to 8.8.8.8 -- sure, it doesn't match the rest of my routes, so it goes to 0.0.0.0/0, which happens to have a route to google
Mar 01 08:10:33 <Cowclops>	Its more like, because 192.168.1.0/24 is a subnet of 0.0.0.0/0, it will use the specificed uplink address which might be... 12.34.56.78 in your case 
Mar 01 08:10:45 <Cowclops>	your routing table would say "If its going to 0.0.0.0/0 then send traffic to 12.34.56.78"
Mar 01 08:10:48 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: so a default route might be `route 0.0.0.0/0 via 192.0.0.1, interface en0`
Mar 01 08:10:52 <Cowclops>	Where's it going to and whats the next hop
Mar 01 08:10:56 <Cowclops>	It only needs to know the next hop
Mar 01 08:11:01 <Cowclops>	It doesn't need to know every hop along the way
Mar 01 08:11:16 <dminuoso>	mlu: So that rule really says "any IP *can* be routed to 192.0.0.01" (which hopefully can route the packet further)
Mar 01 08:11:18 <mlu>	marcopolo1: at your ISP, their routers might have more itnersting routing tables (i.e. 53.0.0.0/0 goes to AWS, 8.0.0.0/8 goes to Google, etc.)
Mar 01 08:11:21 <grawity>	marcopolo1: have you ever taken a look at an actual routing table?
Mar 01 08:11:21 <dminuoso>	whether that router actually can, you dont know.
Mar 01 08:11:36 <mlu>	and exactly how those routes get figured out -- that's what BGP is for
Mar 01 08:11:40 <Cowclops>	if you're on windows
Mar 01 08:11:44 <Cowclops>	just open up a command prompt and type route print
Mar 01 08:11:58 <scottpedia>	marcopolo1: bro
Mar 01 08:12:07 <scottpedia>	the packets will be forwarded to the next router
Mar 01 08:12:17 *	mlu hops around
Mar 01 08:12:23 <scottpedia>	and /24 is a range not an address
Mar 01 08:12:48 <scottpedia>	packets can never be from 192.168.1.0/24
Mar 01 08:12:57 <mlu>	and furthermore, in more advanced configurations, you can do fancy stuff like ECMP (equal cost multi path), where alternating packets to the same destinations go to different routers
Mar 01 08:13:30 <mlu>	which can work beacuse they both have (different) routes to the same destination(s)
Mar 01 08:14:00 <mlu>	but yeah, a router's basic job is: inspect the destination IP address, figure out which route it goes to, send it down that route
Mar 01 08:14:31 <Cowclops>	Oh its more interesting now because my hypothesis was right, but we had this crazy issue where the datacenter for our third party managed document filing software server was responding in like 90ms 
Mar 01 08:14:33 <dminuoso>	And importantly: in "normal routing" no single router has knowledge of the entire path.
Mar 01 08:14:41 <scottpedia>	mlu: yes. sometimes the routes are static. but also there are routing protocols
Mar 01 08:14:42 <dminuoso>	So each router is *only* concerned with the next hop.
Mar 01 08:14:45 <Cowclops>	but on a tracert, other IPs in their  datacenter before you got there was like 9ms
Mar 01 08:15:04 <dminuoso>	Though via BGP there is a sense of "regional awareness" if you want.
Mar 01 08:15:04 <scottpedia>	i don't remember the name of that dynamic routing protocol...
Mar 01 08:15:07 <Cowclops>	and if you tracert'd it from different source IPs, like from other places, you'd get 9ms to our server's ipsec endpoint
Mar 01 08:15:21 <Cowclops>	So you'd get 90ms or 9ms depending on where it came from
Mar 01 08:15:32 <Cowclops>	Bad route. But it took a lot of cage rattling to get the right people to fix
Mar 01 08:15:48 <Cowclops>	Because our app provider was just like "shrug it works for us, fix your internet"
Mar 01 08:15:54 <scottpedia>	they have distance/time-based weight system set up and everything
Mar 01 08:16:12 <Cowclops>	And when we're like "but its not our internet, look at the trace route" they were like  "well, we'll ask the datacenter" and the datacenter would come back and say "try resetting your cable modem" or whatever stupid
Mar 01 08:16:13 <grawity>	Babel?
Mar 01 08:16:15 <Cowclops>	Basically "not our problem'
Mar 01 08:16:34 <grawity>	apparently original ARPANET routing used a dynamic latency-based protocol
Mar 01 08:16:39 <Cowclops>	turns out it was their problem but explaining an issue with routing to entry level helpdesk folk doesn't fucking work
Mar 01 08:16:41 <mlu>	Cowclops: reminds me of the time an entire team in my company used Slack to ask if the internet was down
Mar 01 08:16:46 <grawity>	I thought it was all static from the NOC but apparently not
Mar 01 08:16:54 <mlu>	and then they convinced each other that it was
Mar 01 08:16:56 <Cowclops>	And sometimes you have to be like "put me on the phone with somebody who understands the question plxo"
Mar 01 08:16:56 <mlu>	and messaged me to debug
Mar 01 08:16:59 <dminuoso>	Haha. :-)
Mar 01 08:16:59 <Cowclops>	plz"
Mar 01 08:17:04 <mlu>	to which I was like: wtf, no, but github is down
Mar 01 08:17:15 <dminuoso>	mlu: Relatedly, we use Slack precisely because its maintained outside of all our infrastructure.
Mar 01 08:17:34 <Cowclops>	"The wifi is down" ::wap works, internet works, they're just trying to access a site that isn't whitelisted::
Mar 01 08:17:35 <dminuoso>	So no matter what kind of networking fire we have, communication via mobiles is still possible.
Mar 01 08:17:45 <mlu>	hehe, status pages :)
Mar 01 08:17:54 <Cowclops>	Dminuoso: Memba that time less than a week ago AT&T was out for half a day
Mar 01 08:17:56 <mlu>	gotta have a disaster recovery plan
Mar 01 08:18:03 <Cowclops>	our company has AT&T cell service
Mar 01 08:18:22 <Cowclops>	But obviously teams still worked over wifi 
Mar 01 08:18:42 <Cowclops>	technically, wifi calling was fine too. It was the cell network and not like, the phone service that was down
Mar 01 08:18:49 <grawity>	what happens if your network goes poof and *you're* the mobile operator for your cellphone
Mar 01 08:19:15 <Cowclops>	like, "you work for at&t?"
Mar 01 08:19:17 <mlu>	proper disaster planning means you think these through and have a plan
Mar 01 08:19:38 <mlu>	ie.. if slack is down, email or call these people, if these people are unreachable, etc.
Mar 01 08:19:46 <mlu>	if you are on call and all else fails, show up at the office
Mar 01 08:19:51 <grawity>	right but what kind of plan would that involve? if your wifi is down *and* your cell network is down
Mar 01 08:20:00 <grawity>	which I assume shouldn't occur at the same time generally,
Mar 01 08:20:08 <Cowclops>	i glossed over it but reiterating because its interesting: its so difficult to get complicated problems solved when entry level helpdesk can't be convinced that the problem is over their pay grade
Mar 01 08:20:11 <grawity>	but then I remember how facebook managed to lock themselves out of the building via BGP
Mar 01 08:20:21 <mlu>	"... if your company got nuked and everyone died, here's the succession plan and reosurces to help you find a new job"
Mar 01 08:20:46 <Cowclops>	Had a similar issue when my brother was getting new internet service and i tested the line by plugging it into my laptop and puinching in the static IPs. It worked, but then you plug it into the pfsense router (a netgate device, not a DIY thing) and it didn't
Mar 01 08:20:50 <mercenary>	grawity: that's why you keep a stash of string, and some tin cans
Mar 01 08:20:52 <Cowclops>	"Must be something wrong with your router then"
Mar 01 08:21:13 <Cowclops>	Nope. Laptop was incorrectly ignoring a bad vlan tag, and router was correctly dropping traffic for traffic that shouldn't have been tagged
Mar 01 08:21:20 <Cowclops>	They fixed it.
Mar 01 08:21:42 <Cowclops>	Network engineering/configuration issue. Not a "somebody tripped over the cable and broke it" issue
Mar 01 08:22:24 <Cowclops>	Incorrectly ignoring might be the wrong way to put it, but my laptop was expecting edge-port access and therefore didn't care what vlans were. You absolutely can enable vlan support on the intel nic in my laptop
Mar 01 08:22:45 <grawity>	it's annoying that you have to explicitly enable it though
Mar 01 08:22:53 <Cowclops>	The router is vlan aware by default, and therefore was ignoring tagged traffic on an interface where it only expected untagged
Mar 01 08:22:58 <grawity>	is that the MonitorMode registry hack or something else?
Mar 01 08:23:08 <Cowclops>	On  intel stuff its just in the control panel for iit
Mar 01 08:23:39 <grawity>	picking up tagged RAs as if they were untagged is the most annoying thing Wndows does
Mar 01 08:23:46 <scottpedia>	intel is supreme
Mar 01 08:23:58 <scottpedia>	i do not recognize arm
Mar 01 08:24:42 <scottpedia>	for even the lowest microcontroller i have to use Intel x86
Mar 01 08:24:50 *	grawity puts scottpedia on the itanic
Mar 01 08:28:20 <mlu>	scottpedia: what about RISCV or PPC?
Mar 01 08:28:41 <scottpedia>	mlu: i don't know what that is
Mar 01 08:29:17 <dminuoso>	Intel is supreme at building race conditions and inflating benchmarks to boost sales, yeah.
Mar 01 08:30:13 <dminuoso>	They definitely are good at marketing. Nobody ever got fired for buying Intel chips.
Mar 01 08:30:32 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: idc i would have wished that my heart be made by intel
Mar 01 08:31:31 <mlu>	scottpedia: what about 8051, m68k, and z80?
Mar 01 08:31:48 <marcopolo1>	If we have optic fiber cables connected to mars we could communicate instanly?
Mar 01 08:31:57 <scottpedia>	mlu: no idea  what that is
Mar 01 08:32:01 <mlu>	marcopolo1: no, that's physically impossible
Mar 01 08:32:06 <trafficjam>	should using `https://127.0.0.1.sslip.oi` have a long response time for local services?
Mar 01 08:32:10 <mlu>	scottpedia: how old are you?
Mar 01 08:32:10 <scottpedia>	marcopolo1: not instantly. ther's gotta be some latency
Mar 01 08:32:13 <mercenary>	scottpedia: you'd have speculative heartbeat vulnerabilities
Mar 01 08:32:35 <scottpedia>	mlu: early 20s
Mar 01 08:32:42 <mlu>	marcopolo1: not to mention, how would you even physically do fiber optic cables connected to Mars?
Mar 01 08:32:50 <mlu>	scottpedia: ah, old enough to have experienced Gameboy?
Mar 01 08:33:10 <mlu>	scottpedia: and did you ever have a graphing calculator?
Mar 01 08:33:23 <scottpedia>	mlu: yes. as a child i did
Mar 01 08:33:41 <mlu>	the TI-83+/TI-84 and Gameboy are Z80
Mar 01 08:33:44 <scottpedia>	i did use an SAT calculater which was made by TI mlu 
Mar 01 08:33:56 <marcopolo1>	You cant attach cables to something spinning and moving
Mar 01 08:33:57 <mlu>	the TI-89/TI-92 was m68k
Mar 01 08:34:18 <mlu>	marcopolo1: and it'd probably get tangled up in the sun if you did magically have one that was long enough
Mar 01 08:34:18 <scottpedia>	marcopolo1: that's impossible i think
Mar 01 08:34:23 <dminuoso>	08:32:42          +mlu │ marcopolo1: not to mention, how would you even physically do fiber optic cables connected to Mars?
Mar 01 08:34:33 <dminuoso>	Same way you do any fiber optics.
Mar 01 08:34:38 <dminuoso>	Call the infrastructure team and make it their problem.
Mar 01 08:34:45 <marcopolo1>	Lol
Mar 01 08:34:52 <scottpedia>	it would be eaten by the sun if earth and mars are in opposite directions 
Mar 01 08:34:56 <scottpedia>	marcopolo1: 
Mar 01 08:34:58 <mlu>	dminuoso: they gave me a virtual optical fiber instead
Mar 01 08:35:09 <mlu>	scottpedia: eventually, that is :)
Mar 01 08:35:21 <mlu>	I imagine you can curve around the sun, but after enough orbits, it'll just tangle into the sun
Mar 01 08:35:44 <marcopolo1>	It would probably get interference from sun radiation
Mar 01 08:35:54 <mlu>	or actually, oo, imagine if you just looped it above the orbital plane
Mar 01 08:36:22 <dminuoso>	mlu: Oh I like that. 10GBASE-LRoverIP
Mar 01 08:36:24 <scottpedia>	mlu: the cable would be so heavy that both planets' orbits are affected mlu 
Mar 01 08:36:34 <Whiskey`>	oh e-m fiber would be easy
Mar 01 08:36:41 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: LRoverIP? lol
Mar 01 08:36:44 <mlu>	I'd be more worried about the cable's ability to keep itself together
Mar 01 08:36:55 <dminuoso>	mlu: Is that what you meant? :-P
Mar 01 08:37:05 <Whiskey`>	we had to work it up in one of my math classes cause a dipshit smarted off
Mar 01 08:37:37 <Whiskey`>	mlu: you loop over the north or south and just push extra out of the ecliptic
Mar 01 08:37:52 <scottpedia>	but inter-planetary communications can indeed untilize fiber optics over laser
Mar 01 08:38:12 <mlu>	oh yeah, we live in a 3D universe
Mar 01 08:38:33 <dminuoso>	"fiber optics over laser"
Mar 01 08:38:34 <Whiskey`>	=_
Mar 01 08:38:45 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: Do you realize that fiber optics has that word... fiber... in it?
Mar 01 08:38:48 *	mlu wonders how much mass the fiber will necessarily be, even if it was made out of the usual stuff, which would of course break
Mar 01 08:38:57 <scottpedia>	free of radio interference and frenquency unavailabilities dminuoso 
Mar 01 08:39:02 <mlu>	dminuoso: reminds me of the concept of "wireless T3"
Mar 01 08:39:21 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: but they've done it before
Mar 01 08:39:31 <Whiskey`>	mlu: carbon fiber would be more than strong enough
Mar 01 08:39:55 <scottpedia>	i odn't know or i don't remember the exact term for that kind of technologies
Mar 01 08:39:58 <dminuoso>	scottpedia: Yes, laser communication is being worked on actively. See https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-tech-demo-streams-first-video-from-deep-space-via-laser
Mar 01 08:40:00 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: 
Mar 01 08:40:04 <mlu>	I wonder how much rotational energy would be at the endpoints
Mar 01 08:40:15 <dminuoso>	But thats not fiber optics, its just.. well optics.
Mar 01 08:40:16 <marcopolo1>	The cable would pull planets out of their orbit if its strong enough not to break
Mar 01 08:40:23 <Whiskey`>	eh the same as the delta between e/m
Mar 01 08:40:32 <scottpedia>	dminuoso: right
Mar 01 08:40:38 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: no, it would not.
Mar 01 08:40:44 <Whiskey`>	marcopolo1: who said you were anchoring the cable to the core of the planet?
Mar 01 08:40:47 <mlu>	oh yeah, light travels thru vacuum faster than it does thru a fiber optic
Mar 01 08:41:08 <scottpedia>	they even to do for ultra-long range AP briges dminuoso 
Mar 01 08:41:16 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: you cannot construct a cable strong enough to do that. At the point where you have enough tensile strength, your mass would be so high that gravity will become the dominant factor.
Mar 01 08:41:42 *	mlu imagines the cable collapsing in on itself
Mar 01 08:41:43 <Whiskey`>	dminuoso: discounting unobtainium are you?
Mar 01 08:42:13 <scottpedia>	but within atmosphere there's defraction over air dminuoso 
Mar 01 08:42:14 <dminuoso>	Well you would need Unobtainum-227 at least.
Mar 01 08:42:16 <scottpedia>	mlu: 
Mar 01 08:43:16 <dminuoso>	marcopolo1: but even with unobtainium, these bodies are in motion relative to eath other. Connecting that cable would.. cause quite a problem.
Mar 01 08:43:20 <mlu>	in real life, everything would be bouncy
Mar 01 08:43:29 <mlu>	"oops, I accidentally deorbited the planet"
Mar 01 08:43:36 <dminuoso>	Somebody ought to do the math on that, whether it would be enough to rip the planet into pieces.
Mar 01 08:43:57 <scottpedia>	mlu: i forgot. gravitational lensing would have an effect on that as well
Mar 01 08:43:58 <Whiskey`>	oy
Mar 01 08:44:06 <Whiskey`>	no you just orbit the ends
Mar 01 08:44:23 <Whiskey`>	just liek a space elevator wouldnt connected to the planted but by gravity
Mar 01 08:44:29 <mlu>	hmm, but wait, wouldn't that cause enough force to rip the fiber apart?
Mar 01 08:44:37 <mlu>	i.e. it'd almost be like centrifuging the fiber
Mar 01 08:44:52 <Whiskey`>	you come it on the pole
Mar 01 08:45:05 <mlu>	p2p -- pole to pole
Mar 01 08:45:26 <Whiskey`>	really you would have grav stress releasing stations but meh
Mar 01 08:45:29 <marcopolo1>	We would need to place an object midway from earth to mars but far under the sun and link both planets to that single object
Mar 01 08:45:39 <Whiskey`>	no
Mar 01 08:46:11 <mlu>	if you were to realistically do this, you'd use wireless, and you'd have a relay satellite at the L2 point
Mar 01 08:46:34 <Whiskey`>	that would never work as the ends would be linked to that. you would need to gravitationaly lock the ends nad let the middle swing free
Mar 01 08:46:57 <Whiskey`>	mlu: oh for sure. starlink already has plans for long range optics
Mar 01 08:47:25 <Whiskey`>	they have a 5 or 6 sat test for the moon
Mar 01 08:47:39 <scottpedia>	mlu: l2 of earth-sun or earth-moon?
Mar 01 08:47:45 <marcopolo1>	Never say never
Mar 01 08:48:03 <mlu>	scottpedia: earth-sun
Mar 01 08:48:13 <scottpedia>	mlu: okay
Mar 01 08:48:27 <scottpedia>	solar power would be a problem then mlu 
Mar 01 08:48:35 <Whiskey`>	really we would have relays in all the l1/l2 points
Mar 01 08:48:39 <Whiskey`>	for both e and m
Mar 01 08:48:40 <scottpedia>	use RTG then? mlu 
Mar 01 08:48:57 <Whiskey`>	scottpedia: no, why? solar panels are dirt cheap
Mar 01 08:49:14 <scottpedia>	Whiskey`: there's hardly any solar power at l2 of earth-sun
Mar 01 08:49:26 <scottpedia>	it's directly in the earth's shadow most of the times
Mar 01 08:49:27 <Whiskey`>	there is lots
Mar 01 08:49:35 <marcopolo1>	Imagine if we could link two object through a magnetic connection
Mar 01 08:49:46 <Whiskey`>	you know that spot isnt the size of a dime
Mar 01 08:49:55 <marcopolo1>	And use internet with that
Mar 01 08:49:56 <Whiskey`>	you just go to the edges and orbit it
Mar 01 08:50:06 <Whiskey`>	marcopolo1: yea its called RF
Mar 01 08:50:43 <marcopolo1>	Use the earths magnetic field and connect it t mars field
Mar 01 08:50:58 <scottpedia>	Whiskey`: have to do the math. dunno how large the earth is in the view from that point
Mar 01 08:51:02 <Whiskey`>	yea no you dont want ot go modulating a planets em like that
Mar 01 08:51:32 <scottpedia>	if you make the halo orbit too enlarged the fuel consumptions would be pretty high
Mar 01 08:52:01 <Whiskey`>	thats why you use solar panel sails. look them up
Mar 01 08:52:19 <scottpedia>	just solar panels, not sails
Mar 01 08:52:30 <Whiskey`>	....
Mar 01 08:52:34 <Whiskey`>	no
Mar 01 08:52:39 <Whiskey`>	you use combo units
Mar 01 08:52:48 <Whiskey`>	gives you 'free' stationkeeping
Mar 01 08:53:00 <mlu>	scottpedia: what do you mean there's hardly any? :D
Mar 01 08:53:14 <mlu>	scottpedia: the sun shines 24/7 there
Mar 01 08:53:15 <Whiskey`>	this is has already been designed and thought to work. someone has a test to see but its like in the 30's
Mar 01 08:53:34 <scottpedia>	mlu: the l2 point is directly in the shadow of the earth? is it not?
Mar 01 08:53:44 <Whiskey`>	scottpedia: jfc
Mar 01 08:53:47 <Whiskey`>	you a flat earther?
Mar 01 08:53:53 <scottpedia>	or maybe that's l1? i can't remember
Mar 01 08:53:56 <Whiskey`>	the l2 is what 2mil km away
Mar 01 08:54:16 <Whiskey`>	the erf is tiny at that distance. you cna easily /not/ be in the shadow
Mar 01 08:54:23 <Whiskey`>	and its not like its black out there
Mar 01 08:54:36 <Whiskey`>	if it were, the jwst wouldnt need a multi layer sun sheild
Mar 01 08:54:42 <scottpedia>	i don't remember cause they put the JWST there for exactly for reason
Mar 01 08:54:48 <scottpedia>	that*
Mar 01 08:55:07 <Whiskey`>	and look at the orbit it has to do to /stay/ in that tiny spot of shadow
Mar 01 08:55:25 <Whiskey`>	they put it there cause its grav stable
Mar 01 08:55:35 <mlu>	btw, I messed up, I actually meant L4 or L5 :)
Mar 01 08:56:14 <mlu>	because then, either you have line of sight to mars, or you just relay off the L4 / L5
Mar 01 08:56:20 <Whiskey`>	mlu: we would use all the l points for relays
Mar 01 08:56:42 <scottpedia>	mlu: l4 and l5 costs too much fuel to get there
Mar 01 08:57:00 <Whiskey`>	scottpedia: bullshit, not for a inter planet network
Mar 01 08:57:08 <scottpedia>	i mean if the payload if heavy
Mar 01 08:57:16 <scottpedia>	is*
Mar 01 08:57:25 <Whiskey`>	still doesnt matter
Mar 01 08:57:54 <Whiskey`>	you dont need spit all to get off the moon to anypalce
Mar 01 08:57:58 <mlu>	scottpedia: the payload would be light, and if we ever had a need for such a network, it'd be cheap enough
Mar 01 08:58:56 <scottpedia>	i rememeber seeing an image of the lunar reconaissance orbiter. but is it in l2 or l1 i can't remember
Mar 01 08:59:02 <scottpedia>	mlu: right
Mar 01 08:59:21 <scottpedia>	but it's kind of far isn't it? the transmission power's gonna be high also.
Mar 01 08:59:34 <Whiskey`>	uhg
Mar 01 08:59:37 <Whiskey`>	no
Mar 01 09:00:05 <Whiskey`>	it takes more power to get past the earths atmo, than from the moon to mars orbit
Mar 01 09:00:34 <scottpedia>	right
Mar 01 09:00:59 <scottpedia>	but i mean if you are at l4 then you gotta point to 2 different directions right?
Mar 01 09:01:13 <Whiskey`>	so?
Mar 01 09:01:14 <scottpedia>	each at a quite long distance
Mar 01 09:01:30 <Whiskey`>	we use 100 watts to get from mars to earth
Mar 01 09:01:33 <Whiskey`>	so
Mar 01 09:01:40 <Whiskey`>	distance doesnt matter that much in space
Mar 01 09:01:51 <Whiskey`>	once you /get/ there, weak signals go lightyears
Mar 01 09:01:51 <scottpedia>	ok alright i see
Mar 01 09:01:55 <mlu>	heh, we can even talk to voyager 1 / voyager 2 which are way further away
Mar 01 09:02:00 <mlu>	i.e. past the bow shock
Mar 01 09:02:04 <Whiskey`>	^^^
Mar 01 09:02:27 <mlu>	ad fwiw, voyager 1 / voyager 2 are equipped with ~800W RTGs
Mar 01 09:02:28 <Whiskey`>	and if we need 'mo powa!' we cna make the antennas bigger
Mar 01 09:02:31 <scottpedia>	yeah but their comm is like morse code or something
Mar 01 09:02:35 <scottpedia>	really slow
Mar 01 09:02:42 <mlu>	we wouldn't even need taht for L4/L5 due to the easy availability of solar
Mar 01 09:02:44 <Whiskey`>	like, who cares if its a 30 ft parabola?
Mar 01 09:03:00 <mlu>	scottpedia: that's because voyager 1 and voyager 2 are ancient technology
Mar 01 09:03:17 <mlu>	we're talking 70s
Mar 01 09:03:24 <Whiskey`>	because that was state of the art at the time. and they knew they needed something that was reliable /at ever longer distances/
Mar 01 09:03:57 <mlu>	it's just the cost of a typical space mission to send up satellites to L4/L5
Mar 01 09:04:02 <Whiskey`>	a bit of math nad we can know the exact longest a E-Lx path will ever be nad built kit to fit exactly that
Mar 01 09:04:15 <fef>	when i connect protonvpn to duckduckgo been getting RST-ACK flag what to do????????????????
Mar 01 09:04:15 <mlu>	solar will be sufficient, and bandwidth won't be a problem, but latency will
Mar 01 09:04:35 <mlu>	fef: overthrow the govenrment of China
Mar 01 09:04:35 <Whiskey`>	mlu: id say less, since we wouldnt do this till we had manuf on the moon. so much cheaper than a earth launch
Mar 01 09:05:00 <Whiskey`>	yea latency will be killer. wont be using classic tcp/ip
Mar 01 09:05:04 <fef>	what? mlu  :/
Mar 01 09:05:13 <Whiskey`>	maaaaybe we could just add months to the ttl
Mar 01 09:05:25 <fef>	how is china related to my issue? mlu
Mar 01 09:05:26 <mlu>	it'll be like the old days of fedex
Mar 01 09:05:41 <Whiskey`>	mlu: missing 90% of packages?
Mar 01 09:05:52 <mlu>	fef: oh, uh, whatever evil government that's having a firewall interfere with your connection
Mar 01 09:05:58 <mlu>	Whiskey`: so send them 10 times :P
Mar 01 09:06:19 <Whiskey`>	mlu: i bet we would send packets say 3 times
Mar 01 09:06:26 <scottpedia>	mlu: i don't think so. cause the hosts aren't in china are they?
Mar 01 09:06:41 <fef>	mlu how to find out that? mlu 
Mar 01 09:06:42 *	mlu shrugs
Mar 01 09:06:51 <fef>	have simple ufw
Mar 01 09:06:55 <mlu>	fef: where's the endpoint of your VPN?
Mar 01 09:07:00 <Whiskey`>	scottpedia: its neigh impossible to find a mitm host that is rst'n you
Mar 01 09:07:13 <fef>	ddg mlu
Mar 01 09:07:19 <Whiskey`>	cause there isnt any method for host checking such packets
Mar 01 09:07:22 <mlu>	fef: also, if you are in an unfriendly country, the systems may detect ProtonVPN packets and act accordingly
Mar 01 09:07:22 <Whiskey`>	lel
Mar 01 09:07:49 <scottpedia>	Whiskey`: i mean there's nothing in bewteeen the vpn server and duckduckgo
Mar 01 09:07:55 <fef>	can connect ddg without vpn but with protonvpn its not possible mlu
Mar 01 09:08:11 <mlu>	maybe yourISP is filtering out protonvpn
Mar 01 09:08:11 <Whiskey`>	scottpedia: no nothing at all excepot THE ENTIRE DAMN INTERNET
Mar 01 09:08:23 <scottpedia>	the traffic doesn't go through china if neither is in China right?
Mar 01 09:08:27 <mlu>	oes anything else work?
Mar 01 09:08:33 <mlu>	scottpedia: not necessarily
Mar 01 09:08:44 <mlu>	scottpedia: I've had packets from San Franciso to Vorozneh route through China
Mar 01 09:08:54 <mlu>	Vorozneh is a city ~100km south of Moscow
Mar 01 09:08:57 <fef>	mlu whats wrong in my case why on earth RST ACK?
Mar 01 09:09:11 <mlu>	fef: too many dropped packets to maintain connectivity
Mar 01 09:09:27 <fef>	mlu connection is pretty stable
Mar 01 09:09:32 <scottpedia>	yes but RST only targes the address that requested te connection right? mlu 
Mar 01 09:09:47 <fef>	mlu able to connect to other search engine except the great ddg
Mar 01 09:09:55 <scottpedia>	they can't just like spray the rst all over the place can they?
Mar 01 09:10:11 <scottpedia>	this is not like dns
Mar 01 09:10:51 <mlu>	scottpedia: it'll be the equivalent of an unusable unstable connection if the drops are on the VPN packets itself
Mar 01 09:11:09 <mlu>	scottpedia: in the countries with firewalls, they actually do exactly that!
Mar 01 09:11:34 <scottpedia>	mlu: but if you drop vpn packets vpn will disconnect and the browser wouldn't be RST right?
Mar 01 09:12:16 <mlu>	scottpedia: the VPN might get in a werid state and be forced to RST
Mar 01 09:12:27 <fef>	mlu, how to solve the issue?
Mar 01 09:12:40 <mlu>	fef: not much you can do
Mar 01 09:12:42 <scottpedia>	i don't think they do that to traffic of foreign origins. do you have a source for that? this is the first time i heard about that kind of operation. mlu 
Mar 01 09:12:47 <mlu>	fef: maybe ddg is blocking your VPN?
Mar 01 09:13:07 <mlu>	scottpedia: pretty standard for great firewall fo china
Mar 01 09:13:39 <mlu>	scottpedia: they can just target ranges instead of be completely random
Mar 01 09:13:43 <scottpedia>	mlu: but the browser's traffic is completely encapsulated i don't think the VPN traffic will interfere with what's inside
Mar 01 09:13:59 <mlu>	scottpedia: on the outside, you can still see that it's VPN
Mar 01 09:14:12 <mlu>	you just don't know exactly what goes on inside
Mar 01 09:14:17 <mlu>	now, can you target ddg specifically? no
Mar 01 09:14:20 <scottpedia>	but how to you reset the traffic inside by resetting the VPN?
Mar 01 09:14:34 <mlu>	scottpedia: you don't -- not directly
Mar 01 09:14:37 <scottpedia>	it would just disconnect right?
Mar 01 09:14:50 <mlu>	scottpedia: you cuase teh VPN to have a condition that results in a RST
Mar 01 09:14:57 <mlu>	well, define disconnect
Mar 01 09:15:06 <scottpedia>	like vpn client disconnects
Mar 01 09:15:06 <mlu>	a RST is actually pretty much "just disconnect"
Mar 01 09:15:23 <mlu>	oh, no, not necessarly -- in fact, for VPNs that work over UDP, there isn't even really the concept of connection
Mar 01 09:15:31 <scottpedia>	but the RST in fef 's case is from the browser right?
Mar 01 09:15:37 <mlu>	it's from the VPN
Mar 01 09:16:01 <scottpedia>	the RST is from VPN? didn't he say that it's when he was trying to connect to ddg?
Mar 01 09:16:04 <mlu>	ie.. some packets get dropped, and then the other end sees "oh wait, this connection state is all messed up, here's a RST"
Mar 01 09:16:44 <scottpedia>	yeah but the reset's in the browser is it not?
Mar 01 09:16:48 <mlu>	could be from the VPN endpiont (if it lost sync), could be from ddg
Mar 01 09:16:58 <mlu>	scottpedia: no, RST is just a flag on a TCP packet
Mar 01 09:17:20 <scottpedia>	so fef did network inspection and found out about that? mlu 
Mar 01 09:17:23 <mlu>	i.e. his system received a RST packet on the connection that the browser established
Mar 01 09:17:28 <mlu>	scottpedia: yeah
Mar 01 09:17:38 <scottpedia>	but that's still encapsulated right?
Mar 01 09:17:40 <mlu>	assuming the info is accurate, that's how you would see the RST
Mar 01 09:17:43 <mlu>	scottpedia: sure
Mar 01 09:18:03 <mlu>	i.e. the RST is a side effect of dropping packets on the VPN
Mar 01 09:18:27 <scottpedia>	then how does any system insert an RST into the supposedly discovered VPN packet without knowing the encryption key?
Mar 01 09:18:37 <scottpedia>	mlu: can you link me to a source of that?
Mar 01 09:18:53 <mlu>	scottpedia: it doesn't
Mar 01 09:19:00 <mlu>	scottpedia: it causes a RST, it doesn't insert a RST
Mar 01 09:19:28 <scottpedia>	but the VPN would first disconnect first and then the browser would say "network changed" and that's it
Mar 01 09:19:35 <mlu>	scottpedia: not necessarily
Mar 01 09:19:47 <mlu>	it depends on the number of packets dropped and where
Mar 01 09:19:54 <fef>	scottpedia, its not from browser
Mar 01 09:20:17 <fef>	curl or others test give same result.
Mar 01 09:20:31 <scottpedia>	mlu: so you are saying the vpn doesn't disconnect, and then the browser shows the RST result from the firewall?
Mar 01 09:20:38 <mlu>	i.e. I can't make a dog yelp, but if I kicked the dog, it might yelp in response
Mar 01 09:21:02 <mlu>	scottpedia: VPN doesn't disconnect, but enoguh packets are dropped from the connection inside the VPN that the other end sends a RST
Mar 01 09:21:42 <scottpedia>	the other end means the ddg? mlu 
Mar 01 09:21:52 <mlu>	scottpedia: yeah
Mar 01 09:22:06 <mlu>	or any hop on the way can theoretically send a RST too
Mar 01 09:22:49 <scottpedia>	okay but why isn't the RST packet dropped also? can the firewall read what's inside? mlu 
Mar 01 09:23:08 <scottpedia>	in any case the VPN would disconnect first right?
Mar 01 09:24:48 <scottpedia>	mlu: anyways just send me a link of the article where they published the findings.
Mar 01 09:29:08 <scottpedia>	in my understanding the chinese firewall doesn't target encrypted traffic that way. the RST is reserved more onto the plain text http when certain words are triggered
Mar 01 09:30:21 <scottpedia>	for blacklisted sites or IPs they just route you to whatever random destination cause the firewall software is written into the routers themselves
Mar 01 09:30:49 <scottpedia>	anyways just send me the links cause i am interested thank you mlu 
Mar 01 09:44:26 <fef>	no idea why ddg hate protonvpn
Mar 01 13:11:21 <fairway>	 currently my internet ipv6 is working but not ipv4.  why is internet almost useless without ipv4
Mar 01 13:14:22 <endre>	it's a chicken-egg problem
Mar 01 13:14:39 <endre>	there's no supply without demand
Mar 01 13:20:22 <fairway>	 currently my internet ipv6 is working but not ipv4.  why is internet almost useless without ipv4
Mar 01 13:21:50 <elektrinis>	hi.
Mar 01 13:21:55 <Allie>	because for many people, 'internet' is synonymous with 'ipv4' 
Mar 01 13:21:57 <Allie>	it's annoying.
Mar 01 13:22:08 <X-Scale>	with the widespread deployment of CGNATs IPv4 risks surviving forever as the main protocol stack
Mar 01 13:22:29 <elektrinis>	question... Can I share a file in a P2P way, without cloud and without any special software on client side?
Mar 01 13:22:40 <elektrinis>	and of course I'm behind a NAT
Mar 01 13:22:57 <Allie>	elektrinis: you'll need some kind of software, but it doesn't have to be complicated
Mar 01 13:23:13 <elektrinis>	maaaaaybe the client would visit a http link and a VPN is opened to me within the browser?
Mar 01 13:23:32 <Allie>	where would that link be hosted? 
Mar 01 13:23:40 <elektrinis>	on my pc
Mar 01 13:23:58 <Allie>	can't you host the file on your PC and just have them pull it over http? 
Mar 01 13:23:59 <elektrinis>	with maybe a coordinator on public ip
Mar 01 13:24:16 <Allie>	you said 'no cloud', which i assume means 'no external servers' 
Mar 01 13:24:24 <elektrinis>	the coordinator could handle the handshake, but transfer should be direct
Mar 01 13:24:42 <elektrinis>	similar to tailscale maybe
Mar 01 13:24:48 <elektrinis>	but no software on client side
Mar 01 13:25:09 <elektrinis>	I don't want to force my clients to install dodgy stuff
Mar 01 13:26:03 <Allie>	'dodgy stuff'? 
Mar 01 13:26:26 <elektrinis>	anything they would need to do before downloading my shared file
Mar 01 13:26:37 <elektrinis>	no downloaders, no p2p client
Mar 01 13:26:49 <elektrinis>	it should be entirely browser based
Mar 01 13:27:20 <elektrinis>	maaaybe some kind web based torrent client?
Mar 01 13:27:29 <Allie>	elektrinis: have a play with this: https://github.com/szimek/sharedrop
Mar 01 13:28:17 <elektrinis>	hmm, will do, thanks
Mar 01 13:42:58 <djph>	wait
Mar 01 13:44:42 <djph>	Allie: if they're all on the same network already, why not just a NFS/samba share (or worst case, sneakernet)
Mar 01 13:45:01 <Allie>	maybe they're not :D
Mar 01 13:45:02 <djph>	... I think I'm missing context, to the scrollback... 
Mar 01 13:45:04 <Allie>	yes
Mar 01 13:45:19 <Allie>	i'm assuming there are horrible NATs in the way
Mar 01 13:45:21 <Allie>	there often are
Mar 01 13:45:59 <djph>	$5 / month public VPS
Mar 01 13:46:01 <djph>	:D
Mar 01 13:46:18 <djph>	or hell, dropbox/gdrive/nextcloud/etc
Mar 01 13:46:44 <Allie>	12:23:59 <+Allie> can't you host the file on your PC and just have them pull it over http? 
Mar 01 13:47:01 <elektrinis>	www.sharedrop.io
Mar 01 13:47:04 <djph>	granted, none of these options are "p2p" (but then again, outside of torrents or similar, nothing really is)
Mar 01 13:47:04 <elektrinis>	fund this
Mar 01 13:47:07 <elektrinis>	looks cool
Mar 01 13:47:11 <elektrinis>	www.sharedrop.io
Mar 01 13:47:14 <elektrinis>	oops
Mar 01 13:47:40 <djph>	elektrinis: I have my own http server, why would I bother with some random other service?
Mar 01 13:48:08 <elektrinis>	agree, I have several as well. Will host myself once I see it's what I need
Mar 01 13:53:44 <Allie>	elektrinis: yes that's... what i told you to look at :P
Mar 01 13:55:15 <elektrinis83>	oops, timed out
Mar 01 13:55:32 <elektrinis83>	ok, sharedrop works.
Mar 01 13:55:51 <elektrinis83>	first problem is that you need to connect first, and only then you can share a file
Mar 01 13:56:43 <elektrinis83>	shich is extra steps, especially if sharing is done via email etc
Mar 01 13:57:20 <fairway>	why does libera support ipv6 but discord/github cannot
Mar 01 13:57:44 <elektrinis83>	I'd like the same thing, but instead of sharing a link to connect first, I want to share a link to both connect and download the file
Mar 01 13:57:53 <djph>	fairway: because Microsoft
Mar 01 13:58:16 <djph>	elektrinis83: so ... stick it on a server that has the file, send the link to your friend
Mar 01 13:58:16 <fairway>	www.microsoft.com is ipv6 ready
Mar 01 13:58:26 <djph>	fairway: and they own github, so... 
Mar 01 13:58:36 <djph>	it's their fault github doesn't have AAAA records
Mar 01 13:58:37 <fairway>	they why does microsoft.com works fine with ipv6
Mar 01 13:58:49 <fairway>	then add the AAAA record
Mar 01 13:58:56 <fairway>	that's hard to do
Mar 01 13:58:58 <Blondie101010>	why are you asking taht?
Mar 01 13:58:59 <fairway>	that's NOT hard to do
Mar 01 13:59:05 <djph>	fairway: yes, Microsoft would have to do that.
Mar 01 13:59:09 <Blondie101010>	we are not microsoft

Mar 01 14:01:42 <fairway>	how come i can connect to  https://1xbet.com/en   but website does not load
Mar 01 14:02:05 <fairway>	with ipv6 only connection
Mar 01 14:02:49 <fairway>	can anybody go to  https://1xbet.com/en  with ipv6 onlly connection
Mar 01 14:03:06 <djph>	firewall issue on one end or the other, some required *something* that can only be accessed via v4 ... 
Mar 01 14:03:37 <Gurkenglas>	fairway: i would guess it's a difference between being theoretically hard and practically hard, like changing away from a first-past-the-post voting system
Mar 01 14:04:20 <fairway>	djph what is the point supporting ipv6 then, if one cannot even use it via ipv6
Mar 01 14:04:25 <Allie>	fairway: you should probably ask them. i'm assuming that's some kind of online casino - i guess it's not in their interest to expend the engineering resource to provide v6 connectivity
Mar 01 14:04:31 <Allie>	maybe it's just broken 
Mar 01 14:04:33 <Allie>	who knows
Mar 01 14:05:28 <djph>	fairway: your best bet would be talking to them. Maybe they've just broken something on accident that isn't noticed when using dualstack
Mar 01 14:06:43 <fairway>	if so many website are having problem with ipv6,  was it hard for libera to support ipv6
Mar 01 14:08:53 <needle>	it it always hard, not only for libera
Mar 01 14:09:25 <needle>	ipv6 is the brand new technology..
Mar 01 14:09:32 <djph>	only 25 years old :)
Mar 01 14:09:33 <needle>	that has been for 25 years here.
Mar 01 14:09:35 <needle>	;)
Mar 01 14:10:21 <needle>	I belive IPv6 problem is IT people's problem. networking or people doing networks do ipv6 naturally
Mar 01 14:10:24 <needle>	since decades
Mar 01 14:10:42 <djph>	more or less
Mar 01 14:10:46 <needle>	with emphasis on _I belive_.
Mar 01 14:10:58 <Allie>	needle: that is an incredibly optimistic worldview :D
Mar 01 14:10:59 <Thurmond>	even many of my networking colleagues are afraid of IPv6
Mar 01 14:11:05 <djph>	the hard part (for me) is going "oh wait, no I can't subnet this further"
Mar 01 14:11:17 <Thurmond>	djph, i mean, you CAN
Mar 01 14:11:26 <djph>	not from SLAAC tho
Mar 01 14:11:37 <Thurmond>	yeah i *wouldn't* on a leaf network
Mar 01 14:11:43 <needle>	Allie: It strongly depends on what kind of networks people support and operate. You are right on that. Everyone judges from own perspective.
Mar 01 14:12:01 <Thurmond>	i kinda like /124s on point-to-point VLANs
Mar 01 14:12:13 <Allie>	I work in TV with a focus on IP video, there are some very v6-first deployments and some which don't touch v6 at all
Mar 01 14:12:26 <djph>	Thurmond: exactly - that's all I have to play with; so "eh fuck it, the ISP will give me a /56"
Mar 01 14:13:10 <Thurmond>	^
Mar 01 14:13:19 <elektrinis83>	finally !!!! https://toffeeshare.com/
Mar 01 14:13:28 <elektrinis83>	this one does not need connecting
Mar 01 14:14:12 <needle>	Interesting, I do not know anyone doing IP in TV networks, form the networking people. It is a complete different networking area, I know with own solutions and own protocols.
Mar 01 14:15:12 <needle>	In the SP sector, IPv6 is everywhere, you just do not operate a backbone w/o having IPv6.
Mar 01 14:15:27 <Thurmond>	SP?
Mar 01 14:15:28 <needle>	just data and peering doing over here
Mar 01 14:15:35 <needle>	Service Provider.
Mar 01 14:15:39 <Thurmond>	ah
Mar 01 14:16:02 <Thurmond>	i should really get an allocation from my upstream.  they're not idiots.  i'm sure they can do it.  hell, they peer directly with Hurricane Electric.
Mar 01 14:16:44 <Allie>	needle: I am ex-service provider, TV is far more fun though :D
Mar 01 14:17:14 <needle>	IPv4 is rather dead, if you read the RFC's most inventions or new networking protocols work nowadays only on IPv6 yes IPv4 too, but IPv4 is not that in focus anymore.
Mar 01 14:22:26 <djph>	elektrinis83: apparently the share only lives as long as your browser is open ... 
Mar 01 14:34:25 <fairway>	needle ipv4 should be dead but it's not
Mar 01 14:34:51 <fairway>	i cannot even access like more than 75% of websites without ipv4
Mar 01 14:35:05 <fairway>	i cannot even access like more than 75% of websites with ipv6 only internet
Mar 01 14:44:13 <hjf>	hm idk what i'm looking for.. i have a rack mount switch mounted to the wall with an L bracket. is there some sort of L bracket 4U...thing?
Mar 01 14:45:06 <hjf>	ooo seems it's called a "verticall wall mount rack"
Mar 01 14:46:51 <hjf>	hm they're like $40
Mar 01 14:47:13 <hjf>	guess i can make this easily with some angle iron
Mar 01 14:56:05 <Blondie101010>	your switch is probably too small to put attached poorly to a much bigger rack
