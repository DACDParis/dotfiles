Feb 21 21:00:32 <dgilmore>	nirik: trying to build a livecd locally to test if increasing the filesystem a bit is enough to make it work. and I am trying to remeber if there is ianything special to run lmc inside of mock. at the moment anaconda seems to die and everything becomes a zombie
Feb 21 21:01:37 <dgilmore>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265238#c1 also makes me wonder if we have different types of builders with slightly different instruction sets and a bug in python or a module not building code generically 
Feb 21 21:29:05 <nirik>	kinda reminds me of https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2247319 but I don't think we have seen it in a while... I dont think there's anything super special, just --novirt in mock... 
Feb 21 21:30:17 <nirik>	or perhaps thats the same thing? not sure.

Feb 23 01:04:59 <dgilmore>	nirik: do we have some older AArch64 builders?
Feb 23 01:12:02 <nirik>	we have some emags still... we have no mustangs left... 
Feb 23 02:10:49 <dgilmore>	I was wondering if the AArch64  livemedia illegal instruction issue was some newer instruction ending up in the code, however, I saw a successful one on an emag, and a cavium box
Feb 23 02:11:07 <dgilmore>	I could power on my mustang. 
Feb 23 02:12:11 <dgilmore>	I have an ampere desktop and qualcom laptop I use daily 
Feb 23 02:22:53 <nirik>	I have some mt snow boxes I am going to move in as builders, just haven't gotten the cycles to yet. 
Feb 23 04:20:53 <dgilmore>	the lmc bug illegal instruction error is weird
