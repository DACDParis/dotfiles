Feb 21 17:09:31 <Bombo>	i'm able to connect to the pi via ssh and kill kodi, but i can not start kodi again until i reboot first
Feb 21 17:10:35 <}8]>	what error do you get when you try to restart it?
Feb 21 17:11:22 <}8]>	maybe a privs problem
Feb 21 17:11:57 <Bombo>	no error just doesnt start, mpv gives me a segfault
Feb 21 17:12:54 <Bombo>	i just type kodi<enter> as before, no error i get to the console bash prompt again
Feb 21 17:36:53 <Bombo>	hm in the kodi.log i see error because /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/kodi/addons is empry
Feb 21 18:45:47 <DjSlash>	if mpv segfaults, there might be something else wrong
Feb 21 18:46:56 <DjSlash>	I have Kodi installed on raspbian bookworm and it works fine
Feb 21 19:19:27 <Bombo>	only after kodi crashed
Feb 21 19:19:53 <Bombo>	kodi works after fresh reboot, i can play videos etc
Feb 21 19:20:42 <Bombo>	just when i visit the settings player video, and hit cursor down to the prime entries, then boom
Feb 21 19:23:02 <Bombo>	it's kodi 20.3 nothing newer in the debian repo/backports
Feb 21 19:25:11 <Bombo>	DjSlash: which raspi you got? pi 3b 1.2
Feb 21 19:27:32 <Bombo>	it's a fresh raspios install, with no ~/.kodi/
Feb 21 19:29:07 <Bombo>	kodi.log says 20.30 git:20240110-* so pretty recen 
Feb 21 19:29:11 <Bombo>	t
Feb 21 19:29:14 <Bombo>	hm

Feb 21 22:21:21 <strk>	`info <general>: CDVDVideoCodecFFmpeg::Open() Using codec: H.264 / AVC / MPEG-4 AVC / MPEG-4 part 10`
Feb 21 22:21:29 <strk>	but no sound comes out and pulseaudio doesn't even see kodi sending audio
Feb 21 22:21:43 <strk>	maybe due to this? info <general>: CVideoPlayerAudio::Process - stream stalled
Feb 21 22:21:58 <strk>	or this, printed right before: info <general>: CDVDVideoCodecFFmpeg::CDropControl: calculated diff time: 40000
Feb 21 22:22:04 <daftykins>	please stop pasting part messages
Feb 21 22:22:12 <daftykins>	it's useless
Feb 21 22:23:39 <strk>	for a working stream I see the same messages up to the diff time part (also same number) but no "stream stalled" (sound works)
Feb 21 22:23:52 <strk>	is there a setting I should toggle to improve verbosity ?
Feb 21 22:24:02 <daftykins>	all described on the convenient wiki
Feb 21 22:24:14 <daftykins>	your pasted line referred to the video codec, but nothing for audio which is what you're talking about
Feb 21 22:24:22 <daftykins>	run the file via "MediaInfo" on a desktop OS perhaps
Feb 21 22:25:17 <strk>	oh, it's aac
Feb 21 22:25:23 <strk>	it's a stream, not a file
Feb 21 22:27:10 <daftykins>	ah ok
Feb 21 22:27:12 <strk>	the non-working one never gets to "Creating audio stream"
Feb 21 22:27:32 <daftykins>	verify against something like VLC for if the feed is to blame?
Feb 21 22:29:21 <strk>	it would help if kodi.log contained the URL to the stream. Instead I only get a plugin:// uri
Feb 21 22:30:56 <strk>	firefox is able to decode both video and audio, if I search for the same title on the same publisher website (but dunno if it's the same URI of the stream though)
Feb 21 22:30:58 <daftykins>	perhaps a handy wiki has some extended information on additional logging levels - from addons too

Feb 22 15:46:48 <Guest75>	Hi
Feb 22 15:50:19 <Guest75>	Using Kodi for over 5-6 years. Today I swapped my hard drives with video files and now the folders says no video files! It scraped fine and I can see the list of the movies; permission -all the time for folders is sorted. I've updated the paths to my playlists to include the ones from the new drive, but when I ask kodi to scan the folder it says no
Feb 22 15:50:19 <Guest75>	video files.
Feb 22 15:56:11 <Guest75>	Silent as thE tomb. R.I.P

Mar 04 08:45:08 <DjSlash>	arseru: yes, Arctic Zephyr for sure, but I think several other skins have that too
Mar 04 09:13:25 <arseru>	DjSlash thanks, I'll take a look at it: https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:Arctic:_Zephyr

Mar 05 10:05:47 <Guest47>	Hello guys, I installed kodi however after installing it I get "Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue, has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which means that Firefox can only connect to it securely." On several websites.
Mar 05 10:05:48 <Guest47>	Is this supposed to happen if not, how do I fix it?
Mar 05 10:09:12 <Nei>	either you got a virus infected kodi or it is unrelated to kodi
Mar 05 10:10:18 <Nei>	make sure you get kodi from https://kodi.tv and be careful with piraccy addons 
Mar 05 10:11:49 <Guest47>	I did download from that link and it happened before installing add-ons.
Mar 05 10:11:49 <Guest47>	To check out if kodi caused it, I also installed it on my phone and there the same issue occurs. After deleting the application from my phone it stopped giving these connection errors.
Mar 05 10:11:50 <Guest47>	I uninstalled kodi from my windows laptop but it still occurs
Mar 05 10:12:14 <Nei>	then it is unlikely that this is related to kodi
Mar 05 10:13:48 <Nei>	if you had these issues with your phone while on the same internet line as your PC, try using another internet connection and see if it makes a difference
Mar 05 10:14:51 <Guest47>	I might have found something. When I disconnect my laptop from wifi and use my phone hotspot the sites work
Mar 05 10:14:51 <Guest47>	However the same sites worked when I did not have kodi installed and was on the wifi. So it might be a combination of kodi and the wifi network
Mar 05 10:15:26 <Nei>	you could try restarting your wifi
Mar 05 10:18:09 <Guest11>	It is not my own wifi network but, still strange that it only started occurring after installing kodi.
Mar 05 10:18:09 <Guest11>	ANyway I will wait with it until I am at home on my own network again (currently at a hotel).
Mar 05 10:18:10 <Guest11>	Thank you for the help Nei
Mar 05 10:19:10 <Nei>	don't trust hotel network ;-)
Mar 05 10:19:28 <DjSlash>	it's quite possible that the hotel network has done something 
Mar 05 10:20:11 <Guest11>	Have a nice day
Mar 05 10:20:13 <DjSlash>	that firefox can't reach sites over https is not something that kodi has any influence on
Mar 05 10:21:12 <Guest11>	 the same site worked yesterday during the day. When I did not have kodi installed. ANd since from my side kodi was the only thing that changed I wanted to check if it was a possibility. But the hotel might have changed something on their side
Mar 05 10:32:20 <deebo>	you visited a site that used HSTS previously, and then on hotel wifi they tried to tamper with the connection and firefox reported that
Mar 05 10:32:41 <deebo>	possible trying to present their login portal as the site you requested
