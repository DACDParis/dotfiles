Feb 21 17:09:31 <Bombo>	i'm able to connect to the pi via ssh and kill kodi, but i can not start kodi again until i reboot first
Feb 21 17:10:35 <}8]>	what error do you get when you try to restart it?
Feb 21 17:11:22 <}8]>	maybe a privs problem
Feb 21 17:11:57 <Bombo>	no error just doesnt start, mpv gives me a segfault
Feb 21 17:12:54 <Bombo>	i just type kodi<enter> as before, no error i get to the console bash prompt again
Feb 21 17:36:53 <Bombo>	hm in the kodi.log i see error because /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/kodi/addons is empry
Feb 21 18:45:47 <DjSlash>	if mpv segfaults, there might be something else wrong
Feb 21 18:46:56 <DjSlash>	I have Kodi installed on raspbian bookworm and it works fine
Feb 21 19:19:27 <Bombo>	only after kodi crashed
Feb 21 19:19:53 <Bombo>	kodi works after fresh reboot, i can play videos etc
Feb 21 19:20:42 <Bombo>	just when i visit the settings player video, and hit cursor down to the prime entries, then boom
Feb 21 19:23:02 <Bombo>	it's kodi 20.3 nothing newer in the debian repo/backports
Feb 21 19:25:11 <Bombo>	DjSlash: which raspi you got? pi 3b 1.2
Feb 21 19:27:32 <Bombo>	it's a fresh raspios install, with no ~/.kodi/
Feb 21 19:29:07 <Bombo>	kodi.log says 20.30 git:20240110-* so pretty recen

Feb 21 22:21:21 <strk>	`info <general>: CDVDVideoCodecFFmpeg::Open() Using codec: H.264 / AVC / MPEG-4 AVC / MPEG-4 part 10`
Feb 21 22:21:29 <strk>	but no sound comes out and pulseaudio doesn't even see kodi sending audio
Feb 21 22:21:43 <strk>	maybe due to this? info <general>: CVideoPlayerAudio::Process - stream stalled
Feb 21 22:21:58 <strk>	or this, printed right before: info <general>: CDVDVideoCodecFFmpeg::CDropControl: calculated diff time: 40000
Feb 21 22:22:04 <daftykins>	please stop pasting part messages
Feb 21 22:22:12 <daftykins>	it's useless
Feb 21 22:23:39 <strk>	for a working stream I see the same messages up to the diff time part (also same number) but no "stream stalled" (sound works)
Feb 21 22:23:52 <strk>	is there a setting I should toggle to improve verbosity ?
Feb 21 22:24:02 <daftykins>	all described on the convenient wiki
Feb 21 22:24:14 <daftykins>	your pasted line referred to the video codec, but nothing for audio which is what you're talking about
Feb 21 22:24:22 <daftykins>	run the file via "MediaInfo" on a desktop OS perhaps
Feb 21 22:25:17 <strk>	oh, it's aac
Feb 21 22:25:23 <strk>	it's a stream, not a file
Feb 21 22:27:10 <daftykins>	ah ok
Feb 21 22:27:12 <strk>	the non-working one never gets to "Creating audio stream"
Feb 21 22:27:32 <daftykins>	verify against something like VLC for if the feed is to blame?
Feb 21 22:29:21 <strk>	it would help if kodi.log contained the URL to the stream. Instead I only get a plugin:// uri
Feb 21 22:30:56 <strk>	firefox is able to decode both video and audio, if I search for the same title on the same publisher website (but dunno if it's the same URI of the stream though)
Feb 21 22:30:58 <daftykins>	perhaps a handy wiki has some extended information on additional logging levels - from addons too

Feb 22 15:46:48 <Guest75>	Hi
Feb 22 15:50:19 <Guest75>	Using Kodi for over 5-6 years. Today I swapped my hard drives with video files and now the folders says no video files! It scraped fine and I can see the list of the movies; permission -all the time for folders is sorted. I've updated the paths to my playlists to include the ones from the new drive, but when I ask kodi to scan the folder it says no
Feb 22 15:50:19 <Guest75>	video files.
Feb 22 15:56:11 <Guest75>	Silent as thE tomb. R.I.P

Mar 05 10:05:47 <Guest47>	Hello guys, I installed kodi however after installing it I get "Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue, has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which means that Firefox can only connect to it securely." On several websites.
Mar 05 10:05:48 <Guest47>	Is this supposed to happen if not, how do I fix it?
Mar 05 10:09:12 <Nei>	either you got a virus infected kodi or it is unrelated to kodi
Mar 05 10:10:18 <Nei>	make sure you get kodi from https://kodi.tv and be careful with piraccy addons 
Mar 05 10:11:49 <Guest47>	I did download from that link and it happened before installing add-ons.
Mar 05 10:11:49 <Guest47>	To check out if kodi caused it, I also installed it on my phone and there the same issue occurs. After deleting the application from my phone it stopped giving these connection errors.
Mar 05 10:11:50 <Guest47>	I uninstalled kodi from my windows laptop but it still occurs
Mar 05 10:12:14 <Nei>	then it is unlikely that this is related to kodi
Mar 05 10:13:48 <Nei>	if you had these issues with your phone while on the same internet line as your PC, try using another internet connection and see if it makes a difference
Mar 05 10:14:51 <Guest47>	I might have found something. When I disconnect my laptop from wifi and use my phone hotspot the sites work
Mar 05 10:14:51 <Guest47>	However the same sites worked when I did not have kodi installed and was on the wifi. So it might be a combination of kodi and the wifi network
Mar 05 10:15:26 <Nei>	you could try restarting your wifi
Mar 05 10:18:09 <Guest11>	It is not my own wifi network but, still strange that it only started occurring after installing kodi.
Mar 05 10:18:09 <Guest11>	ANyway I will wait with it until I am at home on my own network again (currently at a hotel).
Mar 05 10:18:10 <Guest11>	Thank you for the help Nei
Mar 05 10:19:10 <Nei>	don't trust hotel network ;-)
Mar 05 10:19:28 <DjSlash>	it's quite possible that the hotel network has done something 
Mar 05 10:20:11 <Guest11>	Have a nice day
Mar 05 10:20:13 <DjSlash>	that firefox can't reach sites over https is not something that kodi has any influence on
Mar 05 10:21:12 <Guest11>	 the same site worked yesterday during the day. When I did not have kodi installed. ANd since from my side kodi was the only thing that changed I wanted to check if it was a possibility. But the hotel might have changed something on their side
Mar 05 10:32:20 <deebo>	you visited a site that used HSTS previously, and then on hotel wifi they tried to tamper with the connection and firefox reported that
Mar 05 10:32:41 <deebo>	possible trying to present their login portal as the site you requested

Mar 10 20:49:24 <Guest80>	Hi, I've just started with Kodi.. I'm having a problem playing DVDs. Whenever I set DVDs to autoplay, the disc will run as expected and the expected title menu appears as it would with a store bought DVD player, however.. after this happens a popup appears in the way of this, asking me to browse the DVD. Is there some way I can disable that
Mar 10 20:49:24 <Guest80>	behaviour and just auto play the DVD?
Mar 10 21:02:06 <Nei>	is the popup menu coming from Windows?
Mar 10 21:05:10 <Guest80>	No, it's a kodi style popup.. the OS is libreelec
Mar 10 21:06:38 <Nei>	ok idk maybe someone else can help you
Mar 10 21:08:41 <Guest80>	Sure, thanks anyway. I'll try it with a OS to see what happens, I was just hoping it was a simple config fix.
Mar 10 21:08:51 <Guest80>	with a live OS*
Mar 10 21:49:23 <Guest80>	Okay, so trying it with a live devuan USB stick.. I found I can play without that annoying popup. The problem was solved by installing and configuring libdvd-pkg.. I could then start with a fresh kodi config and both kodi and kodi-standalone were working fine. I guess then they don't have the normal debian libdvdcss setup in libreelec, or it needs
Mar 10 21:49:24 <Guest80>	manual intervention.
Mar 10 21:50:30 <Guest80>	probably the latter, maybe due to distribution restrictions on dvd libs

Mar 11 09:15:16 <Nei>	or even get rid of them depending on your screen format

Mar 15 13:33:33 <TuxJobs2>	One thing that I do find annoying is that the volume is extremely low on these TV episodes, which they shouldn't be because I've viewed them on the computer as well, but they are in Kodi, and thus I have to press a button on the controller (I use a cheap old USB gamepad to control Kodi) and then increase the dB of loudness compensation (or something like that), but that value seems to reset each time you view it, or perhaps per-file.
Mar 15 13:34:57 <noneoftheabove>	or you play another source and get blasted
Mar 15 13:35:46 <noneoftheabove>	i've got a weird bug i doubt anyone will ever get to the bottom of.  snapcast works great until you play something in kodi, after that it loses its time sync and my tv must be rebooted
Mar 15 13:36:24 <noneoftheabove>	but alas, this is not the forum. this is barking at the moon
Mar 15 13:43:58 <TuxJobs2>	"TV rebooted"...
Mar 15 13:44:05 <TuxJobs2>	I guess modern TVs do "reboot".

Mar 15 13:44:40 <TuxJobs2>	My TV was made about a decade before Google was created.
Mar 15 13:44:42 <noneoftheabove>	TuxJobs2: you'll soon notice nobody talks here
Mar 15 13:44:56 <TuxJobs2>	noneoftheabove: That's the worst thing to notice on IRC.
Mar 15 13:44:56 <noneoftheabove>	kodi devs are not helpful
Mar 15 13:45:10 <TuxJobs2>	:(
Mar 15 13:45:13 <noneoftheabove>	not even in the correct forum
Mar 15 13:46:26 <TuxJobs2>	While I agree that free volunteer help is probably mostly thankless and a pain to deal with, I'm surprised that so few developers seem to "care" in general while running a big and useful project. That goes for all its actual users too, though.
Mar 15 13:47:04 <noneoftheabove>	TuxJobs2: do you have "maintain original volume on downmix" enabled...i do, and still have volume issues...just want to make sure youre aware of that ifi youre downmixing
Mar 15 13:48:41 <TuxJobs2>	noneoftheabove: Hmm... I don't know. (It's cumbersome to check because I'm back at the computer and the TV setup isn't on anymore.) But I have the default settings for basically everything AFAIK.
Mar 15 13:48:55 <TuxJobs2>	Not sure what "downmixing" refers to.
Mar 15 13:49:57 <noneoftheabove>	if the source has 7 channels, but youre outputing to 2
Mar 15 14:08:06 <TuxJobs2>	Well... It's stereo, I suppose. Filmed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Mar 15 14:10:12 <noneoftheabove>	yeah i doubt that was recorded in dolby atmos
Mar 15 14:11:40 <TuxJobs2>	noneoftheabove: "Dolby Atmos is a surround sound technology developed by Dolby Laboratories. It expands on existing surround sound systems by adding height channels, allowing sounds to be interpreted as three-dimensional objects with neither horizontal nor vertical limitations." <-- Sounds fancy.
Mar 15 14:11:54 <TuxJobs2>	I'm not even sure I've even once in my life experienced basic "surround" sound.
Mar 15 14:12:09 <TuxJobs2>	Maybe at the cinema once or twice, long ago.
Mar 15 14:12:46 <TuxJobs2>	Stereo manages to fool my brain quite well.
Mar 15 14:12:56 <noneoftheabove>	lol. wow. 'surround' is just an effect, any stereo from the 90s forward will have it
Mar 15 14:13:04 <noneoftheabove>	stil only 2 channels
Mar 15 14:13:08 <TuxJobs2>	Doesn't surround require more than two loudspeakers?
Mar 15 14:13:12 <noneoftheabove>	no
Mar 15 14:13:22 <TuxJobs2>	That's what I always assumed.
Mar 15 14:13:38 <noneoftheabove>	dolby pro-logic encodes surround sound into 2 channels
Mar 15 14:13:50 <noneoftheabove>	it plays with the phasing to thow the sounds
Mar 15 14:13:54 <noneoftheabove>	*throw
Mar 15 14:14:15 <noneoftheabove>	dolby 5.1 is 6 channels
Mar 15 14:31:39 <TuxJobs2>	My RPI4 has a power on/off button on its power cable. Assuming that I'm in the Kodi menu system (not actively watching a movie), can I just flick it off with the button? Or must I always go through the Kodi/LibreELEC UI and select "shut down" inside it?
Mar 15 14:33:21 <DjSlash>	It's always best to shutdown your computer properly instead of just hitting the powerbutton
Mar 15 14:34:07 <TuxJobs2>	This is a minimal media player and not a computer system with tons of services running at all times, though...
Mar 15 14:34:21 <TuxJobs2>	MS-DOS was possible to "flick off".
Mar 15 14:34:33 <DjSlash>	doesn't matter
Mar 15 14:34:37 <TuxJobs2>	And doing it via the UI is much, much slower and more annoying.
Mar 15 14:34:53 <TuxJobs2>	So you're saying that it's doing things in the background?
Mar 15 14:36:20 <DjSlash>	it might, yes
Mar 15 14:36:56 <TuxJobs2>	Like what?
Mar 15 14:38:40 <DjSlash>	updating libraries, writing logfiles for example
Mar 15 14:39:09 <noneoftheabove>	you can just power off kodi, it doesnt care
Mar 15 14:39:29 <noneoftheabove>	i mean, i dont employ any libraries but i've been doing that for years
Mar 15 14:40:09 <DjSlash>	wouldn't be the first time that someone ends up with a dead sdcard because of it
Mar 15 14:40:13 <noneoftheabove>	it doesnt have any "live" files..it just runs in ram
Mar 15 14:40:23 <noneoftheabove>	sdcard?
Mar 15 14:40:25 <DjSlash>	or a corrupt sqlite database
Mar 15 14:40:31 <noneoftheabove>	no databases.
Mar 15 14:40:45 <DjSlash>	your situation implies on everyone else?
Mar 15 14:40:50 <noneoftheabove>	lol. yes.
Mar 15 14:40:58 <DjSlash>	excellent!
Mar 15 14:41:01 <noneoftheabove>	right?
Mar 15 14:41:06 <noneoftheabove>	problem solved.
Mar 15 14:41:06 <DjSlash>	then go ahead, TuxJobs2 
Mar 15 14:41:15 *	noneoftheabove nods
Mar 15 15:00:59 <TuxJobs2>	...
Mar 15 15:03:08 <noneoftheabove>	lol
Mar 15 15:03:33 <TuxJobs2>	Impossible to get straight answers.
Mar 15 15:03:36 <noneoftheabove>	TuxJobs2: i think if you dont use internal library/database you're fine to just switch it off
Mar 15 15:03:50 <TuxJobs2>	What is "internal library/database" exactly?
Mar 15 15:36:42 <noneoftheabove>	TuxJobs2: media library
