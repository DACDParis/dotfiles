Feb 23 01:27:05 <ziper2>	hi
Feb 23 01:27:15 <ziper2>	is this the beer channel or the computer channel
Feb 23 01:35:40 <Al2O3>	beer
Feb 23 01:35:42 <Al2O3>	:)
Feb 23 01:36:07 <Al2O3>	the home brew channel for installations and such can be found elsehwere, someone here has a link I'm sure.
Feb 23 01:36:26 <Al2O3>	ziper2 "Discussion on the domestic production of potable liquids and related software, programming, science, law, and other silly things." <<-- topic
Feb 23 01:36:43 <ziper2>	very good
Feb 23 01:36:51 <Al2O3>	##mac or ##apple might work
Feb 23 01:36:53 <Al2O3>	not sure
Feb 23 01:37:02 <Al2O3>	if you decide to brew, and talk about it, come on back.
Feb 23 01:37:15 <ziper2>	I am here for the beer
Feb 23 01:37:16 <Al2O3>	many here also do MacOS, linux, OSX, and Apple][
Feb 23 01:37:19 <Al2O3>	oh good.
Feb 23 01:37:23 <Al2O3>	howdie!
Feb 23 01:42:55 <cirdan>	f me. was feeling pretty good today then around 3pm starting feeling really not good. now have 102°F and feel terrible
Feb 23 01:43:12 <cirdan>	can try #fink ;-)
Feb 23 01:43:27 <cirdan>	we're 22 years old now iirc
Feb 23 01:52:51 <ziper2>	I am looking for something that can be made at normal room temperatures, as I live somewhere hot. The book I have only has recipes below 70F. Will I be okay if I ferment a pale ale at 75-78f ?
Feb 23 01:53:03 <cirdan>	depends on the yeast
Feb 23 01:53:14 <ziper2>	I know lagers are out, obviously
Feb 23 01:53:19 <cirdan>	for that you need to pressure ferment or use kevik
Feb 23 01:53:29 <cirdan>	ziper2: ehh people do pressure lagars at 70
Feb 23 01:53:36 <cirdan>	maybe 65-68
Feb 23 01:53:54 <cirdan>	some kevik likes 100
Feb 23 01:55:06 <ziper2>	why does pressure fermenting change the optimal temperature?
Feb 23 01:56:43 <cirdan>	because life is complex
Feb 23 03:28:28 <NickBusey>	kveik is the simplest route for sure. makes good beer fast and hot
Feb 23 03:35:36 <Al2O3>	very hot, very fast, and also makes if done right some amazing mead

Feb 23 17:31:57 <NickBusey>	only problem with laspang souchong tea, just made some earl gray in the same tea maker into the same pot. tastes smoky hah
Feb 23 18:09:49 <Eytirth>	Ferment in fride if hot?
Feb 23 18:25:16 <NickBusey>	if fride is a typo for fridge, yes, plenty of people (including myself) use fridges with a temp controller attached for fermentation chambers

Mar 06 17:34:48 <NickBusey>	I honestly have no idea re: grain steeping, doesn't make sense to me. Isn't mashing, steeping?
Mar 06 17:35:14 <NickBusey>	The only reference I can find to steeping in homebrew articles is if you're using malt extract, and want to add some specialty grains, so in that case it's instead of mashing, which makes sense
Mar 06 17:35:16 <NickBusey>	but if you're already mashing..
Mar 06 19:03:14 <cirdan>	Some grains don’t have starch to convert so a steep would be ok, i guess
Mar 06 19:04:01 <cirdan>	Biscuit malt needs a normal/mini mash ziper2

Mar 12 20:24:53 <Eytirth>	Hi
Mar 12 22:13:26 <Al2O3>	Eytirth hello
Mar 12 22:27:05 <cirdan>	'ello
Mar 12 22:39:29 <Al2O3>	hops garden area almost uncovered now, the tiers are coming 'mush' which is the melt, and I'm excited spring is here.
Mar 12 22:39:55 <Al2O3>	Its that time of year, new life, old folks and things we are saying goodbye to, and of course the fresh air and pollin.
Mar 12 22:41:10 <cirdan>	heh
Mar 12 22:43:10 <Al2O3>	sadly as well, one of the 11 tubes we have (greenhouses) is destroyed from a wind storm yesterday.
Mar 12 22:43:12 <Al2O3>	https://iili.io/JWlEFTB.jpg
Mar 12 22:43:25 <cirdan>	yeah that was some crazy wind the last 2 days
Mar 12 22:46:16 <Al2O3>	the good news it is used about 2 months from now to finish season, so getting a replacement in place may happen this year before needed, or we'll do that tube's pots outside instead this year.
Mar 13 00:07:13 <Eytirth>	Al2O3, Do you need a soild greenhouse?
Mar 13 02:12:06 <Al2O3>	nope, we are going to put up another 60' x 28' replacement, but thank you.
Mar 13 02:12:11 <Al2O3>	have it ordered already.
Mar 13 02:12:40 <Al2O3>	34,000 USD, insurance should cover 60% of the cost, maybe more, and we have some funds from last year that will fill in the rest.
Mar 13 02:12:53 <Al2O3>	expected date to arrive, 30 days.
Mar 13 02:13:00 <Al2O3>	I'll be happy if it shows up 60 days.
Mar 13 02:13:01 <Al2O3>	:)
Mar 13 02:13:08 <Al2O3>	don't tell the seller, we won't either.
Mar 13 02:14:16 <Al2O3>	estimated alum scrap metal value, 200-300 dollars :)
Mar 13 02:14:45 <Al2O3>	and that is being optomistic
Mar 13 02:14:57 <Al2O3>	I see into the future, and its very very very dark.
Mar 13 02:15:04 <Al2O3>	:)
Mar 13 03:27:42 <NickBusey>	oh dang, Al2O3 that's a bummer
Mar 13 03:54:19 <Al2O3>	well, yes.   and shit happens.
Mar 13 03:55:04 <Al2O3>	that is what insurance is for, labor doing not much in the spring is for, and of course cost of doing business :)   Good news, 1/11th of volume coverage, and it will be fixed.
