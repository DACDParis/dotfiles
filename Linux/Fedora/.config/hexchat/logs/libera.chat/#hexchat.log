Feb 20 16:55:24 <Eustachy_Kapusta>	@korn3r i might be wrong but i think theme manager is windows only
Feb 20 17:07:30 <korn3r>	Eustachy_Kapusta: thats a shame. Was quite surprised to see windows-related errors when enabled option that is not marked as windows only.
Feb 20 17:11:38 <sney>	korn3r: theme manager is a .net/mono application, I'm fairly sure it will work on linuxbut it will still produce an .exe because that's just the format
Feb 20 17:12:38 <korn3r>	sney: i complains it cant find some windows stuff 
Feb 20 17:12:51 <korn3r>	i tried to build it having mono installed
Feb 20 17:13:47 <sney>	I'm not sure what it requires honestly 
Feb 20 17:14:16 <sney>	also fwiw all it does is unpack .zip archives of text color schemes, it doesn't set window decorations or anything
Feb 20 17:17:14 <korn3r>	its actually some metadata files. "error CS0006: Metadata file `WindowsBase' could not be found", also System.Data, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms
Feb 20 17:17:27 <korn3r>	but well... if its just unpacker, not a big issue probably
Feb 20 17:18:41 <korn3r>	im happy with 3.3mb portable app that i got after compiling that meson-thing :)
Feb 20 17:25:57 <korn3r>	hm... i wonder if it would build if i cut that part that compiles thememan.exe
Feb 20 17:26:20 <sney>	thememan.exe is the application, like I said it will be .exe regardless 
Feb 20 20:08:29 <JanC>	korn3r: those are missing libraries for .NET (or Mono)
Feb 20 20:11:21 <JanC>	on Debian/Ubuntu you probably need 'libmono-system-data4.0-cil', 'libmono-system-drawing4.0-cil' & 'libmono-system-windows-forms4.0-cil'
Feb 20 20:13:34 <korn3r>	that is too much for something that just unpacks skins. i already spend some time on some undescribed error that turned out to be missing perl embed or something.
Feb 20 20:14:09 <incog>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVd2TivlVxk
Feb 20 20:14:18 <korn3r>	most of dependencies tell you what this meson thingy wants, but with that "go dig logs, brah"
Feb 20 20:15:56 <JanC>	on what distro are you?
Feb 20 20:16:59 <korn3r>	Rocky Linux (main issue with totally separate rhel-Embed<something> package) and now on MX Linux (here i figured out faster that its perl-modules)
Feb 20 20:17:13 <korn3r>	perl-embed<something> *
Feb 20 20:20:14 <JanC>	the documentation says to install 'libperl-dev' (and some other packages unrelated to Perl) on Debian/Ubuntu, I wonder if that is in there...
Feb 20 20:23:27 <korn3r>	no
Feb 20 20:24:03 <korn3r>	without that module it gave me just "error" on rhel and "uncompatible perl found" on mx or something like that
Feb 20 20:25:05 <korn3r>	perl-ExtUtils-Depends on rhel it is
Feb 20 20:25:18 <korn3r>	perl-ExtUtils-Embed 
Feb 20 20:25:26 <korn3r>	sorry, copied wrong. perl-ExtUtils-Embed
Feb 20 20:27:19 <korn3r>	and it was during dependency checking, like A-ok, B-ok, C-ok, ERROR
Feb 20 20:28:34 <shuffle>	hello
Feb 20 20:53:37 <Cihan>	Joel: yea sure

Feb 21 11:44:01 <darwin>	when I type words like first, HexChat changes the first two letters' font... can you see this?
Feb 21 11:45:08 <darwin>	it changes it from monospace to some other font... is this because of some plugin language checking for the term 'fi'?
Feb 21 14:26:19 <Guest56>	HEXCHAT IS FINISHED & BANKRUPT
Feb 21 14:26:20 <Guest56>	IT'S HABBENING
Feb 21 14:31:16 <aaabbb>	bankrupt?
Feb 21 14:31:31 <korn3r>	JanC: if you are interested, on rhel-based distro error on meson setup says "ERROR: Problem encountered: perl: Failed to get cflags" if i dont have perl-ExtUtils-Embed installed (got bacj to pc with rocky only now)
Feb 21 14:35:10 <darwin>	i rsynced ~/.config/hexchat from my desktop to laptop, but now the menu fonts seem too big
Feb 21 15:07:21 <badsektor>	guys, i enabled timestamps, but now the timestamp and the nicks are jumbled into each other
Feb 21 15:08:00 <korn3r>	badsektor: make nickname filed wider
Feb 21 15:08:03 <korn3r>	with a mouse
Feb 21 15:08:08 <darwin>	you can move the line after the nickname
Feb 21 15:08:11 <JanC>	darwin: I suppose you didn't backup the old config with the "fi issue"?
Feb 21 15:08:20 <darwin>	no
Feb 21 15:08:29 <darwin>	maybe
Feb 21 15:08:48 <darwin>	but I don't think it has anything to do with configuration--didn't change
Feb 21 15:09:08 <badsektor>	korn3r, for each channel separately? i got 20 channels?
Feb 21 15:09:35 <darwin>	i see fi in a different font in your statement also
Feb 21 15:10:56 <JanC>	seems like a font issue then, but weird
Feb 21 15:13:46 <JanC>	badsektor: the text_max_indent setting would be useful too
Feb 21 15:14:40 <JanC>	also, I configured my timestamps to be in grey, so in case of overlap it looks more like they are in the background...
Feb 21 15:16:21 <JanC>	darwin: are there other combinations with that problem (e.g. "fl" or "ff"), or only "fi"?
Feb 21 15:17:15 <JanC>	also, maybe try changing the font used (which one?) & see if the problem remains then
Feb 21 15:18:26 <JanC>	darwin: also, on what OS is this?
Feb 21 15:20:13 <darwin>	just fi
Feb 21 15:20:23 <darwin>	GNU/Linux
Feb 21 15:20:40 <darwin>	actually FreeBSD UNIX
Feb 21 15:21:06 <badsektor>	JanC, thanks
Feb 21 15:21:22 <badsektor>	JanC, i access that with /set ?
Feb 21 15:24:57 <JanC>	badsektor: yes, see https://hexchat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html#list-of-settings
Feb 21 15:26:15 <JanC>	darwin: do you have a screenshot of what happens?
Feb 21 15:30:12 <JanC>	(for those who are not familiar with it: above the list of settings on that page there is also an explanation of how to use set)
Feb 21 15:33:20 <darwin>	i use default font and am not going to change it
Feb 21 15:33:53 <darwin>	i doubt I can get a screenshot as I'm doing other things and won't use this computer long
Feb 21 15:34:06 <darwin>	when you typed fl I saw it in a different font and now when I typed it
Feb 21 15:38:01 <JanC>	you can probably make a screenshot using PrtScr or Alt+PrtScr, crop out what is private if needed, & upload it to an image site (e.g. Imgur or whatever)
Feb 21 15:38:12 <JanC>	but it sounds like a ligature thing
Feb 21 15:38:29 <JanC>	probably a font that tries to do automatic ligatures
Feb 21 15:38:55 <JanC>	unless you have a script that does that
Feb 21 15:39:58 <JanC>	when a script replaces characters with ligatures but the default font doesn't support them, fontconfig will fall back to another font for them...
Feb 21 15:48:41 <darwin>	i don't have a script that does that.  It's just monospace that came with FreeBSD

Feb 21 19:43:49 <cappy>	Is there a way to quickly copy/paste a nick from the online log rather than manually enter the nick, some of which are "complex", for a reply?
Feb 21 19:44:14 <cappy>	I'm using HexChat 2.14.3
Feb 21 19:45:02 <cappy>	Right-clicking the nick gives no "copy" function.
Feb 21 19:45:25 <sney>	type the first couple letters and then press tab to autocomplete
Feb 21 19:45:54 <cappy>	sney: Thank you that works. Man, you saved me a headache!
Feb 21 19:46:09 <sney>	there are a couple options in preferences->input box to tweak this behaviour as well
Feb 21 19:46:09 <sney>	np
Feb 21 19:46:57 <cappy>	sney: See it now. Appreciate the help.
Feb 21 19:47:07 <sney>	np :)
Feb 21 20:14:55 <cappy>	If I set a client ignore-list on nick*@* for "channel", that ignores the nick for all channels. Is there a way to ignore the nick for a specified channel?
Feb 21 20:15:23 <cappy>	The client is HexChat 2.14.3
Feb 21 20:16:37 <cappy>	The only setting I see is in Window->Ignore List->Channel
Feb 21 20:17:17 <sney>	not by default, there might be some addon that handles ignores in a more granular way 
Feb 21 20:19:26 <cappy>	sney: I'll look through https://github.com/TingPing/plugins/tree/master/HexChat for starters. Tks.

Feb 21 20:49:39 <cappy>	It's possible that this construct might work (got it from a WeeChatter): nick*!*@* libera #foochannel
Feb 21 21:04:42 <JanC>	cappy: also, Shift+Ctrl+C copies selected text (might be useful when you want to copy something other than a nickname)
Feb 21 21:06:22 <cappy>	JanC: Yeah, question already asked and found out that just dragging the mouse across text auto-copies; convenient.
Feb 21 21:06:41 <JanC>	well, that depends on a setting
Feb 21 21:07:16 <sney>	get to learn about the 2 different clipboards too :D
Feb 21 21:08:30 <JanC>	sney: it doesn't use 2 different clipboards correctly unfortunately
Feb 21 21:08:31 <cappy>	JanC: Hmm, that I didn't know. I've only been using IRC w/ HexChat for a few weeks, like the client, look great, then I read it's being dropped.
Feb 21 21:11:32 <cappy>	Built a nicely robust script to review the HexChat logs, picking out conversations, past days, etc., so I've already invested time in the client. Would hate to see it go dormant.
Feb 21 21:12:04 <JanC>	it's been mostly dormant for a couple years already
Feb 21 21:12:20 <sney>	if you're using it in linux with normal pixel density there's no reason you can't keep doing that for quite a while longer 
Feb 21 21:12:48 <cappy>	sney: Yes and yes.
Feb 21 21:13:58 <sney>	I have no plans to switch to anything else either

Feb 22 01:22:14 <aqsd>	"Ditto", says a member of the peanut gallery.  All in all not much has actually changed, which is nice because it means not much has actually changed.
Feb 22 03:25:15 <darwin>	capacitor popped off my system-/logic-/main-/mother-board :(
Feb 22 03:26:21 <darwin>	never mind that.  What about the font size or changing issue?  I don't have a screenshot program for XFCE FreeBSD (don't know what package it's in) but I think I described these enough
Feb 22 03:33:40 <pj>	depending on the capacitor and what it's for loosing one actually may not have much or any effect on the operation of the board.
Feb 22 06:05:28 <JanC>	darwin: https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/tree/x11/xfce4-screenshooter-plugin ?
Feb 22 06:12:50 <darwin>	i want a normal program, not plugin
Feb 22 06:14:40 <JanC>	it is a normal program
Feb 22 06:14:45 <JanC>	(too)
Feb 22 06:23:00 <JanC>	FWIW: in most linux distros and on the XFCE website it's called xfce4-screenshooter
Feb 22 06:40:52 <incog>	💩
Feb 22 06:51:28 <darwin>	i guess you mean GNU distros, which I'm not using
Feb 22 07:02:42 <JanC>	I mean linux distros (not all of them are GNU-based)
Feb 22 07:03:08 <darwin>	the Linux kernel itself is GNU GPL
Feb 22 07:03:22 <JanC>	but what I meant to say is that the FreeBSD naming of that package is unusual
Feb 22 07:03:33 <JanC>	that doesn't make it "GNU"

Feb 22 09:26:46 <skydrome>	use underline code at the end instead of reset

Feb 22 21:28:54 <JanC>	sney: I think this is related to that Russian HexChat fork (they renamed it to RubIRC or something like that, but apparently forgot to change the default/support channel name)
Feb 22 21:30:47 <sney>	yeah, that default being compiled in was a big problem for oftc #debian for years too 
Feb 22 21:31:09 <JanC>	oh?
Feb 22 21:32:01 <sney>	xchat on ubuntu pointed to there, and then when I fixed it with the first hexchat upload, every non-ubuntu debian derivative pointed there as well 
Feb 22 21:32:28 <incog>	just make the default efnet we'll play with them
Feb 22 21:33:51 <korn3r>	i wonder what exactly that RubIRC has different from the original Hexchat :)
Feb 22 21:34:28 <sney>	probably just default dark mode or something 
Feb 22 21:35:36 <JanC>	based on the screenshot it seems like they changed the default server list
Feb 22 21:35:50 <sney>	impressive that they still connect here, then 
Feb 22 21:36:29 <JanC>	also, the source is available as a .tar.xz
Feb 22 21:36:42 <incog>	it looks like this http://global.net.ru/rubirc/win/win-1.png
Feb 22 21:36:59 <incog>	so just like hexchat
Feb 22 21:37:09 <sney>	I don't read cyrillic but what I can see doesn't look any different 
Feb 22 21:38:07 <incog>	i would die to see an irc client specifically made for the art scene, we like to pump ascii scrolls on efnet
Feb 22 21:38:21 <incog>	and well, hexchat cant pump, no nice /play function
Feb 22 21:38:34 <incog>	so you gotta grab irssi or pirate mirc
Feb 22 21:38:36 <JanC>	the server list seems to have names like "International" & "Portuguese" & such instead of the networks
Feb 22 21:39:33 <sney>	incog: have you checked for a script with a different name that does a similar job as /play ? someone in here mentioned something like that a few days ago 
Feb 22 21:39:55 <incog>	https://mircart.org/ you all missing out, thinkin its just spam
Feb 22 21:40:03 <JanC>	I remember something like that, but don't remember the details
Feb 22 21:40:39 <JanC>	probably saw it when looking through someone's hexchat scripts repo  :)
Feb 22 21:40:47 <JanC>	or maybe xchat even
Feb 22 21:41:19 <sney>	incog: I don't know where you get the idea that people in this channel are "against" something just because hexchat doesn't have this function built in
Feb 22 21:41:34 <sney>	nobody here made that decision, and hexchat is popular because it supports loads of addons. do the math.
Feb 22 21:41:57 <incog>	nah libera is just like freenode in that respect, ascii art is seen as spam
Feb 22 21:42:09 <JanC>	it depends on the channel
Feb 22 21:42:19 <sney>	?? nobody in this channel makes those decisions for libera either 
Feb 22 21:42:35 <sney>	I'm on a private network that used to have weekly flood fridays lol
Feb 22 21:42:35 <incog>	im talking as a culture sney not individuals
Feb 22 21:42:45 <JanC>	if you want to start ##incogsasciiart please do  :)
Feb 22 21:44:15 <JanC>	there already also are channels where it is *encouraged* to spam what music you are listening to for example, even if most other channels don't like that
Feb 22 21:50:23 <JanC>	hm, seems like it shouldn't auto-join this channel...
Feb 22 21:51:58 <sney>	it probably has the joind.c default that suggests it when you connect to libera 
Feb 22 21:52:05 <JanC>	it auto-joins #rubirc now
Feb 22 21:52:17 <sney>	there's no "auto join" but it only requires pressing enter on a dialog without reading it 
Feb 22 21:52:18 <JanC>	but maybe an earlier version didn't
Feb 22 21:52:35 <sney>	https://github.com/hexchat/hexchat/blob/master/src/fe-gtk/joind.c#L250
Feb 22 21:53:20 <JanC>	it says « gtk_entry_set_text (GTK_ENTRY (entry1), "#rubirc"); » now
Feb 22 21:54:18 <sney>	well, hopefully that change proliferates 
Feb 22 21:56:54 <korn3r>	JanC: looks like some student project. also guy release 2.16.3 version on 1st january.
Feb 22 21:57:37 <JanC>	korn3r: on February 11th
Feb 22 21:57:56 <JanC>	don't trust the times in the archive
Feb 22 21:59:15 <korn3r>	JanC: VK.com page of this thing has rubirc-2.16.3-1-rosa2021.1.x86_64.rpm posted a 1th of january )
Feb 22 21:59:57 <korn3r>	2.16.3-2 on 8th january and so on.. probably he just added +2 to original build
Feb 22 22:00:04 <JanC>	so do the internal date/time inside the archive, but Apache directories say differently  :)
Feb 22 22:00:14 <JanC>	oh
Feb 22 22:01:35 <JanC>	right, first influx of Russians with RubIRC was on January 1st indeed
Feb 22 22:02:56 <korn3r>	well.. there is not much russians, that VK.com community have only one member (developer). and almost no other mentiones over the internet
Feb 22 22:03:44 <JanC>	probably school friends  :)
Feb 22 23:33:52 <DasBrain^Hex>	/set net_throttle off
Feb 22 23:34:24 <DasBrain^Hex>	And /play is a 4 line script.
Feb 22 23:35:12 <JanC>	a bit more than that I'm sure
Feb 22 23:36:10 <JanC>	you don't want to block everything while posting 1 line per second from a 50-line file   :)
Feb 22 23:40:43 <DasBrain^Hex>	/play has a delay? I thought it just dumps a text file into the channel. Until you are disconnected for MaxQ exceeded.
Feb 22 23:41:17 <sney>	aiui it is a bit more involved than just /exec -o cat homeanusbleach.txt 
Feb 22 23:41:50 <sney>	yeah, this has a whole bunch of switches and options https://www.mirc.com/help/html/index.html?playing_files.html
Feb 22 23:43:46 <JanC>	I thought the example given a couple days ago involved a delay between lines?  I might be wrong though...
Feb 22 23:44:05 <DasBrain^Hex>	"If you have flood protection turned on, /play sends all lines through the flood protection feature to prevent you from flooding yourself off the server."
Feb 22 23:44:39 <JanC>	"""This plays the file poem.txt to the current window, which must be a query or channel window, with a default delay of 1000 milliseconds, ie. 1 second. """
Feb 22 23:45:03 <JanC>	so 1sec is the default, it seems
Feb 22 23:45:30 <JanC>	maybe with flood protection on there is no such delay?
Feb 22 23:46:02 <JanC>	it's not exactly clear from that documentation  :)
Feb 22 23:53:26 <sney>	1sec between lines is a great way to get your art interrupted with a lot of (✂ﾟ∀ﾟ)✂ CUTTO
Feb 22 23:57:36 <incog>	<DasBrain^Hex> /play has a delay?
Feb 22 23:57:41 <incog>	it has a delay you can config
Feb 22 23:57:53 <incog>	to get around sill flood protection serverside
Feb 22 23:58:01 <incog>	or so u dont sendq
Feb 23 00:13:36 <nightfrog>	This is still being typed about?
Feb 23 00:26:48 <incog>	as it should be
Feb 23 00:27:43 <incog>	right now i have a much weirder problem however, do you see these rainbow bands on my latest art? https://pastebin.com/raw/eYYYrT1K
Feb 23 00:27:57 <incog>	they shouldnt be there, its like bizarre bleed-thru
Feb 23 00:28:09 <incog>	i have no idea how to mitigate it
Feb 23 00:28:29 <Tum>	it's due to subpixel rendering 
Feb 23 00:28:39 <Tum>	or scaling 
Feb 23 00:29:15 <Tum>	you can use subpixels to render greyscale content resulting in sharper lines since each pixel is actually 3 pixels, one for each color 
Feb 23 00:29:22 <Tum>	depends on the software displaying it though
Feb 23 00:29:31 <incog>	irc clients
Feb 23 00:30:13 <Tum>	Depends on the platform then. macOS does not use subpixel rendering but Windows does, and most Linux distros do.
Feb 23 00:30:47 <Tum>	in all cases it can be disabled if need be but keep in mind most people will see it WITH subpixel rendering, since it's still default on Windows
Feb 23 00:31:13 <Tum>	If you screenshot some text on Windows and zoom into it, you will see red and blue on the edges of the text
Feb 23 00:31:29 <Tum>	when displayed at 1x you won't normally see the colors, it just looks like crisper text rendering
Feb 23 00:32:14 <Tum>	HexChat uses GTK so it depends how your GTK is configured also
Feb 23 00:37:16 <JanC>	just don't use subpixel rendering, it's broken by design
Feb 23 00:38:23 <JanC>	I've never used that because when it's enabled I see colour fringes on all text, which gives me a headache...
Feb 23 00:41:13 <JanC>	Tum: unfortunately some people (like me) *do* see those colour fringes
Feb 23 00:41:34 <JanC>	it really sucks when I have to use someone else's computer...
Feb 23 00:42:09 <Tum>	JanC, I see them on glossy displays, so I do not use glossy displays
Feb 23 00:42:29 <Tum>	just thinkpads and business monitors for me plz
Feb 23 00:42:34 <Tum>	gloss is the devil
Feb 23 00:42:48 <Tum>	I quite like subpixel rendering on matte displays
Feb 23 00:43:14 <JanC>	I've never had any glossy displays (those come with even more headaches like turning into a mirror under the wrong lighting) & still see them
Feb 23 00:44:10 <Tum>	aww, sad
Feb 23 00:46:15 <JanC>	it's no problem most of the time (I have grayscale rendering enabled instead on all systems I use frequently)
Feb 23 00:46:50 <JanC>	and for 5 minutes on someone else's computer it's just annoying/distracting
Feb 23 00:47:58 <JanC>	I think most linux DEs/OSs are planning to switch to grayscale by default too, or already did
Feb 23 00:48:26 <JanC>	dunno about Windows, but I barely ever use that anyway  :)
Feb 23 03:59:35 <jwang>	Hello, i am new to this chat. 
Feb 23 04:13:32 <pabs3>	welcome jwang :)
Feb 23 04:14:57 <pabs3>	this chat channel is for the HexChat IRC program. there are other channels on this IRC server, mostly for other open source programs

Feb 23 23:01:21 <JanC>	it was failing because they were missing dependencies
Feb 23 23:01:42 <JanC>	the error message was quite obvious
Feb 23 23:02:57 <JanC>	unlikely to happen on Windows as .NET would always include everyrhing & the kitchen sink, while Debian & co. have libraries for web development, GUI development, networking, etc. etc. packaged separately
Feb 23 23:03:15 <JanC>	for Mono
Feb 23 23:06:26 <JanC>	MiloTilo: what do you mean by "three separate theme managers"?  there is only one...
Feb 23 23:08:02 <MiloTilo>	JanC, well that's not the case for me
Feb 23 23:08:31 <MiloTilo>	three of them, all in different directories
Feb 23 23:10:44 <JanC>	there might be build artifacts (parts of HTM that are later assembled) maybe?
Feb 23 23:11:21 <JanC>	assembled = linked or whatever .NET calls it  :)
Feb 23 23:13:38 <JanC>	well, I guess in theory it's possible that Mono creates multiple builds (with & without debug symbols or whatever)
Feb 23 23:15:44 <JanC>	or optimised builds (to machine code, like what Android does when you install some apps)

Feb 24 17:17:39 <DasBrain^Hex>	To be fair, many of them are away.
Feb 24 17:18:57 <sney>	most of the people who do that are clicking a thing labeled "chat" that they've never seen before 
Feb 24 17:19:18 <sney>	they don't know irc or where to look in the gui to know that anyone is here, they just know nobody else is saying anything 
Feb 24 17:19:27 <sney>	and then they close it before they can find out otherwise lol
Feb 24 17:20:20 <DasBrain^Hex>	Well, 157 nicks in the list are not away, while 84 are.

Feb 24 17:34:58 <JanC>	hehe
Feb 24 17:36:42 <DasBrain^Hex>	I have the aliases AAWAY (ALLSERV AWAY &2) and ABACK (ALLSERV BACK).
Feb 24 17:36:43 <JanC>	some clients make it more obvious than others (e.g. multi-protocol IM clients tend to link it to their common status selection widget)

Feb 25 03:47:51 <nightfrog>	Sorry for the disruption. Wasn't intended for here.
Feb 25 03:51:29 <JanC>	that seemed obvious, unless you were proposing to rewrite HexChat in assembly or something  :)

Feb 25 04:49:41 <MetaNova>	Boredasfdude: how do you like ProtonVPN?
Feb 25 04:49:53 <Boredasfdude>	its iight but not all that
Feb 25 04:50:54 <Boredasfdude>	proton though is quick back vpn though that i use
Feb 25 04:50:58 <Boredasfdude>	for like gaming
Feb 25 04:52:08 <Boredasfdude>	I mean is a quick connect back up vpn i use for fun gaming
Feb 25 04:52:16 <MetaNova>	I've not tried gaming through my VPN, but I can confirm that I experience full bandwidth (500/500Mbps) through it
Feb 25 04:53:02 <Boredasfdude>	yes the speed is great
Feb 25 04:53:18 <MetaNova>	the only reason I don't keep it on all the time is to avoid an endless gallery of CAPTCHAS
Feb 25 04:53:37 <MetaNova>	I don't use Proton, which is why I was curious
Feb 25 04:54:30 <Boredasfdude>	I mean thats what comes with security at some point right
Feb 25 04:54:47 <MetaNova>	the greater the security the greater the inconvenience, yes
Feb 25 04:54:54 <MetaNova>	it does seem so sometimes
Feb 25 04:55:34 <Boredasfdude>	what games do you play if you dont mind me asking
Feb 25 04:55:47 <MetaNova>	I don't really play games any longer
Feb 25 04:55:56 <MetaNova>	which is the leading reason why I haven't tried gaming through my VPN :P
Feb 25 04:56:31 <Boredasfdude>	i been thinking about live streaming on cod mobile but also want to make a video to though soo i do not know
Feb 25 04:56:53 <Boredasfdude>	what made you quit
Feb 25 04:57:15 <Boredasfdude>	or just taking a break from it
Feb 25 04:58:01 <MetaNova>	I was able to achieve satisfactory downtime with less-involved activities
Feb 25 04:58:28 <MetaNova>	energy and interest become resources you have to allocate, and gaming was too high a cost
Feb 25 04:58:51 <Boredasfdude>	ok gotch you, so like meditation and spiritual kind of stuff
Feb 25 04:59:07 <MetaNova>	that and my crippling youtube addiction :P
Feb 25 04:59:26 <MetaNova>	I unfortunately discovered there is an _endless_ amount of stuff I'm interested in
Feb 25 04:59:33 <MetaNova>	and how to find it
Feb 25 04:59:45 <MetaNova>	(I'm its slave, help me)
Feb 25 05:00:12 <Boredasfdude>	I agree technology takes alot of energy, I also do not spend as much time on these thing anymore
Feb 25 05:00:28 <MetaNova>	what was/were the last game(s) you played?
Feb 25 05:00:30 <Boredasfdude>	only as a side thing now
Feb 25 05:00:38 <MetaNova>	because I basically played nothing after HL2
Feb 25 05:01:16 <Boredasfdude>	but yeah that is awesome that you was able to channel that into something more fitting and productive
Feb 25 05:01:29 <MetaNova>	>productive
Feb 25 05:01:33 <Boredasfdude>	ahh yes the good days
Feb 25 05:01:37 <MetaNova>	you flatter me
Feb 25 05:02:11 <MetaNova>	I'm simply squeezing the same amount of pointless distraction with less effort
Feb 25 05:02:16 <MetaNova>	maximizing the laziness
Feb 25 05:02:31 <Boredasfdude>	how long you been into LOA
Feb 25 05:02:47 <MetaNova>	sorry, LOA?
Feb 25 05:02:57 <Boredasfdude>	Law of Attraction
Feb 25 05:03:06 <MetaNova>	I'm unfamiliar with this

Feb 25 05:04:21 <MetaNova>	so basically a rebranding of "perception is reality"

Mar 01 02:45:59 <warsoul>	hello
Mar 01 02:46:18 <warsoul>	i change all my colors in settings-preference-colors
Mar 01 02:46:58 <warsoul>	for some reason the text on channels, timestamp, the writting box are still in dark gray and i dont have nothing dark gray
Mar 01 02:54:58 <pabs3>	warsoul: hmm, changing the colours works fine for me. does it work if you restart hexchat?
Mar 01 02:58:59 <warsoul>	pabs3 no i have done everything
Mar 01 02:59:05 <warsoul>	will still keep this colors
Mar 01 02:59:13 <warsoul>	i change my background to black
Mar 01 02:59:19 <pabs3>	is this on Windows or Linux?
Mar 01 02:59:27 <warsoul>	and letters keep staying dark gray
Mar 01 02:59:29 <warsoul>	unix
Mar 01 02:59:30 <warsoul>	freebsd
Mar 01 03:00:50 <pabs3>	hmm. can you try with a new user account or try when you set your HOME environment variable to an empty directory?
Mar 01 03:02:22 <pabs3>	and which version of hexchat are you using? from FreeBSD or self-built?
Mar 01 03:04:00 <warsoul>	HexChat 2.16.2
Mar 01 03:04:21 <warsoul>	i think it is freebsd
Mar 01 03:07:32 <warsoul>	is weird
Mar 01 03:07:42 <warsoul>	it should be change once i change it in preferences
Mar 01 03:15:23 <pabs3>	definitely weird
Mar 01 03:16:13 <pabs3>	maybe try in a Linux live image on the same machine to start with, confirm that it works somewhere for you at least
Mar 01 03:17:26 <JanC>	you have to look up in Text Events what colours are used for that particular type of text
Mar 01 03:17:46 <JanC>	or just use (or at least start from) an existing theme
Mar 01 03:18:41 <JanC>	like I explained 5 days ago...
Mar 01 03:23:11 <warsoul>	JanC i have change this colors before in another OS like debian etc...
Mar 01 03:23:15 <warsoul>	never seen this before
Mar 01 03:30:59 <pabs3>	it works for me in prefs without changing the text events
Mar 01 03:36:43 <warsoul>	JanC can you explain again how to load the theme please?
Mar 01 03:37:46 <JanC>	pabs3: but in the Text Events you can see what colour is used, and thus which one to replace
Mar 01 03:39:57 <pabs3>	hmm, ok
Mar 01 03:41:05 <JanC>	warsoul: https://hexchat.github.io/themes.html & https://hexchat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appearance.html#theme-files
Mar 01 03:43:18 <JanC>	e.g. the example I gave last time, for me the "Your Message" template is "%C20%H<%H$4$1%H>%H%O%C30$t$2%O"
Mar 01 03:43:49 <JanC>	there colour #20 is used for my nick, and colour #30 for the rest of the line
Mar 01 03:43:59 <warsoul>	theme worked
Mar 01 03:45:42 <warsoul>	thanks JanC
Mar 01 03:46:14 <JanC>	BTW: if you have a HexChat configuration that works well on any of your computers, you can just copy it over to another one, and it will work the same there...
Mar 01 03:46:29 <warsoul>	i thought about that
Mar 01 04:01:44 <pabs3>	foo
Mar 01 04:02:04 <pabs3>	hmm, '/doat #foo say bar' does not add to the up-arrow message history
Mar 01 04:10:19 <JanC>	it adds the whole line to where you entered it I presume
Mar 01 04:10:52 <pabs3>	yep
Mar 01 04:10:56 <JanC>	but not '/say bar' to #foo?
Mar 01 04:11:03 <JanC>	probably for the best?
Mar 01 04:11:06 <pabs3>	right
Mar 01 04:11:47 *	pabs3 not sure
Mar 01 04:12:01 *	pabs3 kind of thinking having both would be best
Mar 01 04:13:39 <JanC>	it could be used in a script or from a keyboard shortcut or as part of a /timer command, etc., and do you really want it added to your history in all of those cases?
Mar 01 04:13:59 <pabs3>	guessing no
Mar 01 04:53:47 <ParkerMa>	Hello
Mar 01 04:54:17 <korn3r>	hi
Mar 01 04:55:55 <ParkerMa>	How are you korn3r?
Mar 01 04:56:04 <korn3r>	Fine, thank you
Mar 01 04:56:22 <korn3r>	ParkerMa: and how are you? 
Mar 01 04:57:42 <ParkerMa>	Fine. This weather. I am just waiting for Spring to get here.
Mar 01 04:58:17 <korn3r>	Spring is inevitable :)
Mar 01 04:58:39 <ParkerMa>	I am actually impressed. This is the first time successfully talking on an IRC. Most that I visit are dormant.
Mar 01 04:59:46 <korn3r>	check channel list for more chatty channels, this one is about irc client and there are channels with 1k+ users
Mar 01 05:00:05 <ParkerMa>	Wow, thank you!

Mar 01 13:07:10 <tripstah>	zeamp: someone will probably take the project i think

Mar 01 19:08:28 <DasBrain^Hex>	Well, I did update/rewrite the Tcl plugin. Mostly for personal use, but it is on Github: https://github.com/DasBrain/hexchat-addons/tree/master/c/tcl
Mar 01 19:09:58 <DasBrain^Hex>	The good news: It works with 64-bit. Before, it would just crash on windows. (pointers were cast to int, which is 32-bit on win64)
Mar 01 19:10:16 <DasBrain^Hex>	The bad news: It breaks all existing Tcl scripts.
Mar 01 19:10:54 <DasBrain^Hex>	(Because the new API is closer to the plugin API.)
Mar 01 19:12:47 <JanC>	how bad is the breakage though?
Mar 01 19:13:14 <DasBrain^Hex>	New API.
Mar 01 19:14:38 <DasBrain^Hex>	I think I wrote some compat script, which provides the old API: https://github.com/DasBrain/hexchat-addons/blob/master/c/tcl/compat.tcl - but no idea how complete it is.
Mar 01 19:14:43 <DasBrain^Hex>	I forgot.
Mar 01 19:15:00 <JanC>	that sounds like it would be useful
Mar 01 19:15:21 <JanC>	even when it's not complete, it would mean less changes are needed
Mar 01 19:16:21 <JanC>	and maybe it can be improved

Mar 02 08:56:53 <Jaxx>	There isnt any new forked version of hexchat that is from either at the end of 2023 or beginning of 2024 or something,like something new and fully finished? one for windows 10 home 64bit (installer .exe)
Mar 02 09:00:35 <korn3r>	Jaxx: official website has hexchat  version 2.16.2 from 2024
Mar 02 09:01:25 <Jaxx>	i know,but i dont use a irc client that has last update based on the news.. thats y im thinking of a forked version.. one that still being developed
Mar 02 09:07:45 <gothkat>	It’s not even a month old. Sheesh. 
Mar 02 09:09:31 <Jaxx>	I know. but remember,he has been doing this if im not wrong since 2009
Mar 02 09:11:04 <gothkat>	If you find a fork that is doing something better, by all means, go for it. But short of hiring someone, you’re not getting hourly builds here. 
Mar 02 09:11:35 <Jaxx>	i understand. i hope it continues,because its really good client
Mar 02 09:12:09 <korn3r>	why would you prefer frequently updated client over good client?
Mar 02 09:23:01 <Jaxx>	dont u think sooner or later any programme or even a irc client can get bad if its not getting updated. cuz u never know if it have bugs etc. and nobody will use a buggy client..
Mar 02 09:32:33 <gothkat>	When/if something better appears, I’ll switch. Whether anyone is actively planning on making changes makes zero difference to how it performs today and tomorrow. 
Mar 02 09:36:04 <DasBrain^Hex>	Correct. The only thing this means for me now is: There will be no new features.
Mar 02 09:37:32 <DasBrain^Hex>	And if some exploit/crash or other stuff is found, maybe someone will step up and fix it. Maybe I am the person who will fix it (mostly for myself, and then figure out how to distribute the fix - not looking forward to that)
Mar 02 09:38:14 <DasBrain^Hex>	But currently - I do not see a need to change anything for myself, so... why bother.
Mar 02 09:38:47 <Jaxx>	i just switched until further notice
Mar 02 09:40:47 <gothkat>	You do you Jaxx, but if HexChat was the best client for your needs last month, it still is today and still will be tomorrow too. 
Mar 02 09:41:43 <Jaxx>	yeah :)

Mar 06 16:54:42 <Oneman>	hi
Mar 06 16:56:52 <Oneman>	have anyone here?
Mar 06 16:57:01 <sney>	hi
Mar 06 16:57:07 <Oneman>	ok thanks
Mar 06 16:57:14 <Oneman>	i have a question
Mar 06 16:57:19 <Oneman>	can u help?
Mar 06 16:57:41 <sney>	is your question about hexchat? 
Mar 06 16:57:53 <Oneman>	no
Mar 06 16:58:20 <sney>	then there is probably a better channel for you. most distros have their own channels, so for instance if you are looking for arch support, you would /join #archlinux and then ask there 
Mar 06 16:59:38 <Oneman>	looking for Avista tracker channel
Mar 06 16:59:41 <Oneman>	can u help?
Mar 06 17:00:12 <sney>	this network has a bot that can search for channels, use it like /msg alis list keyword
Mar 06 17:00:30 <Oneman>	ok
Mar 06 17:00:33 <Oneman>	i founded
Mar 06 17:00:40 <Oneman>	thanks you !

Mar 06 22:01:54 <slidercrank>	hello
Mar 06 22:02:38 <slidercrank>	Linux Mint developers announced they would be developing a replacement for now abandoned HexChat.  https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4650
Mar 06 22:02:45 <slidercrank>	https://github.com/linuxmint/jargonaut
Mar 06 22:02:59 <slidercrank>	but they don't call it an IRC client
Mar 06 22:03:29 <slidercrank>	still it looks like it would be possible to connect to IRC servers (at least I hope so)
Mar 06 22:04:15 <bfu>	maybe give this a try https://xchat.servx.org/linux/x86_64/
Mar 06 22:11:59 <DasBrain_Hex>	Not sure what to think about Jargonaut. I see it as "You need help? Just start Jargonaut and ask. No configuration/setup needed."
Mar 06 22:13:18 <DasBrain_Hex>	I think it could be great for newcomers to introduce to IRC. But then... Maybe it needs some "expert mode".
Mar 06 22:21:56 <JanC>	bfu: why would people install/use random stuff from the internet like that...?
Mar 06 22:23:07 <bfu>	curiosity?:)
Mar 06 22:24:03 <PantelicGR>	slidercrank: >Although it uses the IRC, it won’t be developed as an IRC client. It will support pastebin/imgur via DND, uploading your system specifications, troubleshooting and many features which have nothing to do with IRC. Yet you won’t be able to join channels or perform common IRC commands... Jargonaut is an XAPP... <-- It's not an IRC client. It's just another chat app.
Mar 06 22:24:37 <PantelicGR>	Thanks for sharing though.
Mar 06 22:24:38 <JanC>	bfu: so where is the source code?  I'm pretty sure it's plain illegal what they do on that site...
Mar 06 22:26:52 <JanC>	WTF is a "XAPP" (in this context)?
Mar 06 22:27:14 <bfu>	is that illegal to not disclose your src?
Mar 06 22:28:20 <JanC>	bfu: XChat/HexChat are GPL, so yes it's illegal (unless you own the copyright on everything yourself)
Mar 06 22:29:16 <JanC>	or have a different license from all copyright owners
Mar 06 22:29:41 <bfu>	oh well, then it is i suppose
Mar 06 22:30:16 <bfu>	too bad, as it is still maintained.. pity its not open
Mar 06 22:30:43 <JanC>	seems like it's mostly Windows-only also
Mar 06 22:30:55 <PantelicGR>	JanC: As for XAPP I'm reading a wikipedia article but I don't know if it's related: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XApps
Mar 06 22:30:59 <JanC>	except for the "experimental linuxpackages"
Mar 06 22:32:28 <JanC>	PantelicGR: I'm sure it's not, and it's just one of many things called "xapp" or some variation of it, which is why I have no idea what they mean  :)
Mar 06 22:32:44 <PantelicGR>	OK.
Mar 06 22:32:58 <JanC>	there is also some "AI" chatbot called XApp
Mar 06 22:33:08 <JanC>	but I assume it's not that either
Mar 06 22:33:37 <PantelicGR>	I won't use a replacement chat app instead of an IRC client.
Mar 06 22:33:53 <PantelicGR>	Yeah.
Mar 06 22:34:28 <PantelicGR>	I will keep using HexChat and maybe WeeChat in the future and see what happens.
Mar 06 22:35:31 <JanC>	there are a whole bunch of other IRC applications
Mar 06 22:35:54 <PantelicGR>	Yeah, I know. :)
Mar 06 22:36:11 <rawhide>	JanC, but no other good ones
Mar 06 22:36:15 <JanC>	for people who just need basic IRC they are probably going to be sufficient too
Mar 06 22:37:04 <JanC>	but for "IRC power users" who expect scripting it was the only one based on Gtk, I think...   :-/
Mar 06 22:37:09 <PantelicGR>	For anyone interested it has been posted here before: Comparison of Internet Relay Chat Clients: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients
Mar 06 22:37:46 <JanC>	that list is far from complete
Mar 06 22:38:13 <PantelicGR>	Do you have a better list?
Mar 06 22:38:15 <rawhide>	I've tried tons of IRC clients and HexChat is the only one I've liked
Mar 06 22:38:27 <PantelicGR>	I still like HexChat too.
Mar 06 22:39:20 <DasBrain_Hex>	I am currently in the process of switching to weechat.
Mar 06 22:47:21 <JanC>	some Gtk-based ones that aren't listed on that Wikipedia page are Srain https://srain.silverrainz.me/ & Loqui https://github.com/sunnyone/loqui (hasn't been updated in years either...) & Polari https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Polari/
Mar 06 22:49:47 <PantelicGR>	JanC: Nice. :)
Mar 06 22:50:15 <JanC>	they sometimes look nice, but...
Mar 06 22:52:32 <PantelicGR>	I will check them out.
Mar 06 22:53:47 <JanC>	and there is Smuxi, of course
Mar 06 22:54:39 <JanC>	and Pidgin & Empathy which can do basic IRC
Mar 06 22:55:25 <PantelicGR>	I know Pidgin but not the others.
Mar 06 22:56:02 <JanC>	Empathy is similar to pidgin in that it's a multi-protocol IM client
Mar 06 22:58:29 <PantelicGR>	Do you know if Srain supports DCC?
Mar 06 22:58:43 <PantelicGR>	I know that Pidgin supports it.
Mar 06 22:59:53 <JanC>	I doubt it
Mar 06 23:00:09 <PantelicGR>	Polari?
Mar 06 23:00:20 <PantelicGR>	Empathy?
Mar 06 23:00:28 <JanC>	I doubt it
Mar 06 23:00:40 <JanC>	but feel free to try  :)
Mar 06 23:01:12 <PantelicGR>	I will read info about them.
Mar 06 23:01:47 <JanC>	https://srain.silverrainz.me/support.html says DCC → No
Mar 06 23:03:01 <pj>	That sounds a lot like, "We're gonna jump the gun on burying hexchat, I know, let's just have an AI write us some random chat app and we'll call it a replacement."
Mar 06 23:03:36 <JanC>	Srain has been around for a while, their focus is just on other things
Mar 06 23:04:24 <JanC>	for many here, I suspect the main issue would be the lack of plugin/scripting support
Mar 06 23:05:32 <JanC>	that and stuff like wasting space on screen that you really need when you are in >100 channels  :)
Mar 06 23:05:41 <pj>	I've never cared for clients that tack on IRC support to other things.  If I wanted that there's already a number of "hexchat replacements" available.
Mar 06 23:07:44 <PantelicGR>	So Srain isn't an option for me.
Mar 06 23:09:45 <PantelicGR>	JanC: Does Polari support Windows?
Mar 06 23:10:21 <PantelicGR>	It says: "Polari is a simple Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client that is designed to
Mar 06 23:10:21 <PantelicGR>	integrate seamlessly with the GNOME desktop."
Mar 06 23:10:32 <JanC>	I have no idea, but considering it's a Gnome project, I doubt that's a priority
Mar 06 23:22:37 <PantelicGR>	All these IRC clients except Pidgin seem not to support DCC.

Mar 07 02:24:39 <JanC>	cappy: any halfway decent editor will handle indents for you, so it's really not an issue...
Mar 07 02:25:55 <cappy>	JanC: I use PyCharm, so yeah. It's more the principle of the thing.
Mar 07 02:25:56 <JanC>	and it's rarely a good idea to have code that is long & deeply nested
Mar 07 02:27:04 <cappy>	JanC: You've not come from the F77 days ;-)  Of course, we don't do that anymore.
Mar 07 02:27:33 <JanC>	the fact that such code exists does not mean it is or was a good idea  :)
Mar 07 02:28:06 <JanC>	and tehre will always be exceptions, I guess
Mar 07 02:28:30 <cappy>	Back then, it was /the only/ idea. But this is now... and we do things /differently/.
Mar 07 02:28:40 <JanC>	but often it would be a lot easier to read & understand the code when it's split up
Mar 07 02:29:31 <cappy>	Agree totally. It's just that I prefer languages that ignore whitespace and block code visibly.
Mar 07 02:29:53 <JanC>	indentation is visible  :)
Mar 07 02:30:39 <cappy>	Not to me. I don't see ghosts :0
Mar 07 02:30:52 <JanC>	and it's easy to make things impossible to understand if you don't indent properly with {} blocks
Mar 07 02:32:39 <JanC>	and if you really care, you can always use #{ and #} instead of { and } in Python   ;)
Mar 07 02:32:46 <cappy>	Always do, and I think it's a thing of beauty. I have, however worked with one guy that prided himself on obfuscating production code by removing all whitespace. He persisted because he was a "known genius" that they couldn't afford to fire.
Mar 07 02:33:18 <cappy>	JanC: Now that's an idea.
Mar 07 02:33:38 <cappy>	But I'd get laughed at, I'm certain.
Mar 07 02:34:53 <JanC>	I remember from back when I followed comp.lang.python that that was the standard reply every time some C developer came in complaining about it   ;)
Mar 07 02:35:04 <JanC>	it might even have been in the FAQ
Mar 07 02:36:03 <cappy>	See... see... C.  I be far from the only one. It's always those C-programmer guys, darn, darn.
Mar 07 02:36:39 <JanC>	well, C or some other language using {} or whatever to delimit blocks
Mar 07 02:38:08 <JanC>	cappy: did you auto-run that "genius" code through a code formatter whenever it was checked into source control?
Mar 07 02:38:18 <cappy>	It's like a book with covers: { book }
Mar 07 02:39:15 <cappy>	JanC: Oh yes we did. It was project code.
Mar 07 02:57:17 <manjaro>	hola

Mar 07 05:43:16 <pj>	I have always felt that using formatting as syntax is a terrible idea.  I am all for proper formatting of code, but relying on it for syntax is just a recipie for disaster, imo.

Mar 09 16:00:37 <kveremitz>	pastebin?
Mar 09 16:00:49 <kveremitz>	don't ask to ask :P
Mar 09 17:52:38 <sorcier>	you're right. here's a pastebin. https://pastebin.com/GG7pYj7U
Mar 09 19:28:29 <JanC>	sorcier: does it not work, or are you just asking for an opinion/review?
Mar 09 19:29:21 <sorcier>	it doesn't work
Mar 09 19:30:22 <sorcier>	it seems to load, but, upon requesting a file type that's not in the trusted list, it doesn't reject the file.
Mar 09 19:36:23 <DasBrain^Hex>	/dcc close
Mar 09 19:36:36 <JanC>	I think I see several errors already
Mar 09 19:37:03 <sorcier>	great.
Mar 09 19:39:57 <JanC>	first of all, there is no "commandf()" function in HexChat
Mar 09 19:40:39 <JanC>	at least, not in Python
Mar 09 19:42:25 <JanC>	(it exists in C, but its extra functionality of format strings is built-in in Python)
Mar 09 19:46:27 <JanC>	second, you split the filename on "."s & take the last element in the resulting list of strings; that will not include a ".", while your list of "trusted extensions" all include dots
Mar 09 19:49:57 <JanC>	I almost never use DCC, so I would have to go read the specs for that to check if you have any errors in that (but maybe DasBrain^Hex has more experience with it?)
Mar 09 19:50:01 <sorcier>	so if i just remove the . from the trusted extensions, it will just check the last 3 characters and that hypothetically will work?
Mar 09 19:50:36 <JanC>	that should fix that bug, yes
Mar 09 19:51:03 <sorcier>	i'm fairly new to programming, just trying to get this to work as hexchat doesn't have this functionality built it and there's nothing that I can use that has it(mIRC but that's Windows based)
Mar 09 19:51:08 <JanC>	and you use format strings elsewhere already, so I assume you know how to use them with command()
Mar 09 19:54:24 <sorcier>	hrm, okay, going to try to figure out a few things
Mar 09 21:15:48 <SupaGamer2017>	It's honestly sad that this has happened
Mar 09 21:18:34 <SupaGamer2017>	Does anyone know if Flatpack is the only release of Hexchat for macOS?
Mar 09 21:18:45 <SupaGamer2017>	Or is there some hidden binary that I have to traverse the web for
Mar 09 21:18:53 <SupaGamer2017>	*Flatpak
Mar 09 22:10:28 <JanC>	SupaGamer2017: I don't think there have been any releases for macOS at all for many years
Mar 09 22:59:18 <sorcier>	i'm beginning to believe it's impossible to block a file transfer merely based off it's file extension.

Mar 10 17:27:38 <arcti>	how can I dynamically add a new db to a flask-sqlalchemy instance? 
Mar 10 17:28:24 <arcti>	I'm building a tool with a plugin system and would like for plugins to be able to add db binds without having to edit the config file
Mar 10 19:48:21 <Elon_Satoshi>	So I just learned about the final release. RIP
Mar 10 22:06:17 <buf>	hi, some easy way to have some command executed on the startup?
Mar 10 22:06:46 <buf>	independent of the network connection
Mar 10 22:12:13 <JanC>	you can do that with a plugin or script
Mar 10 22:12:18 <JanC>	but why independent of network connection?
Mar 10 22:26:23 <buf>	because i only want it to run/set once, not on every reconnect
Mar 10 22:26:39 <buf>	in case of disconnects
Mar 10 22:27:57 <sney>	that would probably have to be scripted 
Mar 10 22:30:57 <buf>	i bet it was already, once upon a time :)
Mar 10 22:31:04 <buf>	but many scripts lost in time
Mar 10 22:32:46 <JanC>	there are many many many scripts still around too, just hard to find them sometimes...  ;)
Mar 10 22:33:35 <buf>	true, this is best place probably https://github.com/Poorchop/hexchat-scripts
Mar 10 22:33:49 <buf>	but i also found dead urls there already
Mar 10 22:36:47 <buf>	tab-name.pl (see remarks) - Adds channel modes and an unread messages counter to your tab names.
Mar 10 22:36:54 <buf>	i think somebody asked about this not long ago
Mar 10 22:39:14 <sney>	you can probably get those dead urls via web.archive.org 
Mar 10 22:39:36 <buf>	not if hosted on github, i tried
Mar 10 22:50:10 <JanC>	someone might have forked them, and you might be able to find a fork (but that won't be easy if the repository is just named hexchat-scripts probably...)
Mar 10 22:54:32 <buf>	maybe this http://b0at.tx0.org/xchat/addons/scripts/startup/do_startup-1.pl

Mar 11 01:02:43 <serenity_waterfa>	oops well does hexchat do log ur messages or is it completely wiped when i end my session
Mar 11 01:04:29 <sney>	depends on whether you have logging enabled. settings->preferences->logging "enable logging of conversations to disk" 
Mar 11 01:05:02 <sney>	you should always assume whatever you type on irc is being logged by someone else, though.
Mar 11 01:06:18 <serenity_waterfa>	fair. How popular is this compared to other IRCs
Mar 11 01:06:41 <serenity_waterfa>	I dont use this one normally
Mar 11 01:07:31 <sney>	I think it's pretty popular as gui clients go, it supports scripting in a few languages and there are a lot of existing scripts for it. runs on *nix and windows 
Mar 11 01:08:37 <serenity_waterfa>	Thanks this was very usefull I appreciate it
Mar 11 01:08:38 <JanC>	there is also the scrollback
Mar 11 01:08:40 <sney>	np
Mar 11 01:09:14 <JanC>	well
Mar 11 01:09:18 <sney>	lol

Mar 14 17:55:32 <vicky__>	HEY
Mar 14 21:58:36 <PeGaSuS>	hi. any idea why I'm getting "SYSINFO :Unknown command"? probably because my Python version is too high?
Mar 14 22:02:48 <PantelicGR>	PeGaSuS: In the latest HexChat version there is an update for the python plugin interface with Python 3.8 .
Mar 14 22:03:11 <PantelicGR>	What HexChat version, Python version and OS do you have?
Mar 14 22:03:15 <PeGaSuS>	I'm using the latest version, though
Mar 14 22:03:26 <PeGaSuS>	python version is Python 3.10.12
Mar 14 22:03:43 <PantelicGR>	I speak for Windows.
Mar 14 22:04:03 <PeGaSuS>	I don't use Windows
Mar 14 22:04:10 <PeGaSuS>	I'm using Ubuntu 22.04
Mar 14 22:04:31 <PantelicGR>	OK, I think you can have any Python version then with GNU-Linux.
Mar 14 22:04:53 <PantelicGR>	But wait for confirmation from others here.
Mar 14 22:05:06 <PeGaSuS>	Ubuntu 22.04 has as minimum 3.10
Mar 14 22:05:09 <PantelicGR>	As I don't have GNU/Linux at the moment.
Mar 14 22:08:14 <PeGaSuS>	I thought that Flatpak would install the Python version sandboxed. apparently it doesn't
Mar 14 22:09:07 <PantelicGR>	That means you have to manually install Python?
Mar 14 22:10:45 <PeGaSuS>	I already had Python installed. I thought that installing from Flatpak would install the required Python version. it doesn't
Mar 14 22:10:47 <PeGaSuS>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mar 14 22:11:35 <PantelicGR>	If you go from HexChat to: Window -> Plugins and Scripts ... is the Python scripting interface loaded?
Mar 14 22:12:37 <sney>	sysinfo isn't a python script last I checked 
Mar 14 22:13:09 <sney>	in debian/ubuntu etc it is in the 'hexchat-plugins' package which you might not have if you disabled recommends 
Mar 14 22:13:25 <sney>	oh, flatpak
Mar 14 22:13:31 <sney>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Mar 14 22:14:47 <PeGaSuS>	yeah. even then, I can't go lower than Python 3.10 without PPAs or something
Mar 14 22:15:04 <sney>	right, but sysinfo is not python anyway
Mar 14 22:15:19 <PeGaSuS>	oh yes, it is
Mar 14 22:15:27 <PeGaSuS>	it depends on the python interface
Mar 14 22:16:04 <PeGaSuS>	which is not present on my install since I have Python 3.10.2 and HexChat requires 3.8.<something>
Mar 14 22:16:13 <sney>	it's in C, https://github.com/hexchat/hexchat/tree/master/plugins/sysinfo I don't see any python here. 
Mar 14 22:16:58 <sney>	hexchat is not locked to a single python version either except on windows 
Mar 14 22:17:14 <PeGaSuS>	it's then why doesn't it work?
Mar 14 22:17:51 <sney>	in window->plugins and scripts, do you see an entry for Sysinfo with the file listed as "sysinfo.so"? 
Mar 14 22:18:56 <PeGaSuS>	nvm.. PEBCAK.. please remove the problem before proceeding
Mar 14 22:19:09 <sney>	what was it?
Mar 14 22:19:22 <PeGaSuS>	the issue is that I had a shortcut to run HexChat in "Safe Mode"
Mar 14 22:19:29 <sney>	aha
Mar 14 22:19:34 <PeGaSuS>	and I was using that shortcut
Mar 14 22:19:50 <PeGaSuS>	obviously nothing was loaded
Mar 14 22:19:54 <PeGaSuS>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mar 14 22:19:55 <sney>	heh :)
Mar 14 22:20:36 <PeGaSuS>	I was using it the other day to test some stuff in my network, because I have like 27 servers in autoconnect
Mar 15 00:12:39 <nomadriker>	,

Mar 15 12:02:22 <masoudd>	You want to only change the color of your own messages?
Mar 15 12:02:41 <ZAJDAN>	yes
Mar 15 12:04:46 <masoudd>	Hmm it doesn't look like it's possible without a plugin or script
Mar 15 12:05:38 <monr0e>	is there a way to start hexchat in debug mode? I'm trying to figure out why it hangs a bit on startup
Mar 15 12:06:55 <ZAJDAN>	masoudd: :( bad..when I have black bacground I do not see my messages cause they are dark grey
Mar 15 12:07:05 <masoudd>	monr0e, I don't think so. You'd have to compile in debug mode and use a debugger
Mar 15 12:07:31 <monr0e>	eugh. I have half a mind that its some libnotify thing, but I also seem to remember libnotify being removed
Mar 15 12:07:31 <masoudd>	ZAJDAN, Do you mean like this message? That is highlighted because I mentioned your nick?
Mar 15 12:08:22 <pj>	ZAJDAN: look under Settings -> Text Events -> Your Message
Mar 15 12:12:22 <ZAJDAN>	test
Mar 15 12:12:42 <masoudd>	it is like this for me: %C6<%O$1%C6>%O$t$2%O
