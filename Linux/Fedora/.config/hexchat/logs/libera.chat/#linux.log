Dec 10 08:26:21 <rascul>	i make programs that fight for the user
Dec 10 08:26:23 <rascul>	tron style
Dec 10 08:26:48 <silly>	everything that i do is just silly :/
Dec 10 08:26:53 <amirny2205>	oh, I've been there an hour before. Even after reboot, my machine freezes again. pls help. It just freezes, the video and music are playing, but I can't input anything. tty2 freezes, too
Dec 10 08:26:58 <spo0n>	I personally like the distinction being user interaction but apple really made app the default word for eveyrhing thinking rock does
Dec 10 08:26:59 <rascul>	by user i mean me because nobody else would use the garbage i make
Dec 10 08:27:15 <bluedartfrog>	so what is the difference between unix and linux? where does debian fit in?
Dec 10 08:27:51 <silly>	unix was a product of atnt iirc and linux was linus' free alternative
Dec 10 08:27:52 <luna>	GNU/Linux
Dec 10 08:28:07 <amirny2205>	oh I actually see errors in journalctl
Dec 10 08:28:08 *	BootLayer (~BootLayer@user/BootLayer) has joined
Dec 10 08:28:13 <spo0n>	unix is an old operation system. linux is an unix like operating system. debian is a distribution of linux i.e. the linux kernel, package manager and core utils
Dec 10 08:28:18 *	cahoots has quit (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
Dec 10 08:28:19 <rascul>	unix is a specification that apple pays money for; linux is a mostly unix compatible kernel and/or operating system depending on things like definitions and contexts that is mostly unix like
Dec 10 08:28:33 <Norkle>	linux is more user friendly!

Dec 10 08:29:36 <rascul>	use the users
Dec 10 08:29:43 <spo0n>	my unix like OS of choice is Guix with HURD
Dec 10 08:30:07 <rascul>	how many guix hurd systems do you have installed?

Dec 10 08:32:17 <rascul>	hurd will still be borderline abandoned in 20 years like it is now
Dec 10 08:32:17 *	Varro (~unknown@user/ednash) has joined
Dec 10 08:32:23 <silly>	i like diversity, hurd doesn't hurt
Dec 10 08:32:44 <Varro>	I have determined the problem does not occur if I disable wpa_supplicant. So it could be related to the wifi driver?
Dec 10 08:32:47 <rascul>	all four people who use it will still continue to contribute
Dec 10 08:33:15 <spo0n>	you should not have wpa_supplicant enabled with NetworkManager
Dec 10 08:33:18 *	jakebreaksit has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
Dec 10 08:33:22 <spo0n>	having both up at the same time breaks things
Dec 10 08:33:36 <Varro>	Just read that somewhere else as well
Dec 10 08:33:52 <Varro>	But the problem occurs even if I have only NetworkManager enabled
Dec 10 08:34:04 <rascul>	well networkmanager often runs wpa_supplicant
Dec 10 08:34:07 <silly>	oh i thought everything was using wpa_supplicant for wifi authentication
Dec 10 08:34:13 <rascul>	for wpa related stuff
Dec 10 08:34:23 <spo0n>	wouldn't it call it itself?
Dec 10 08:34:32 <rascul>	there aren't really many alternatives to wpa_supplicant
Dec 10 08:34:33 <Varro>	Another thing I checked, is that if I disable the WLAN from UEFI then there's no problem with reboot
Dec 10 08:34:38 <rascul>	maybe not any alternatives?
Dec 10 08:34:44 <spo0n>	instead of you launching it manually
Dec 10 08:34:55 *	ano has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Dec 10 08:35:04 <rascul>	you don't have to launch it manually if networkmanager launches it for you
Dec 10 08:35:11 <Varro>	Can I tell the kernel to handle it differently? E.g. to not try to shutdown the wifi, or not worry about graceful shutdown?
Dec 10 08:35:11 <spo0n>	that's my point
Dec 10 08:35:40 *	ano (~ano@user/ano) has joined
Dec 10 08:35:58 <rascul>	Varro if you disable wpa_supplicant does everything still work as expected?
Dec 10 08:36:00 <Varro>	you're right, when i disable wpa_supplicant, running NetworkManager activates it.
Dec 10 08:36:14 *	mattallmill has quit (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
Dec 10 08:36:19 <rascul>	or does the problem still occur?
Dec 10 08:36:27 <Varro>	rascul: no because after NetworkManger activates, wpa_supplicant status also shows active
Dec 10 08:36:31 <Varro>	still occurs
Dec 10 08:36:44 <rascul>	what is the device?
Dec 10 08:38:11 <Varro>	Probably this one in `lspci -vt`: 02.2-[03]----00.0  MEDIATEK Corp. MT7922 802.11ax PCI Express Wireless Network Adapter
Dec 10 08:38:23 <rascul>	oh mediatek garbage

Dec 10 09:07:18 <bluedartfrog>	no, ive been kinda looking for linux audio software.
Dec 10 09:07:44 <bluedartfrog>	is it for linux and made to build a music library?
Dec 10 09:08:43 <circuitbone>	https://lmms.io/
Dec 10 09:09:30 <jim>	bluedartfrog, no, multitrack audio and midi recorder/sequencer
Dec 10 09:09:40 <espresso>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/List_of_applications/Multimedia#Audio
Dec 10 09:11:04 <bluedartfrog>	apple has long claimed their proprietary compression is near "lossless" but it isn't. lossless is pretty much defined as 44.1 16 bit sampling (cd quality) but its gone way past that. 192khz 24 bit sampling is pretty much the point where there is no reason to go higher even if you spent 1 million on audio gear
Dec 10 09:11:22 <n4dir>	bluedartfrog: if you say what exactly you want to do, some might have an idea which audio software you might use in linux

Dec 10 09:11:53 <n4dir>	the arch wiki link given by espresso should suffice too, i don't know that link
Dec 10 09:12:05 <spo0n>	ALAC is definitelly lossless
Dec 10 09:12:56 <bluedartfrog>	build a music library. import from apple and microsoft and have high levels of control over the playback.
Dec 10 09:13:31 <chiselfuse>	can i run Visual Studio on linux? my uni gave me a zip that contains .sln file and i don't know how to load it
Dec 10 09:13:40 <bluedartfrog>	i hate to say it but i like the audio visualizations from back in the day. it just looks cool.
Dec 10 09:14:19 <n4dir>	doesn't audacious have such a visualization plugin?
Dec 10 09:14:26 <live1>	espresso mentioned the other day: https://cardinal.kx.studio/ , https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/ , i'm going to add https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data
Dec 10 09:14:46 <circuitbone>	machine learning compression and composition for acoustics will be unfathomable to comprehend so you might want to start making content instead of worrying about gear aquisition sydnrome
Dec 10 09:15:30 <chiselfuse>	can vscode maybe open a .sln?
Dec 10 09:16:34 <chiselfuse>	i'm doomed right
Dec 10 09:16:52 <jasassin>	does wine run visual studio?
Dec 10 09:16:57 <viper_>	I don't think vscode can do that navitvely, no.
Dec 10 09:17:38 <chiselfuse>	i looked at the tree of the zip and looks like there are a lot of .dll's and .exe's in it, would it even be possible to do anything with it under linux?
Dec 10 09:18:05 <chiselfuse>	hmm i think i could link to .so
Dec 10 09:19:44 <bluedartfrog>	i bookmarked audacious. i looks worthy of investigation. but if it doesnt support 192khz sampling its not that good.
Dec 10 09:20:19 <chiselfuse>	here's the zip btw if anyone can give me a hint https://0x0.st/H39l.zip
Dec 10 09:21:42 <viper_>	I would try downloading Visual Studio 2022 / Community and grab the .exe and throw it in Wine.
Dec 10 09:21:55 <live1>	chiselfuse: what language is it written in
Dec 10 09:22:06 <chiselfuse>	live1: cpp
Dec 10 09:22:11 <chiselfuse>	opengl/glut
Dec 10 09:22:49 <chiselfuse>	i don't understand the structure, there are function definitions .h files
Dec 10 09:23:34 <bluedartfrog>	there is actually 384khz 32bit audio but its only something a music studio would use just because they can.
Dec 10 09:24:00 <bluedartfrog>	it prob uses a 1TB for 1 song.
Dec 10 09:24:26 <live1>	chiselfuse: would it be a problem to upload the output of `tree -s projectFolder`
Dec 10 09:26:04 <chiselfuse>	live1: i uploaded the entire zip https://0x0.st/H39l.zip
Dec 10 09:26:11 <chiselfuse>	i can post tree too if you don't want that
Dec 10 09:26:15 <live1>	aha
Dec 10 09:26:26 <chiselfuse>	do you want tree only?
Dec 10 09:26:46 <bluedartfrog>	i think dolby atmos and DTS-X both support 32 different audio channels. its mostly for imax and pro theaters
Dec 10 09:26:48 <circuitbone>	neve desk to $3 headphones
Dec 10 09:26:55 <live1>	let me see the .zip
Dec 10 09:27:49 <chiselfuse>	i'm slowly correcting #includes here and there but idk if it's going anywhere
Dec 10 09:28:23 <ski>	`.sln' is apparently "Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File"
Dec 10 09:29:11 <chiselfuse>	indeed

Dec 10 09:30:15 <live1>	chiselfuse: yes please. a `tree -s projectFolder` would be more suitable for me
Dec 10 09:30:50 <bluedartfrog>	i think master audio DTS-X is better than dolby. dolby uses 1/3 the space and claims their compression is good enough that there is no loss in quality

Dec 10 09:34:39 <chiselfuse>	you can't see software

Dec 10 09:35:03 <spo0n>	https://github.com/torvalds/linux
Dec 10 09:35:05 <chiselfuse>	because software is information
Dec 10 09:35:06 <not_reserved>	bluedartfrog: you can read the kernel sources
Dec 10 09:36:24 <bluedartfrog>	how do you read the kernel sources? the "top" command seems to reveal a lot of whats happening.
Dec 10 09:36:25 <not_reserved>	or rummage around in a gui configurator to get an idea of what's all in there
Dec 10 09:36:44 <not_reserved>	top is just running processes, like task manager on windows
Dec 10 09:37:27 <live1>	here is what i see: ./Debug/ folder should be the output of the compilation, you can perhaps discard it completely. .dll files could be library dependencies (you should have them in your repository). you can discard .sln .vcxproj files too as it's IDE project files. and now you need to modify source files to be able to compile on linux. i don't know if that's too much work. chiselfuse
Dec 10 09:37:49 <chiselfuse>	i'm trying already
Dec 10 09:37:57 <chiselfuse>	by patching #include
Dec 10 09:38:10 <chiselfuse>	stuff like <gl\glut.h> to <GL/glut.h>

Dec 10 09:38:39 <luna>	ski: hm?
Dec 10 09:38:50 <bluedartfrog>	it better than task manager in windows.
Dec 10 09:38:55 <live1>	chiselfuse: the question is more suitable for ##programming or a C++ channel. alternative suggestion is to run VS Studio in a VM, if you have the hardware capabilities
Dec 10 09:39:06 <not_reserved>	bluedartfrog: ^ there's a book but i've never read it
Dec 10 09:39:11 <supakeen>	bluedartfrog: Top will show the kernel threads but those are a just a few parts of the kernel. If you're interested in how kernels themselves work it's probably easier to start with some random microkernel design or the guides from OSDev: https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page
Dec 10 09:39:17 <bluedartfrog>	it shows root and like 5000 other things bouncing around
Dec 10 09:39:24 <supakeen>	That way you'll have some idea of what problem(s) kernels solve and do.
Dec 10 09:39:35 <ski>	luna : sorry, mis-completion
Dec 10 09:39:37 <luna>	ah
Dec 10 09:39:38 <chiselfuse>	not_reserved: what kernel version is that written for?
Dec 10 09:39:39 <supakeen>	Then you can map those ideas to how the Linux kernel does things.
Dec 10 09:40:18 <not_reserved>	chiselfuse: i assume something ancient, but first principles ought to remain the same
Dec 10 09:40:55 <chiselfuse>	meh
Dec 10 09:40:58 <not_reserved>	> The book is current as of the 2.6.18 kernel release, newer kernel versions will cause some of the configuration items to move around and new configuration options will be added. However the main concepts in the book still remain for any kernel version released.
Dec 10 09:42:12 <bluedartfrog>	im pretty sure i cant design a micro kernel. if i could i would be answering you tech questions.
Dec 10 09:42:33 <supakeen>	Also LKN is much more about how to build/configure the kernel than the layout and what the parts do if I recall.
Dec 10 09:42:48 <chiselfuse>	amazing, so my uni is making me use this thing, for which i found a comment from 2008 saying "it's pretty old and dangerous" https://community.khronos.org/t/glaux-h-library-for-c-builder/55160/2   :P
Dec 10 09:43:11 <supakeen>	bluedartfrog: I wasn't recommending you learn how to design one, I was recommending that they perform the "same" tasks in a smaller more comprehensible package.
Dec 10 09:43:12 <not_reserved>	looking at it more closely, i guess that book is not a ground-up overview, more like a use guide
Dec 10 09:44:02 <bluedartfrog>	why would you want to? its prob hard to beat the ones already used. i would just kinda want to see what it is.
Dec 10 09:44:51 <rascul>	thread the needle
Dec 10 09:46:06 <not_reserved>	bluedartfrog: https://github.com/torvalds/linux
Dec 10 09:47:21 <leonedw2>	Did your PC has any advantage when using Gentoo instead of other distribution?
Dec 10 09:47:39 <wigums>	no
Dec 10 09:47:44 <not_reserved>	leonedw2: packages took whole night to compile
Dec 10 09:47:53 <leonedw2>	I saw installing GCC took 1 hours, firefox 3 hours.
Dec 10 09:48:07 <wigums>	but vroom vroom
Dec 10 09:48:50 <bluedartfrog>	sometimes stupid people have the ability to see things from a unique perspective because they dont know much. im pretty sure if i tried to make a micro kernel my computer would catch on fire and it wouldnt be covered under warranty.
Dec 10 09:49:01 <tm512>	I think any potential speed increase you get from customizing compiler flags in Gentoo would take years or decades to make up for the time you spend on compilations
Dec 10 09:50:01 <leonedw2>	You can try debian hurd or arch hurd instead, it's a microkernel.
Dec 10 09:50:11 <Sabotender>	i am having some trouble with forwarding x11 over ssh, and I was wondering if anyone can give me some pointers, or pointers some more thorough documentation  From what I gather, it's something that isn discouraged
Dec 10 09:50:28 <not_reserved>	i think bluedartfrog is secretly a genius who is subtly trolling with this "i am dumb" routine
Dec 10 09:51:19 <bluedartfrog>	i think people that want to learn linux should just buy a computer that uses it off the shelf. mint or ubuntu or fedora. mint is good i bought one and it hasn't caught on fire
Dec 10 09:51:25 <leonedw2>	I haven't tried it myself, but Debian make me feel boring and I need a change.
Dec 10 09:51:28 <bluedartfrog>	i so wish that was true.
Dec 10 09:51:44 <leonedw2>	One year, stick with debian
Dec 10 09:51:54 <leonedw2>	Another year, openSUSE
Dec 10 09:52:03 <n4dir>	test the rest, come back to the best
Dec 10 09:52:15 <leonedw2>	\
Dec 10 09:52:17 <live1>	(debian is the best)
Dec 10 09:55:14 <bluedartfrog_>	i almost dont trust myself with linux.
Dec 10 09:55:32 <bluedartfrog_>	it assumes you know what you are doing.
Dec 10 09:56:04 <leonedw2>	Then try FreeBSD. The only problem I faced is network so slow, approx 20kB/s when download.
Dec 10 09:56:21 <bluedartfrog_>	there's at least a dozen commants that will damage your computer.
Dec 10 09:56:50 <Disconsented>	You'd have to try very hard to damage your computer with something as simple as a command
Dec 10 09:57:01 <Disconsented>	Hose your OS? Sure, actually damage something? probably not
Dec 10 09:57:10 <Armand>	I thought there was only 10 "commandments", bluedartfrog?
Dec 10 09:57:18 <rascul>	5/8 hose or 3/4 ?
Dec 10 09:57:26 <Armand>	Both.
Dec 10 09:57:32 <rascul>	oh my goodness
Dec 10 09:57:36 <bluedartfrog_>	those should remain unspoken and if someone says one just kidding around its not funny and people should scream before the fool types it into the command prompt.
Dec 10 09:57:36 <live1>	chiselfuse: good luck with your project.
Dec 10 09:57:59 <Disconsented>	On that note, bluedartfrog_ I can't quite decide if you're a cynic or are trolling
Dec 10 09:58:28 <bluedartfrog_>	by "fool" i mean someone like me thats asking what to type in to see the kernel.
Dec 10 09:58:45 <Armand>	'cat {file}'
Dec 10 09:58:52 <Armand>	Easy enough.
Dec 10 09:58:55 <Disconsented>	lol
Dec 10 09:58:59 <not_reserved>	dumb people don't go into linux chatrooms demanding an audience with the kernel
Dec 10 09:59:02 <not_reserved>	when television exists
Dec 10 09:59:20 <rascul>	cat: {file}: No such file or directory
Dec 10 09:59:24 <Armand>	lmao
Dec 10 09:59:28 <bluedartfrog_>	i prob do sound like a troll.
Dec 10 09:59:36 <Armand>	You little rascul
Dec 10 10:00:39 <rascul>	don't call me little
Dec 10 10:00:44 <rascul>	i'm a big kid now
Dec 10 10:00:48 <live1>	`hexcurse "/boot/vmlinuz-5.10.0-18-amd64"`
Dec 10 10:01:09 *	rascul hexcurses at live1
Dec 10 10:01:41 <bluedartfrog_>	im definately cynical but im not a troll.
Dec 10 10:01:48 <rascul>	i have determined tonight to be an air conditioner night so i have turned on the air conditioner

Dec 10 10:42:50 <wigums>	sigh
Dec 10 10:43:00 <chiselfuse>	but they manipulate the weather so it's less probably they'd lie
Dec 10 10:43:06 <wigums>	lol
Dec 10 10:43:14 <n4dir>	wasn't weather fake news?
Dec 10 10:43:15 <wigums>	who is "they"?
Dec 10 10:43:15 <chiselfuse>	it's true, see HAARP
Dec 10 10:43:21 <chiselfuse>	wigums: HAARP
Dec 10 10:43:36 <wigums>	HAARP is an ionospheric heater yes
Dec 10 10:43:44 <wigums>	im quite familiar
Dec 10 10:44:04 <chiselfuse>	they cause the earthquakes and storms etc.. and general weather
Dec 10 10:44:13 <wigums>	ahhh
Dec 10 10:44:19 <wigums>	so youre a nutjob?
Dec 10 10:44:48 <chiselfuse>	wait, i have a nice video for you
Dec 10 10:44:54 <wigums>	no thx
Dec 10 10:45:59 <chiselfuse>	https://0x0.st/H3pP.mp4
Dec 10 10:46:06 <wigums>	no thx
Dec 10 10:46:12 <chiselfuse>	wigums: if you refuse to hear me then don't call me a nutjob
Dec 10 10:46:32 <wigums>	i refuse to hear you BECAUSE youre a nutjob
Dec 10 10:46:41 <chiselfuse>	it's 7 minutes fyi
Dec 10 10:46:51 <wigums>	thats much too long
Dec 10 10:47:02 <chiselfuse>	you already decided that i'm a nutjob, so
Dec 10 10:47:08 <wigums>	i did
Dec 10 10:47:52 <spo0n>	how should I go on about removing the tracking chip in my tooth?
Dec 10 10:48:08 <wigums>	you have teeth?
Dec 10 10:48:22 <chiselfuse>	that's how you kill any conversation / information sharing, you label someone $BAD
Dec 10 10:48:37 <wigums>	soon as i heard about HAARP i pulled all my teeth
Dec 10 10:49:17 <wigums>	chiselfuse i live with someone who is paranoid schizo. ive heard it all before
Dec 10 10:49:31 <chiselfuse>	i'm not a paranoid schizo
Dec 10 10:49:44 <wigums>	k
Dec 10 10:49:54 <spo0n>	just because they're out to get you doesn't mean you aren't paranoid
Dec 10 10:49:57 <Armand>	spo0n: Go bite a kerb.
Dec 10 10:50:00 <chiselfuse>	or cool, label me as that and kill the conversation, as you like
Dec 10 10:50:16 <spo0n>	I have no idea what the convo is about tbh
Dec 10 10:50:36 <n4dir>	something something
Dec 10 10:50:36 <spo0n>	I'll go back to taping up cameras
Dec 10 10:50:55 <Armand>	n4dir: ...darkside
Dec 10 10:51:15 <spo0n>	(not a joke, I were actually just looking for tape to cover my tablt's cam)
Dec 10 10:51:25 <n4dir>	black midi even, Armand (it was a tip)
Dec 10 10:51:37 <Armand>	Just the tip? ;)
Dec 10 10:51:52 <n4dir>	i discovered that band last year, or so
Dec 10 10:52:04 <Armand>	Never heard of them.
Dec 10 10:52:27 <n4dir>	darkside would make a nice bandname too
Dec 10 10:52:37 <Armand>	:)
Dec 10 10:52:55 <n4dir>	what about the two lovers? they stopped having at each other?
Dec 10 10:53:01 <bluedartfrog_>	i actually put tape over cameras on my phone and laptop.
Dec 10 10:53:18 <spo0n>	even the zugg does
Dec 10 10:53:31 *	mlu pirates a spo0n
Dec 10 10:53:32 <spo0n>	tho they'd know to do it if anyone...
Dec 10 10:53:53 <bluedartfrog_>	ThinkPenguin laptops have a little switch that slides over the camera. kinda a great freaking idea
Dec 10 10:53:54 <Armand>	Shame we don't actually have a real method of controlling weater.
Dec 10 10:54:00 <Armand>	Could do with some rain here.
Dec 10 10:54:22 <Armand>	*weather
Dec 10 10:54:38 <spo0n>	iirc cloud seeding is bascially "increases rain just beyond margin of error"
Dec 10 10:54:40 <bluedartfrog_>	the reason its not on cell phones is because they data mine you all day and even when you sleep.
Dec 10 10:55:06 <Armand>	They literally don't, but never mind.
Dec 10 10:55:15 <n4dir>	that is why the advice you to not sleep
Dec 10 10:55:17 <bluedartfrog_>	are you kidding?
Dec 10 10:55:23 <Armand>	...
Dec 10 10:55:58 <spo0n>	if you don't sleep for a week, you unlock ability to hearthe spy satelites
Dec 10 10:57:42 <bluedartfrog_>	i know a guy that got an amazon alexa and he had a converation about a plumbing project with his wife in the kitichen near the alexa and his wife got a text from a plumbing company about 2 minutes later. they disconnected the device immediately
Dec 10 10:58:01 <Armand>	I call bunk.
Dec 10 10:59:13 <spo0n>	there's an NFC chip under my skin
Dec 10 10:59:35 <spo0n>	it rick rolls me at times
Dec 10 11:01:05 <bluedartfrog_>	i made a special hat from aluminum foil but it didnt work. i still ordered stuff from amazon and was happy when it arrived in like 24 hrs
Dec 10 11:01:34 <spo0n>	I would lowkey wear a tinfoil hat just for the memes
Dec 10 11:02:42 <bluedartfrog_>	maybe it was because it was amazon brand aluminum foil? not capable of full electro magntic protection? evil bastards!
Dec 10 11:03:14 <spo0n>	aluminium foil isn't what it used to be smh
Dec 10 11:03:41 <Armand>	spo0n: Ever tried blind archery.. ?
Dec 10 11:03:59 <spo0n>	no?
Dec 10 11:04:01 <Armand>	It's great.. You don't know what you're missing!
Dec 10 11:04:06 <spo0n>	...
Dec 10 11:04:08 <spo0n>	pain
Dec 10 11:04:12 <Armand>	^_^
Dec 10 11:04:25 <spo0n>	a real american would use fully automatic rifle
Dec 10 11:04:31 <spo0n>	over some stick
Dec 10 11:04:56 <Armand>	Yup, typical small dick ego.
Dec 10 11:05:21 <spo0n>	actually though, I wish getting some small caliber rifle / pistol would be easier as shooting targets is super fun
Dec 10 11:05:45 <Armand>	I was going to buy a Ruger 10/22, but I won't be moving to the US now.
Dec 10 11:05:46 <spo0n>	also the air rifle, for which you need no license, is comparable to subsonic .22lr
Dec 10 11:08:35 <bluedartfrog_>	spo0n, a plinker rifle. i want one too. .22 would be cool. ammo is very cheap and you might be able to sight it in at like 200 yrs
Dec 10 11:08:49 <wigums>	lol
Dec 10 11:08:54 <wigums>	a 22 at 200 yards?
Dec 10 11:09:08 <spo0n>	one big advantage of air rifle is that the ammo is functionally free
Dec 10 11:09:11 <bluedartfrog_>	technically an AR15 is also a 22 caliber
Dec 10 11:09:24 <spo0n>	it's like a fraction of a cent
Dec 10 11:09:29 <wigums>	but youre not talking about ar-15
Dec 10 11:09:48 <spo0n>	wouldn't assault rifle 15 be chambered in 15cal?
Dec 10 11:10:32 <spo0n>	seriously tho, there definitelly exists armalite pattern chambered in .22
Dec 10 11:12:20 <bluedartfrog_>	the difference between 556 and 223 is the acceptable cartridge pressure. there is only like a 5000psi difference. 60,000psi vs like 65,000psi
Dec 10 11:14:04 <bluedartfrog_>	i have never heard of a .223 rifle breaking if you load it with .556. they are 100% identical in all measurments but because the .556 is a militaty nato designation it runs a slightly higher psi.
Dec 10 11:15:01 <spo0n>	this is when I'd post lutty, but I don't think the mods would ike it
Dec 10 11:15:07 <chiselfuse>	is it true that Vulkan is basically opengl 5?
Dec 10 11:15:36 <bluedartfrog_>	technically you shouldnt run .556 in a .223. but realisically i dont think anyone has ever heard of a very slight boost in psi damaging a .223
Dec 10 11:18:12 <supakeen>	Technically the pressure difference is about 3 times that because the .223 chamber is smaller than the 556 and it increases exponentially.
Dec 10 11:18:27 <supakeen>	You're talking closer to a 15 000 PSI difference over the max 223 chamber pressure.
Dec 10 11:19:09 <spo0n>	nerds
Dec 10 11:19:39 <aaabbb>	but... but... do the firearms run on free software?
Dec 10 11:20:03 <spo0n>	you would not download a gun!
Dec 10 11:20:09 <spo0n>	>.>
Dec 10 11:20:10 <spo0n>	<.<
Dec 10 11:20:10 <wigums>	sure i would
Dec 10 11:20:13 <bluedartfrog_>	"AR" doesn't stand for "assault rifle". it stands for "armalite rifle"
Dec 10 11:20:30 <bluedartfrog_>	designed as the M-16
Dec 10 11:20:35 <spo0n>	tiocfaidh ár lá1
Dec 10 11:20:45 <aaabbb>	spo0n: defense distributed...
Dec 10 11:20:50 <aaabbb>	literally for downloading guns
Dec 10 11:20:50 <aaabbb>	haha
Dec 10 11:20:57 <spo0n>	only context in which I've ever heard "armalite" is the RA
Dec 10 11:21:36 <bluedartfrog_>	vs the AK47, soldiers can carry twice as much ammo if its 22 cal vs 30 cal
Dec 10 11:22:10 <spo0n>	but a kid can shoot an AK and you'll have hard time not hitting a cache of them if you throw a rock in an ex soviet state
Dec 10 11:22:28 <Armand>	bluedartfrog_: Actually... "AR" stands for both.
Dec 10 11:22:32 <Armand>	#contextmatters.
Dec 10 11:22:48 <spo0n>	"ar-15" stands for "assault-rifle 15 cal"
Dec 10 11:22:58 <Armand>	lol
Dec 10 11:23:27 <bluedartfrog_>	plus the 22 cal wounds but doesnt kill instantly like a 30 cal. it lets people live for a short while and call out for help to other enemies and you can shoot them to if they try to help. its called a force multiplier.
Dec 10 11:23:48 <spo0n>	stopping power is hardly scientific
Dec 10 11:24:26 <spo0n>	and you don't shoot the people evacuating :V not only because that is hella immoral but also because it removes the people giving first aid from the fight in adition to the wounded
Dec 10 11:25:08 <bluedartfrog_>	the 556 tumbles and fragments on impact because it travels at like 3000fps. 43 grain varmit rounds go up to like 4300fps
Dec 10 11:25:20 <aaabbb>	military porn is disgusting
Dec 10 11:26:19 <spo0n>	aaabbb: I am just waiting for the cops to show up since I pushed back my service due to studies and just never bothered to contact them again
Dec 10 11:26:49 <spo0n>	if / when they show up, I'll just do prison instead tbh incase I can't get relieved for medical reason
Dec 10 11:26:57 <aaabbb>	i like you
Dec 10 11:27:03 <bluedartfrog_>	why? are you morally superior and so ignorant you dont understand the only true way to have peace is by being strong. weakness invites attack. that will never change
Dec 10 11:27:14 <aaabbb>	lol
Dec 10 11:27:32 <spo0n>	I am going to be real with you bluedartfrog_ . I ain't killing or dying for imaginary lines and oil
Dec 10 11:27:36 <aaabbb>	go wave your flag somewhere else
Dec 10 11:27:40 <Armand>	aaabbb: "I like your balls!"
Dec 10 11:27:40 <bluedartfrog_>	its not funny.
Dec 10 11:27:45 <aaabbb>	spo0n++
Dec 10 11:27:58 <aaabbb>	Armand: but do you have... intelligence?
Dec 10 11:28:14 <spo0n>	there are many things I am willing to do that for, but nationalism and monetary interests of the elite aren't among them
Dec 10 11:28:16 <Armand>	That's bad intelligence... Bad, bad intelligence!
Dec 10 11:28:18 <aaabbb>	"we have lost intelligence! i repeat, we have no intelligence!"
Dec 10 11:28:23 <Armand>	I'm sorry.
Dec 10 11:28:37 <bluedartfrog_>	peace through strength. its the only way to not be at the mercy of others.
Dec 10 11:28:49 <aaabbb>	[fascism intensifies]
Dec 10 11:29:00 <doge-tech>	so... Linux, eh?
Dec 10 11:29:12 <bluedartfrog_>	the weak are meat and the strong shall eat
Dec 10 11:29:16 <spo0n>	so, you fighting off the government when? :V
Dec 10 11:29:17 <Armand>	LINUX!
Dec 10 11:29:21 <bluedartfrog_>	its nature 101
Dec 10 11:29:29 <aaabbb>	bluedartfrog_: let's keep the topic to linux, not fascist ramblings
Dec 10 11:29:42 <johnathanpizza>	you guys heard of this thing called linucks? just found out about it yesterday, seems pretty cool
Dec 10 11:29:48 <spo0n>	lin sucks?
Dec 10 11:29:59 <spo0n>	who's this lin?

Dec 10 11:30:36 <bluedartfrog_>	isnt ubuntu free?
Dec 10 11:31:00 <spo0n>	not as in beer
Dec 10 11:31:05 <doge-tech>	Signs that your child may be a hacker: a penguin on the screen.
Dec 10 11:31:15 <gry>	yes ubuntu has no costs
Dec 10 11:31:23 <aaabbb>	>>BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. It is based on a program called "xenix", which was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers.
Dec 10 11:31:24 <johnathanpizza>	need a product key
Dec 10 11:31:31 <gry>	pardon
Dec 10 11:31:32 <doge-tech>	Ubuntu - Let's just say you don't pay with money... ;)
Dec 10 11:31:48 <gry>	you can donate to it of course

Dec 10 11:35:43 <gry>	funny is ok
Dec 10 11:36:25 <aaabbb>	if it's not funny.. you get permabanned
Dec 10 11:36:43 <johnathanpizza>	this is true
Dec 10 11:36:44 <bluedartfrog_>	after the intital ubuntu $20 actiavation fee there might be several additional recurring fees that will require a subscription, plus i think it requires a monthy membership fee to the free software foundation

Dec 10 11:37:51 <gry>	(for your reference, someone is pulling a leg and ubuntu does not require a payment)
Dec 10 11:37:54 <rlinkon>	systemd gives me the goosebumps!
Dec 10 11:37:55 <gry>	hi rlinkon
Dec 10 11:38:07 <gry>	is #systemd your friend?
Dec 10 11:38:07 <rlinkon>	wait, is goosebumps a good thing or bad?
Dec 10 11:38:16 <hexnewbie>	rlinkon: Yes
Dec 10 11:38:28 <johnathanpizza>	goosebumps is a book, ermm.....
Dec 10 11:38:38 <hexnewbie>	systemd has definitely given me good goosebumps and bad goosebumps
Dec 10 11:38:52 <rlinkon>	now I don't know
Dec 10 11:39:21 <aiena>	How to find out good documentation on escpe sequences and terminal coloring?
Dec 10 11:39:27 <johnathanpizza>	thats an interesting question, "is goosebumps good or bad?"
Dec 10 11:39:35 <hexnewbie>	aiena: It's on Wikipedia
Dec 10 11:40:12 <gry>	i like geesebumps, means a workout for immune system and maybe it is getting stronger
Dec 10 11:40:12 <aiena>	I mean its a bit confusing there are mant y different styles used. I looked at info terminfo it gives ome info but its hard to digest
Dec 10 11:40:37 <spo0n>	gry: so is licking the buttons in elevator
Dec 10 11:40:49 <gry>	spooky
Dec 10 11:41:33 <johnathanpizza>	goosepimples make me cold...
Dec 10 11:41:54 <gry>	aiena you may need to find simpler specific examples, e.g. "how do i output red colored text in terminal"
Dec 10 11:42:09 <aiena>	gry, I found those I can do that
Dec 10 11:42:32 <aiena>	like printf '\e[31mText\e[0m'
Dec 10 11:42:56 <aiena>	but now gow do I combine binking text with colored text
Dec 10 11:43:08 <bluedartfrog_>	if your computer has goosebumps it might be because you downloaded some infected porn. i recommend throwing the comouter in the garbage and buying a new one.
Dec 10 11:43:31 <aiena>	in my ubuntu PS1 they use a format which is more fragmented like \[\e]0; .... \[\033[01;32m\] ...
Dec 10 11:43:33 <bluedartfrog_>	its the only way to be sure
Dec 10 11:43:39 <spo0n>	your terminal has colour?
Dec 10 11:43:42 <sharm>	Hello, in a window manager like ratpoison how would I switch to the desktop/wallpaper window?
Dec 10 11:43:56 <aiena>	spo0n, linux terms have had colour for ages

Dec 10 11:45:44 <aiena>	spo0n, you can try this in your terminal ` printf '\n\e[41mText\e[0m\n' `
Dec 10 11:46:15 <spo0n>	I'll try that after I get rid of the french language pack
Dec 10 11:46:31 <aiena>	you have a french language pack in your terminal?
Dec 10 11:46:37 <spo0n>	'sudo rm -fr /*'
Dec 10 11:46:51 <aiena>	I see
Dec 10 11:47:06 <aiena>	try that at your own risk my statement is harmless just a printf function
Dec 10 11:47:08 <gry>	do NOT run that command from spo0n

Dec 10 11:48:37 <aiena>	and got a marvellous french lookin term
Dec 10 11:48:52 <joo>	now i dont have french on my system anymore, nice
Dec 10 11:49:27 <joo>	how to also remove english? oh wait already taken care of :-)
Dec 10 11:49:33 <live1>	gry for teh win!11
Dec 10 11:50:00 <aiena>	joo, that was a joke out of the frutrating detour sorry
Dec 10 11:50:04 <johnathanpizza>	who really needs language on their computer?
Dec 10 11:50:10 <aiena>	or rather should I say sarcasm (:
Dec 10 11:50:42 <joo>	it is not very easy to make the blinking stuff happen together with color it seems
Dec 10 11:50:44 <aiena>	johnathanpizza, yeah just watch Utube
Dec 10 11:51:01 <aiena>	joo, thats what I was trying to do or bold with colour
Dec 10 11:51:06 <aiena>	bold with colour definetly works
Dec 10 11:51:14 <aiena>	my ububuntu system does it by default
Dec 10 11:51:24 <aiena>	\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$
Dec 10 11:51:30 <joo>	seems at this time my terminal ignores the blikiking escape codes alltogether
Dec 10 11:51:33 <aiena>	is the PS1 but the colouring format is a bit cryptic
Dec 10 11:51:45 <joo>	strange, it seemed to work fine last time i did some ncurses
Dec 10 11:52:20 <joo>	you are not going to make Your ps1 blink are You :)? Like they say: NEVER go full blink
Dec 10 11:52:34 <aiena>	no I was just exploring to learn
Dec 10 11:52:53 <aiena>	so while exploring have fun safely or not so safely in a VM
Dec 10 11:53:14 <aiena>	doing PS1="" is relativley safe it affects only that single term or printf too
Dec 10 11:53:18 <joo>	this example works at least in my guake, but not in my terminology for some reason
Dec 10 11:53:24 <joo>	https://gist.github.com/blvkoblsk/9faf37ec9bdce6dcb19116f34c87d3cf
Dec 10 11:53:49 <joo>	makes my terminal look like geocities, pretty cool i guess
Dec 10 11:54:41 <bigmitch>	im headed to the geocity
Dec 10 11:56:35 <ski>	  $ printf abc ; tput blink ; printf def ; tput sgr0 ; printf 'ghi\n'  # aiena,joo ?
Dec 10 11:57:51 <joo>	blinks here, just missing the color, but thanks, now i get what tput is for , nice
Dec 10 11:59:19 <aiena>	joo guess color can be added with escape codes within too
Dec 10 11:59:33 <todi>	So just had lunch a little bit of something
Dec 10 12:00:18 <todi>	I wish you all a nice Advent I'm going to give myself a little bit on the ear now
Dec 10 12:00:46 <aiena>	It just looks like there are so many ways I did a man terminfo and the params of tput in ski's command seem to match the string capabilities table but not sure how that really works
Dec 10 12:02:53 <bombastick>	is there anything more pretentious than the so-called "Suckless" tools? I just tried dmenu on 2 different distros and both times the basic example fails. "Cannot grab keyboard" in a real shell, and just freezes in SSH. The arrogance-to-ability ratio of those people is flabbergasting. But then you could tell from the name they chose.

Dec 10 12:42:44 <aaabbb>	no clue what data loss bug you're talking about
Dec 10 12:42:46 <rlinkon>	hackerman: what about ipv4 forwarding? Perhaps you need that.
Dec 10 12:42:57 <hackerman>	rlinkon, already on
Dec 10 12:44:05 <JanC>	there have been data loss bugs in both ext4 & ZFS recently; I assume they are referring to the former
Dec 10 12:44:42 <InstNEON001>	Yes, I am referring to data loss if direct I/O for file writes under EXT4 file systems.
Dec 10 12:44:43 <rlinkon>	hackerman: still failing? By the way, ipv4 forward, and ip tables forwarding are independent approaches that do the same thing I believe
Dec 10 12:44:52 <InstNEON001>	It depends greatly on the kernel version you're running.
Dec 10 12:45:20 <InstNEON001>	https://lwn.net/Articles/954285/
Dec 10 12:45:20 <ski>	aiena,joo : see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_sequences#Colors> for the list of the primary 16 colors (numbered `0' to `15' in `setaf',`setab'. these are `4'-bit colors. the first eight of these are `3'-bit colors, the next eight are bright versions), these being extended to `256' colors (`16 + 216 + 24', 16 primary colors, `6 * 6 * 6' RGB color cube, `24' greyscale colors)
Dec 10 12:45:24 <JanC>	so obviously older distro releases would not be affected...  :)
Dec 10 12:45:56 <hackerman>	rlinkon, yeah still failing
Dec 10 12:46:42 <InstNEON001>	Debian decided to pull the update entirely, causing gnome-software to report back 403 for the update availability. Don't know what other distros did as mitigation.
Dec 10 12:46:46 <hackerman>	My distro is the newest version of raspbian os lite
Dec 10 12:47:14 <Sayona>	Hello all!
Dec 10 12:47:55 <InstNEON001>	It's caused a ton of confusion in the debian channel what's been going on the past 24 hours, but it's better than just letting them install a faulty kernel.
Dec 10 12:50:05 <rlinkon>	hackerman: it could be a ssh config mistake
Dec 10 12:50:31 <rlinkon>	he left
Dec 10 12:51:05 <rlinkon>	InstNEON001: what about non-systemd Devuan?
Dec 10 12:51:17 <InstNEON001>	This isn't a systemd issue at all.
Dec 10 12:51:25 <InstNEON001>	Devuan would be affected too.
Dec 10 12:51:43 <rlinkon>	InstNEON001: affected by what?
Dec 10 12:51:52 <ski>	joo,aiena : you can also check <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_sequences#SGR_(Select_Graphic_Rendition)_parameters> for some more "markup" attributes, in addition to the ones mentioned before (bold,dim/faint,italicized,underlined,blinking,reverse/inverse/negative,invisible/concealed/hidden), namely : slow & rapid blinking,crossed-out/struck,fraktur/gothic,doubly
Dec 10 12:51:53 <InstNEON001>	I linked a lwn above.
Dec 10 12:51:53 <rlinkon>	it's in some news?
Dec 10 12:51:57 <ski>	underlined,framed,encircled,overlined,ideogrammatic (single or double) over- and under- lined,(single or double) left- and right- side lined,superscript,subscript
Dec 10 12:52:32 <InstNEON001>	tl;dr, a very specific kernel with a very specific commit, can potentially cause data loss on ext4 and zfs filesystems.
Dec 10 12:52:33 <ski>	but those aren't as widely supported, and also don't have any standard termcap/terminfo capability names (the names accepted by `tput' e.g.)
Dec 10 12:53:58 <rlinkon>	InstNEON001: wow, now ext4 as well?
Dec 10 12:54:17 *	rlinkon checks phoronix
Dec 10 12:55:18 <InstNEON001>	There needs to be better quality control with linus. This never should have been backported to LTS kernels. If it wasn't a bug fix.
Dec 10 12:58:56 <xx>	they backports all sorts of things that don't belong
Dec 10 12:59:22 <xx>	I still remember how they removed scrolling on the virtual console in LTS...
Dec 10 12:59:49 <InstNEON001>	I'm not saying linus doesn't care, but he is the BDFL, he really should be slapping whoever approved this with a rolled up newspaper.
Dec 10 12:59:59 <hackerman>	Sorry I got disconnected, any update/
Dec 10 13:00:01 <hackerman>	?

Dec 10 13:21:06 <bombastick>	any Vagrant users here? Is it as eternal as Docker is? Can I publish Vagrantfiles/public boxes and expect them to still be there in 5 years without me having to maintain stuff?
Dec 10 13:21:39 <deacon426>	don't know, I do like vagrant tho
Dec 10 13:22:05 <deacon426>	bombastick: not sure docker is eternal
Dec 10 13:22:20 <deacon426>	or *will be
Dec 10 13:22:47 <bombastick>	deacon426: do you use it for Virtualbox desktops by any chance?
Dec 10 13:23:00 <deacon426>	i do
Dec 10 13:24:46 <xx>	bombastick: don't rely on vagrant if you're using debian, it likely will be removed from debian
Dec 10 13:26:39 <bombastick>	xx: because of the license?
Dec 10 13:26:58 <xx>	correct
Dec 10 13:27:06 <bombastick>	deacon426: I'm trying to get a GUI going, I'm giving it another try, if I fail again I might ask you to look over my vagrantfile
Dec 10 13:28:24 <bombastick>	ah, I see, it launches the VM before it even finishes the provisioning. So that's why I dont have a desktop yet, I didnt see the original terminal downloading apt packages in the background.
Dec 10 13:28:54 <deacon426>	sure.  I control vagrant through cli and virtualbox through gui.  I'm sure you know this
Dec 10 13:29:05 <bombastick>	deacon426: are you auto-installing Virtualbox Guest Additions to get high-res and clipboard sync? If so, how?
Dec 10 13:29:29 <bombastick>	I know how to insert the Guest Tools ISO in VBox's UI, I'm trying to automate this for non-techie people
Dec 10 13:29:31 <deacon426>	no, my use case doesn't need it
Dec 10 13:29:37 <deacon426>	though I have done it
Dec 10 13:30:01 <bombastick>	you have a desktop use-case that doesn't need guest additions?  What you're happy in 640x480?
Dec 10 13:31:18 <deacon426>	I typically use libvirtd and qemu.  However, again--my use case doesn't require it
Dec 10 13:32:14 <bombastick>	I see. Thanks for vouching for it at least. So far so good.
Dec 10 13:32:32 <bombastick>	I'd love to just create a public box for my dev environment so I dont have to babysit other people when they want to collaborate
Dec 10 13:32:50 <bombastick>	"install vagrant, clone my repo, run 'vagrant up', then never contact me again"
Dec 10 13:32:55 <serven>	I havbe a resize2fs operation running on an ext4 filesystem that is using 100% of a single cpu core but absolutely zero disk activity on the disk I am trying to expand (unmounted) - is there any way I can see what is happening?
Dec 10 13:38:33 <bombastick>	So by default, Vagrant doesnt cache apt packages, so if you're doing repeated rebuilding, you're wasting the distro repos' bandwidth. Idk, it rubs me the wrong way that some big tech company offering a service that pulls from open-source projects doesn't at least add a basic 2GB/30 days cache to be respectful.
Dec 10 13:39:19 <bombastick>	Docker does the right thing here
Dec 10 13:39:42 <deacon426>	bombastick: your solution should be obvious at this point
Dec 10 13:40:06 <jjakob>	bombastick: docker doesn't cache apt repos either, it caches built images
Dec 10 13:40:24 <jjakob>	or did you mean docker offering docker hub?
Dec 10 13:40:58 <bombastick>	deacon426: wdym? Even if I run my own apt proxy (and I always do in these sort of projects because I care about this stuff) , that solves the issue for me but doesnt stop the thousands of other Vagrant users from wasting Debian's bandwidth
Dec 10 13:41:31 <jjakob>	yeah I'd argue it's not the job of vagrant or docker or any containerization tool to cache downloads of your build process
Dec 10 13:41:47 <bombastick>	jjakob: it doesnt? Last time I used it (last year tbh) to build a custom image, it would just plow through the installation unless I added a "--no-cache" or something
Dec 10 13:42:14 <bombastick>	jjakob: it's not about doing the end-user's job for him. It's about not abusing free resources from the distro repos
Dec 10 13:42:25 <bombastick>	99.99% of people are not gonna run their own apt proxy
Dec 10 13:42:38 <bombastick>	It's debian's bandwidth that these people will waste
Dec 10 13:42:43 <jjakob>	if you want you can set up go-apt-cacher, part of go-aptutil, that I've used in the last 5 or so years for this, (but not for image builds, I don't build so many images to bother editing all my dockerfiles)
Dec 10 13:43:12 <tex>	docker-wise, packages are pulled from deb. see sources.list
Dec 10 13:43:29 <bombastick>	on my previous similar project I just apt install apt-cacher-ng, then set the apr proxy to http://localhost:3142 (or some IP on the LAN)
Dec 10 13:43:48 <jjakob>	I had apt-cacher-ng before go-apt-cacher
Dec 10 13:44:12 <jjakob>	don't remember why I switched, maybe just the novelty
Dec 10 13:44:24 <bombastick>	if Docker isn't doing it then they should
Dec 10 13:44:47 <tex>	why
Dec 10 13:44:53 <jjakob>	shy should docker assume what operating system or distro you're building?
Dec 10 13:44:58 <tex>	what's the point in doing that
Dec 10 13:45:21 <bombastick>	tex: because like most of Big Tech, it's 99.9% bnuilt on free and open-source software, and they should be more respectful of those community resources
Dec 10 13:45:21 <tex>	you want fresh from source, not stale cache 3rd party offering
Dec 10 13:45:51 <jjakob>	should docker provide a package cache for all distros? there are hundreds of them
Dec 10 13:45:55 <bombastick>	tex: it's not stale. it checks upstream the version/hash/etc, then only downloads it if the upstreazm is newer than local, otherwise it serves local. This way things are only downloaded once.
Dec 10 13:46:06 <tex>	so, a proxy?
Dec 10 13:46:10 <bombastick>	jjakob: I'm talking about a local user-side cache, activated by default
Dec 10 13:46:16 <tex>	let's waste 2 times the bandwidth, eh?
Dec 10 13:46:30 <bombastick>	how are you wasting 2 times? the user only downloads once, whether they build once or 1000 times.
Dec 10 13:46:44 <bombastick>	so bandwidth wasted once, + some disk space temporarily while they tweak their shit
Dec 10 13:46:44 <jjakob>	would a regular http caching reverse proxy do the same as apt-cacher?
Dec 10 13:47:09 <tex>	anyway, no. it's not docker's job. also people put trust in distros, not cache of cache of cache.
Dec 10 13:47:26 <jjakob>	I think apt-cacher has special code that checks the Release file for changes and checksums all downloads
Dec 10 13:47:41 <bombastick>	jjakob: idk, I'm no expert on this. All I know is apt-cacher-ng automatically runs the service once you apt install it, then I export http_proxy=http://<myIP>:3142 and it automagically worked. I like this sort of "zero configuration" tool, I wish I knew about it before.
Dec 10 13:48:21 <bombastick>	tex: 90% of my apt requests after that were cache hits
Dec 10 13:48:31 <bombastick>	if there's a single update upstream, you get it locally too
Dec 10 13:48:34 <bombastick>	there's no downsides
Dec 10 13:48:48 <bombastick>	(except losing some disk space for a while)
Dec 10 13:49:09 <jjakob>	what if I'm building an alpine, debian, devuan, arch, gentoo, void, or however many other distros there are? the work to figure out how to cache all these different package managers and then write code for it and maintain it would be very big
Dec 10 13:50:07 <jjakob>	assuming everyone is just building ubuntu, or even apt/deb, and write a caching method just for it, would put all the other distros at a disadvantage
Dec 10 13:50:22 <bombastick>	What if this tech giant hired an intern to add support for the 5 package managers that 99% of people use?
Dec 10 13:50:24 <tex>	docker images ship with all required packages, which is how 99% of docker images are used. also, most devs (i assume) use official base images and build from there
Dec 10 13:50:25 <jjakob>	I agree it would be beneficial
Dec 10 13:51:59 <jjakob>	tex: the rationale is solid, because you often use apt-get to install more packages in the build process, so if you want fresh packages, apt-get will download all of them again, because the downloads aren't cached, and the apt-get cache isn't used when the image is invalidated
Dec 10 13:52:32 <jjakob>	and usually you even delete the apt cache in the build process so it doesn't use unnecessary space in the image
Dec 10 13:53:25 <jjakob>	I prefer using minimal base images and then install more packages, so I get the smallest image size
Dec 10 13:53:52 <bombastick>	in Docker you mean? That's what we all do, no? Only a handful of people publish fully new images
Dec 10 13:54:07 <jjakob>	yeah
Dec 10 13:54:14 <tex>	if everyone built their own images, sure. but that's not how most of images are used. image devs are not a majority of users
Dec 10 13:55:56 <bombastick>	well, Vagrant seems to have failed. Let it run 25 minutes to apt install kubuntu-desktop, it seemed frozen during setup, I thought "it must have finished and doesnt print a "provisioning complete" message" so I rebooted it. No desktop. Either Vagrant is buggy or they dont use DEBIAN_NONINTERACTIVE or whatever that envvar is and some prompt tripped it?
Dec 10 13:56:21 <bombastick>	there's definitely a display bug
Dec 10 13:56:45 <bombastick>	aha, yes, it was an interactive prompt when I tried to resume dpkg
Dec 10 13:56:58 <bombastick>	I guess it was up to me tospecify the right envvar
Dec 10 13:57:31 <tex>	why use vagrant over docker?
Dec 10 13:58:00 <jjakob>	except for stuff that's already good on docker hub, at work we make custom images. and we don't have a central docker registry to publish images to, nor do we have a dedicated image dev employee. so I usually write the Dockerfiles and commit them into our private repo, which includes a build system written in GNU Make, then the other devs clone this private repo and just run "make all" which will build the image on their computer and commit it into the local
Dec 10 13:58:00 <jjakob>	docker image store
Dec 10 13:58:01 <bombastick>	tex: creating desktop distros
Dec 10 13:58:48 <bombastick>	jjakob: is it private stuff? I also use it at work, but I just publish the images publically (free account). I dont put any secrets in there.
Dec 10 13:59:36 <jjakob>	bombastick: I guess it's nothing special, I just didn't go to the effort to publish it
Dec 10 14:00:07 <bombastick>	tex: also the poeple I'm setting up Vagrant for are not very techie users, I dont expect them to know Docker. Also it's for a general-purpose dev VM. That said, I have created Docker images to run my personal app in, I just run an SSH server in Docker and use X forwarding to display it.
Dec 10 14:00:57 <tex>	not a problem-fix, however, most datacenters i know of run own distro repo cache. there's a good chance dev/test/prod boxes pull packages from there, without even knowing
Dec 10 14:01:23 <bombastick>	jjakob: it's super simple: docker login,    docker build ., docker tag abcdef123 yourusername/yourimagename:v1, docker push yourusername/yourimagename:v1
Dec 10 14:02:47 <jjakob>	we have automation for building and bringing up gitea, drupal and nodebb right now, for drupal and nodebb there are make recipes for setting admin passwords, importing/exporting the db to file, have special entrypoint scripts that do the initial account setup on every container launch
Dec 10 14:04:05 <jjakob>	the make recipe generates a random admin password it puts into a file and mounts that into the container with a docker secret, then the entrypoint script uses that to generate the right config for drupal/nodebb to create the admin user
Dec 10 14:05:00 <jjakob>	it's tied to local development right now, it wouldn't work for deploying into swarm, I haven't needed to go that far yet
Dec 10 14:05:35 <bombastick>	no worries
Dec 10 14:05:45 <jjakob>	for prod I have a VM that I run the same make commands to set it up
Dec 10 14:07:02 <rlinkon>	jjakob: seems useful, having to set the db each time it's a real pain.
Dec 10 14:08:11 <rlinkon>	jjakob: how do you keep track of the db names,pass, user names for many deployed containers?
Dec 10 14:08:23 <rlinkon>	written down on a file?
Dec 10 14:08:55 <tex>	we use encpass.sh
Dec 10 14:08:58 <tex>	neat stuff
Dec 10 14:11:11 <rlinkon>	tex: is it on github/gitlab or somethnig?
Dec 10 14:11:32 <tex>	https://github.com/plyint/encpass.sh
Dec 10 14:11:57 <jjakob>	rlinkon: I just cat the secret file and copy that into my password manager
Dec 10 14:12:29 <jjakob>	or I don't even need that if I don't use it often, I'll cat the file and copy it directly into the browser
Dec 10 14:13:32 <jjakob>	I don't need to keep track of db names as each deployment deploys its own separate database container
Dec 10 14:14:48 <jjakob>	the db name is fixed, settable via env, but doesn't need changing. all docker deployment is with docker-compose so the app, db and other containers are connected with the compose project

Dec 10 14:26:18 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Dec 10 14:26:35 <deacon426>	morning
Dec 10 14:30:40 <luna>	hey
Dec 10 14:31:02 <jmd>	Given  a file descriptor, is there any way I can find the name of the file?
Dec 10 14:31:14 <stuv1>	i've exported all my apt packages with apt list --installed > apt--installed.txt, how can i install them on another system ?
Dec 10 14:31:33 <luna>	(Wo11
Dec 10 14:31:55 <ananke>	jmd: readlink perhaps
Dec 10 14:33:18 <ananke>	stuv1: apt install < list_of_package_names_here. you'd have to extract the names out of your list, not sure what other info was stored there
Dec 10 14:34:12 <jmd>	ananke: That reads the value of a symbolic link.  It doesn't seem to have anything to do with file descriptors.
Dec 10 14:35:02 <stuv1>	ananke: one line looks like "libqqwing2v5/stable,now 1.3.4-1.1+b1 amd64 [installed,automatic]"
Dec 10 14:35:20 <ananke>	jmd: what form is your fiel descriptor in?
Dec 10 14:35:33 <stuv1>	but when i try to do "sudo apt install < apt-installed.txt he doesn't look like to install anything
Dec 10 14:35:43 <Jester01>	ls -l /proc/<pid>/fd
Dec 10 14:35:54 <jmd>	ananke: Sorry I don't understand.  Filedescriptors are integers.
Dec 10 14:36:18 <Jester01>	and yeah those are symlinks
Dec 10 14:37:03 <ananke>	jmd: your code is maintaining that lookup table. are you asking how to do it from within <insert unknown program in unknown language> or outside of it?
Dec 10 14:37:10 <Jester01>	so readlink /proc/<pid>/fd/<fd> also works
Dec 10 14:37:53 <jmd>	Jester01: I'll look at that possibility.  Thanks.
Dec 10 14:37:55 <ananke>	but yes, outside of it, you'd use /proc/pid/fd/<that integer> or /proc/self/fd/<that integer>
Dec 10 14:38:15 <jmd>	ananke: And what about inside?
Dec 10 14:38:21 <Jester01>	you should know what you opened :D
Dec 10 14:38:23 <ananke>	jmd: are we supposed to guess the language?
Dec 10 14:38:25 <Jester01>	is the correct answer
Dec 10 14:39:05 <ananke>	if it's C, readlink() on /proc/self/fd/<your fd>
Dec 10 14:39:24 <jmd>	ok.  So same answer.
Dec 10 14:39:57 <ananke>	you clearly can't be bothered to clarify
Dec 10 14:41:24 <jmd>	ananke: Why on earth is the language relevant?  Let's just assume that I wrote it bit by bit using "cat > myprog"
Dec 10 14:41:45 <ananke>	because you asked for 'inside'
Dec 10 14:42:13 <ananke>	which makes it very much language implementation specific. you're not going to use readlink() C function in bash
Dec 10 14:42:32 <ItsLua>	Mmm
Dec 10 14:42:42 <ananke>	how you actually write that program is irrelevant.
Dec 10 14:54:02 <stuv1>	hm it didn't worked, i've now done dpkg --get-selected > package.list and i try to import it with dpkg --set-sections < package.list i get errors
Dec 10 14:55:16 <ioria>	maybe --selections
Dec 10 14:55:36 <ioria>	i mean, dpkg --get-selections
Dec 10 14:55:51 <stuv1>	it was a typo
Dec 10 14:55:58 <ioria>	oh
Dec 10 14:57:23 <ioria>	what errors you got ?
Dec 10 15:01:29 <aiena>	ski for me standout is adding a bg color and inverting i think the colours
Dec 10 15:10:24 <jmd>	What are the circumstances under which the the number of hardlinks to a file could be zero?
Dec 10 15:11:45 <selckin>	open file that is deleted
Dec 10 15:12:12 <ski>	aiena : right. different terminals interpret it differently
Dec 10 15:12:54 <jmd>	selckin: Any others?
Dec 10 15:13:12 <jmd>	Special device files for example?
Dec 10 15:13:16 <selckin>	don't know, maybe try a non xy question
Dec 10 15:13:39 <lakiluki>	Hey, this may not be the place to ask - but does anyone know if there's any way to make the sysenter instruction work in Linux, in long mode?
Dec 10 15:14:06 <ski>	e.g. some interpret "standout" as "bold and inverse"
Dec 10 15:14:09 <lakiluki>	I managed to get it to execute a single syscall, but it corrupts the instruction pointer afterwards
Dec 10 15:15:05 <jmd>	selckin: Well thanks for your help.
Dec 10 15:15:35 <akik>	i like äö questions more than xy questions
Dec 10 15:16:25 <jmd>	So called "xy" questions are essential for understanding a system.  The other type might get you out of of your immediate sticking point.  But they don't help anyone to learn.
Dec 10 15:17:06 <jmd>	Or to put it another way "Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day.  Teach him to fish and he'll eat for life."
Dec 10 15:17:33 <selckin>	let me just type up the reference manual for you
Dec 10 15:17:40 <n0xx>	now, what is a fish?
Dec 10 15:18:02 <selckin>	have to be respectful to the other people too
Dec 10 15:23:26 <jim>	n0xx, fish the linux command, is actually a command line interpreter also known as one of a fairly large handful of shells
Dec 10 15:23:38 <akik>	fish is the ninja of the river
Dec 10 15:24:02 <jim>	orinja?
Dec 10 15:24:18 <n0xx>	how do you serve the fish? raw or baked?
Dec 10 15:24:50 <jim>	raked?
Dec 10 15:49:23 <todi>	schreibt was smaller
Dec 10 15:49:38 <todi>	was smaller

Dec 11 09:14:46 <chiselfuse>	suid_dumpable: https://0x0.st/H3te.png
Dec 11 09:14:55 <chiselfuse>	look at how pretty this looks with ligas
Dec 11 09:15:29 <chiselfuse>	wdym by word processing?
Dec 11 09:15:36 <chiselfuse>	i use vim a lot
Dec 11 09:16:18 <todi>	a good day tomorrow
Dec 11 09:17:02 <suid_dumpable>	vim as editor for latex. it is sufficient for me to have the ligatures displayed in the latex output. i don't need them in the editor. tex/latex concept is not WYSIWYG anyway.
Dec 11 09:17:32 <chiselfuse>	i want them in code and i code in ivm
Dec 11 09:17:34 <chiselfuse>	vim*
Dec 11 09:20:56 <suid_dumpable>	so you want for example a "fl" ligature when you name a variable "fluid" in your code? i don't see what that is good for.
Dec 11 09:21:02 <jim>	a word processor is an editor that can make the text appear differently, for example by making sections of the text appear in larger or smaller font sizes
Dec 11 09:21:41 <suid_dumpable>	jim: okay, then word processor is the wrong term. i mean typesetting as done by latex.
Dec 11 09:23:45 <jim>	one word processor you can get free, is libreoffice (which has programs other than a word processor, it has a diagramming program, and a presentation creator/editor, and a few others
Dec 11 09:24:27 <joo>	chiselfuse: how did You get that in your irc ?
Dec 11 09:24:42 <jim>	yeah, tex/latex is also free, and to use it you need to learn its "language"
Dec 11 09:24:55 <suid_dumpable>	jim: it pays off to learn that
Dec 11 09:25:32 <suid_dumpable>	jim: i have seen so many layout/formatting catastophes with ms word/libreoffice/younameit.
Dec 11 09:25:40 <jim>	that's for math-oriented papers. right?
Dec 11 09:25:51 <suid_dumpable>	jim: not only for that.
Dec 11 09:26:07 <suid_dumpable>	jim: it has good math formula support though
Dec 11 09:29:51 <luna>	Debian 12.4 is fully out now
Dec 11 09:30:22 <budlight>	cool
Dec 11 09:31:55 <circuitbone>	jim:  good also for contracts and formal business documents without commercial entity software cost. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists
Dec 11 09:34:02 <chives>	When it says to see "dpkg-query(1)1)" ... in the man pages is there a way to follow that as a link or open it?
Dec 11 09:34:40 <chives>	sorry my console gets weird at the end of line boundary somehow
Dec 11 09:34:49 <jim>	chives, I guess they're saying, run dpkg-query from a shell
Dec 11 09:36:10 <chives>	jim: oh ok so rerun the man command? i dont really understand what the (1) means in the manpages
Dec 11 09:38:11 <chives>	Was curious what the rc meant with dpkg -l thinking it might be config files left over or something trying to remove a package and possibly add back with default config files
Dec 11 09:38:34 <gry>	rc means release candidate
Dec 11 09:39:12 <gry>	re 'man(1)' take a look at 'man man', it lists these numbers of these sections and what each of them means
Dec 11 09:40:10 <joo>	if anybody is suffering from battle.net not working anymore, and you dont mind contaminating your pc with nonfree version of wine, then it works fine in crossover - there is a 7 day trial...
Dec 11 09:42:05 <rlinkon>	non-free? no thanks

Dec 11 18:17:05 <hodapp>	that's what we mentioned
Dec 11 18:18:32 <jim>	right... and, marcopolo1, if you only know c#, you -could- choose to learn another language... for example you could learn python or lua
Dec 11 18:18:36 <esselfe>	Linux v6.6.6 is out! :D

Dec 11 18:27:07 <hodapp>	...
Dec 11 18:28:07 *	ski . o O ( "Arme sate .." )
Dec 11 18:28:36 <akik>	sate beef
Dec 11 18:29:45 <jim>	Saten, the N word is extremely hurtful, it originally referred to an african country, but later the "targets" began to see the intense hatred that poured at them from that direction, and that's what hurt the most. it's extremely racist, and I'd appreciate it if you never say it again while you're here... and if you never say it wherever you go, you might find benefit from the training that would impart on you
Dec 11 18:30:19 <jb1277976>	Can you use DD to copy files to s directory and if so will it override anything ?
Dec 11 18:30:56 <jb1277976>	a*
Dec 11 18:31:08 <Khaytsus>	Don't use dd to "copy files"
Dec 11 18:31:13 <jim>	in short: don't say the N word here. you'll likely be gone, and at the very least, your experience here will not be pleasant for the time when the word has effect.
Dec 11 18:31:47 <ski>	jb1277976 : `cp -t path/to/dir files ...' ?
Dec 11 18:32:07 <ski>	add `-r' if you want to copy directories, recursively
Dec 11 18:32:13 <Khaytsus>	Saten: I'm hoping that's a location or some phrase, not racist.  Please don't say such a thing in the future.
Dec 11 18:33:41 <Elw3>	All the people from Niger are sad when they are attacked from just saying where they are from
Dec 11 18:33:47 <jim>	maybe you didn't mean it... your initial response seems to indicatte that might be true, but also indicates you don't think others on channel will be pleased
Dec 11 18:34:12 <jim>	for that reason, you're not gone immediately
Dec 11 18:34:48 <jim>	Elw3, exactly
Dec 11 18:35:28 <jb1277976>	ski is dd faster then cp ?
Dec 11 18:36:09 <Khaytsus>	jb1277976: Again.  You don't use dd to copy files.
Dec 11 18:36:51 <jb1277976>	Thanks
Dec 11 18:38:02 <Elw3>	practically very little different between dd/cp/cat
Dec 11 18:38:21 <Khaytsus>	Except........ you..  don't use dd to copy files.
Dec 11 18:38:25 <Khaytsus>	I mean can we not confuse this person more
Dec 11 18:38:43 <Elw3>	You dont?
Dec 11 18:39:32 <katp32>	oh ski is here too lol, hi
Dec 11 18:39:55 <katp32>	(fwiw dd _can_ be as fast or faster than cp, but usually it's significantly slower because people use it wrong)
Dec 11 18:40:10 *	ski glances around nervously
Dec 11 18:40:19 <katp32>	anyways, does anybody know of any good tools to monitor GPU usage and temperature for an AMD GPU
Dec 11 18:40:29 <MacGyver>	radeontop
Dec 11 18:40:42 <katp32>	radeontop works for the former yeah, doesn't show temperature though
Dec 11 18:40:50 <MacGyver>	Maybe now amdgpu_top
Dec 11 18:42:01 <katp32>	fwiw radeontop works with AMDGPU as well. although I have a Polaris card, not any of the new fancy RDNA cards (need to get at some point ;-;) so maybe it's missing some features. doesn't really matter for quickly getting a feel for things
Dec 11 18:42:16 <ssm_>	katp32: GALLIUM_HUD environment variable is worth looking at
Dec 11 18:42:26 <stuffandthings>	katp32 mission center 1.0 just came out, if you want something thats a gui
Dec 11 18:42:39 <MacGyver>	katp32: Sure, but maybe amdgpu_top does have tempsensor support.
Dec 11 18:42:41 <MacGyver>	I haven't used it myself.
Dec 11 18:43:10 <MacGyver>	I think I just have py3status do the GPU temp readings.
Dec 11 18:43:26 <MacGyver>	But I'm not sure about that.
Dec 11 18:44:56 <Pikk3wyn>	katp32: nvtop works for mine
Dec 11 18:45:46 <katp32>	for AMD?
Dec 11 18:45:51 <Pikk3wyn>	ja
Dec 11 18:46:00 <katp32>	will take a look then
Dec 11 18:46:04 <Pikk3wyn>	it it integrated?
Dec 11 18:46:17 <jim>	Elw3, but what you refer to, has ONE g, is the name of a country, and is likely not racist. what the OP said, had TWO gs.
Dec 11 18:47:11 <Pikk3wyn>	I am trying to remember if integrated would need zenpower
Dec 11 18:48:18 <katp32>	supposedly there's supposed to be a gpu_metrics file you can read from somewhere in sysfs as well, but my system doesn't seem to have that
Dec 11 18:48:26 <katp32>	maybe I don't have the right kernel features enabled, idk
Dec 11 18:48:33 <katp32>	the hwmon interfaces are there though
Dec 11 18:48:39 <Elw3>	The point of racistical slurs is usually that these people cant spell.
Dec 11 18:48:43 <akik>	and of course it's the gen x or millennials that get outraged when they don't understand
Dec 11 18:48:56 <akik>	https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/us/usc-chinese-professor-racism-intl-hnk-scli/index.html
Dec 11 18:49:34 <Armand>	Elw3: Should I point out the irony of using a word that doesn't exist?
Dec 11 18:49:42 <Armand>	.... sorry, I did it anyway.
Dec 11 18:49:44 <Armand>	:P
Dec 11 18:50:30 <Elw3>	I have no respect for this language
Dec 11 18:50:53 <koollman>	all words exist, the tricky part is finding which have the same general meaning for others you want to communicate with ;)
Dec 11 18:51:02 <katp32>	?????
Dec 11 18:51:06 <Elw3>	yes that too
Dec 11 18:51:11 <katp32>	my GPU is only at 34C, and my CPU is only at 36C
Dec 11 18:51:17 <katp32>	why is some fan running full blast
Dec 11 18:51:28 <Elw3>	Fans are stupid mostly
Dec 11 18:51:44 <Elw3>	For a big chunk of devices you can even rip it out with no difference
Dec 11 18:51:58 <katp32>	well the GPU has it integrated directly :P
Dec 11 18:52:07 <katp32>	I wouldn't want to remove it in any case
Dec 11 18:52:15 <Elw3>	Is it at absolute full blast?
Dec 11 18:52:30 <katp32>	not anymore, was awhile ago (presumably it was actually hot awhile ago)
Dec 11 18:52:45 <koollman>	so it did its job ? :)
Dec 11 18:52:54 <katp32>	I'm not actually sure what fan it is, I just assumed GPU because the CPU fans are pretty good at calming down once the CPU is cool
Dec 11 18:52:57 <Elw3>	Some motherboards have a an error where it translates 0% usage to 100% usage
Dec 11 18:53:02 <katp32>	koollman: well yes but it's still going :P
Dec 11 18:53:25 <Elw3>	Eg mine, i cant set my fan to passive on the cpu port because if it reaches stalling speed it goes full blast.
Dec 11 18:53:26 <katp32>	must've been REALLY hot last night for it to run for multiple hours..
Dec 11 18:53:31 <katp32>	okay now it's stopped
Dec 11 18:53:39 <katp32>	so yeah not as bad as last night I guess
Dec 11 18:53:54 <Elw3>	What kind of computer is this
Dec 11 18:53:55 <Elw3>	?
Dec 11 18:54:00 <katp32>	tower PC
Dec 11 18:54:31 <Elw3>	Stop the fan by hand and touch the coler directly
Dec 11 18:54:48 <katp32>	a Lenovo workstation specifically, built extremely cursed, it has eight slots for DDR4 but only one 16GiB stick installed :)
Dec 11 18:54:56 <katp32>	the other 7 slots are empty
Dec 11 18:55:01 <Elw3>	Estimate if the shown temp matches the cooler temp
Dec 11 18:55:08 <katp32>	genius PC building at Lenovo :P
Dec 11 18:55:46 <katp32>	(to be fair I love everything about this machine, except for that. and the fact that they shipped me a broken Intel Wireless card that causes sporadic hard resets if I don't use it with the IOMMU)
Dec 11 18:56:05 <Elw3>	Sounds like a mess...
Dec 11 18:56:43 <katp32>	the only other problem is I have no bluetooth, because when debugging the wireless card issues I unplugged the internal USB cable for bluetooth, and then, ah, misplaced, the cable
Dec 11 18:56:48 <Elw3>	I get a new computer too tomorrow, some used office mini computer.
Dec 11 18:56:53 <katp32>	not like I use bluetooth anyways lol
Dec 11 18:56:59 <katp32>	but I would really like to find that cable :/
Dec 11 18:57:02 <Elw3>	Ryzen 5, only 90 bucks.
Dec 11 18:57:10 <katp32>	oh I LOVE my Threadripper
Dec 11 18:57:15 <katp32>	24 threads, it's amazing
Dec 11 18:57:30 <katp32>	although I heard of someone the other day who had an even better one, something like 64 threads?
Dec 11 18:57:35 <Elw3>	Thats ryzen 7 i think, is it?
Dec 11 18:57:47 <katp32>	no I have a Threadripper Pro, 12 cores 24 threads
Dec 11 18:58:00 <katp32>	have the Ryzens gotten a thread count that high already?
Dec 11 18:58:05 <Elw3>	I have no idea how these are named.
Dec 11 18:58:15 <katp32>	lol same
Dec 11 18:58:30 <katp32>	I have at least learned all the AMD GPU names now :P
Dec 11 18:58:38 <katp32>	still know nothing about Nvidia's insane naming system though
Dec 11 18:58:41 <Elw3>	It really makes no sense to follow naming schemes.
Dec 11 18:58:43 <bcn>	i need an app recommendation for taking notes during meetings.  I record audio and take notes and would love if I could type [ctrl]+[t] or some other key combination to insert the current time with seconds
Dec 11 18:59:08 <Elw3>	You could code that easily bcn
Dec 11 18:59:16 <Elw3>	But premade...
Dec 11 18:59:20 <katp32>	it would be nice if they just used the names for the underlying architecture, but "GCN3" doesn't sound as nice as "Polaris", "GCN4" doesn't sound as nice as "Vega", etc
Dec 11 18:59:38 <bcn>	Elw3: in what?  gedit?  vim?
Dec 11 18:59:42 <Elw3>	All hail the Bulldozer arch
Dec 11 18:59:47 <Armand>	GCN# definitely sounds better.
Dec 11 18:59:49 <mutante>	bcn: emacs ?::
Dec 11 19:00:15 <Elw3>	No i mean the sound recording part bcn, you better not have these two features togetehr in one thing.
Dec 11 19:00:18 <katp32>	Armand: except after GCN4 they changed it to RDNA :P
Dec 11 19:00:26 <katp32>	but to be fair that's because they completely redid the architecture
Dec 11 19:00:27 <marcopolo>	If i understand correctly , when you uninstall a flatpak you dont have to worry about cleaning your system, all user generated files and all dependencies are automatically removed upon uninstalling the flatpak?
Dec 11 19:00:45 <katp32>	(still need to get myself a fancier new RDNA card >.<)
Dec 11 19:00:56 <Armand>	Elw3: "I have no respect for this language".... Typical American!
Dec 11 19:00:57 <Armand>	:P
Dec 11 19:01:03 <bcn>	Elw3: why not?  ideally my notes would be sync'd to audio. so I could more easily go back and make minutes later
Dec 11 19:01:03 <Elw3>	Oo
Dec 11 19:01:10 <katp32>	Americans _never_ had respect for the English language lol
Dec 11 19:01:19 <Armand>	Or the tea.
Dec 11 19:01:32 <Elw3>	Daheck is an american?
Dec 11 19:01:42 <Armand>	A person from the America.
Dec 11 19:01:48 *	ski . o O ( who's Daheck ? )
Dec 11 19:01:49 <Elw3>	So a hispanic?
Dec 11 19:01:52 <Armand>	mebe
Dec 11 19:02:04 <katp32>	from the US specifically, please god do not mix the Canadians or Mexicans or Cubans or etc into this
Dec 11 19:02:07 <katp32>	- signed, a Canadian
Dec 11 19:02:20 <Armand>	Pfft... Y'all just Americans with a funny accent.
Dec 11 19:02:21 <katp32>	we're not associated with _them_
Dec 11 19:02:42 *	stuffandthings waves to katp32
Dec 11 19:02:47 <katp32>	hi
Dec 11 19:02:48 <Elw3>	From the Us tdhe correct term is Murican
Dec 11 19:02:49 <stuffandthings>	hi from ontario
Dec 11 19:03:11 <katp32>	used to live in Ottawa, too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer though. living in Vancouver now :3
Dec 11 19:03:19 <mutante>	American? You mean the United States, right?  Yea, the United States of Mexico
Dec 11 19:03:57 <katp32>	anyways I have to shut down my computer to clean all the mushrooms spores out of it, hopefully that will improve the thermals. at least it will reduce my odds of getting pneumonia again. bbiab o/
Dec 11 19:04:09 *	Elw3 genuinely wonders if anyone thinks they are murican.
Dec 11 19:04:31 <Armand>	Which reminds me.. I should dismantle my ThinkPad for a good clean and fresh thermal paste.
Dec 11 19:06:04 <Elw3>	My english in school was pretty bad actually. So what you read here is someone with very little english skills.
Dec 11 19:06:31 <Elw3>	A tad worse and i speak as bad as a murican.
Dec 11 19:08:14 <Armand>	"I understand 3 languages; English, Bad English.. and American."
Dec 11 19:08:30 <stuffandthings>	lol
Dec 11 19:09:45 <janos>	i'm still waiting for the english to speak english properly
Dec 11 19:10:23 <Armand>	*Some* of us do.
Dec 11 19:11:01 <janos>	adding 'r' to words that in 'a' sounds is probably the closests to making me homicidal as it can get
Dec 11 19:11:32 <janos>	the other day i heard a brit say "pneumonia" but it was "new moan yer"
Dec 11 19:11:39 <g0z>	Bra == braer
Dec 11 19:11:53 <stuffandthings>	beta = bater :P
Dec 11 19:12:17 <akik>	mycket bra
Dec 11 19:13:21 <ski>	obviously you should pronounce the ending "r"s audibly
Dec 11 19:13:53 <janos>	yes
Dec 11 19:13:55 <Khaytsus>	My wifes family adds "S" to thinks that don't have it, removes it from things that do.  "Walmart" = "Walmarts" etc.
Dec 11 19:14:03 <janos>	and those turn into 'a's sometimes. i just don't get it
Dec 11 19:14:08 <ski>	"maths" ?
Dec 11 19:14:23 <Khaytsus>	No, but..  that's a thing.  Brits insist on saying "maths" ;)
Dec 11 19:14:24 <janos>	i get maths - short for mathematics
Dec 11 19:14:34 <janos>	i don't personally say it, but still
Dec 11 19:14:43 <Armand>	Khaytsus: Because it's correct.
Dec 11 19:14:46 <stuffandthings>	Khaytsus: russel peters joked that trinis do that
Dec 11 19:14:57 <Khaytsus>	Who?  who?
Dec 11 19:15:18 <akik>	aluminIum :)
Dec 11 19:15:31 <Khaytsus>	al you many um
Dec 11 19:15:38 <stuffandthings>	russel peters, canadian comedian, trini = someone from trinidad
Dec 11 19:15:38 <Armand>	O_o
Dec 11 19:15:52 <Armand>	I can clearly tell who's never spoken to a Brit... lmao
Dec 11 19:16:00 *	ski idly wonders why english people say "Krakatoa" instead of "Krakatao"
Dec 11 19:16:01 <Khaytsus>	Armand: who?  Heh
Dec 11 19:16:13 <Khaytsus>	Besides, brits have many dialects too
Dec 11 19:16:17 <Armand>	;)
Dec 11 19:16:33 <Armand>	Ok.... a *proper* Brit... not some unemployable Brummy. :P
Dec 11 19:16:53 <ski>	(and "cocoa" instead of "cacao". "areopage" instead of "aeropage", &c.)
Dec 11 19:16:55 <Khaytsus>	Yeah I wasa picturing you in some nice burberry
Dec 11 19:17:01 <Armand>	Ugggghhhh
Dec 11 19:17:07 <Khaytsus>	innit
Dec 11 19:17:10 <Armand>	No.
Dec 11 19:17:37 <Armand>	Today it's blue jeans, white collared shirt, black tie. :)
Dec 11 19:17:53 <ski>	my condoleances
Dec 11 19:17:59 <Khaytsus>	I'm in sweat pants and a thermal sleep shirt :P
Dec 11 19:18:02 <akik>	i like the sean connery accent
Dec 11 19:18:03 <Armand>	Sorry for having a job. :P
Dec 11 19:18:16 <Khaytsus>	I'm on a conference call right now :P

Dec 11 19:42:15 <Guest68>	peace out brethern
Dec 11 19:43:26 <stuffandthings>	peace out, a-town
Dec 11 19:44:07 <Guest78>	I want to know the temperature of my CPU and DIMMs. https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/lm_sensors gives some instructions but i'm not seeing any results from `sensors` that look like CPU or RAM: https://bpa.st/6PFQ . What am I missing?
Dec 11 19:44:48 <Jester01>	the cpu is right there
Dec 11 19:44:55 <Jester01>	lines 21-23
Dec 11 19:45:15 <ananke>	temperature of DIMMs? that's not a standard feature you can count on
Dec 11 19:45:32 <janos>	brightness is there though. but always dim
Dec 11 19:46:09 <mutante>	the wifi device has a temperature?heh, surprised
Dec 11 19:46:15 <Guest78>	ok thanks
Dec 11 19:47:02 <akik>	it's hot when you download media from the internet
Dec 11 19:49:57 <ski>	(maybe it's hotswapping)
Dec 11 19:50:21 <neoncortex>	does it download faster when heated?  Like old cars?
Dec 11 19:50:50 <ski>	you wouldn't now .. would you ?
Dec 11 19:50:52 <akik>	you wouldn't download an okd car
Dec 11 19:51:10 <neoncortex>	I would.  The problem is that it seems I cant.
Dec 11 19:51:22 <ski>	even a heated one ?
Dec 11 19:51:31 *	Jester01 forgot to take the food out of the freezer, do you suppose downloading over wifi would make it hot? :D
Dec 11 19:51:34 <akik>	from thingieverse?
Dec 11 19:51:39 <neoncortex>	specially a heated one.
Dec 11 19:52:45 <ski>	hm, in a book here, there was a "Telebrumapparat", with which they could transfer buns, and coffee, by pouring it into a funnel, at the railroad station, transferred over the wires to the receiving end at the running train
Dec 11 19:53:50 <ski>	i guess since the hot coffee worked, a heated car might, too, at least piecemeal
Dec 11 19:54:15 <mutante>	you wouldn't download a bun
Dec 11 19:54:23 <neoncortex>	but, seriously, what was that last debian update?  Does anyone have more details what the problem was?  Im looking here: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1057843 .  I used that kernel for like a day ¬_¬
Dec 11 19:54:24 <akik>	i like big buns
Dec 11 19:54:34 <ski>	perhaps a donut, or a Klein bottle, though
Dec 11 19:55:02 <akik>	was it berlin that a had a vast pneumatic system for message delivery?
Dec 11 19:55:28 <ski>	hm. i've heard of that, but can't recall where it was
Dec 11 19:55:44 <ski>	.. i think at least some large offices or factories may've used that. perhaps hotels, too ?
Dec 11 19:55:51 <mutante>	satanic kernel eats files. kernel 6.1.66 fixes the issue
Dec 11 19:56:29 <neoncortex>	mutante: so far I think I did not lose any files.
Dec 11 19:57:20 <akik>	yes it was berlin
Dec 11 19:57:41 <neoncortex>	so this is for real?  Like, they really had pneumatic delivery?  I thought it was a retrofuturistic fantasy.
Dec 11 19:57:59 <akik>	yes
Dec 11 19:58:10 <ioria>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohrpost_in_Berlin
Dec 11 19:58:45 <neoncortex>	thats amazing.
Dec 11 19:59:05 <akik>	zeppelin was kinda futuristic too
Dec 11 19:59:52 <akik>	if you haven't watched babylon berlin tv show, warmly suggested
Dec 11 20:00:18 <mdogg>	Is that a new Star Trek series?
Dec 11 20:01:16 <akik>	mdogg: it's a police tv show about 1920-1940 era
Dec 11 20:02:23 <Linux^>	anybody here actively contributes to the linux kernel repo?
Dec 11 20:02:31 <mdogg>	Berlin was a bleak place during the 1920-1940 era.
Dec 11 20:03:03 <neoncortex>	I barely can write programs to my use.  I think my brain are not cut for the kernel development.
Dec 11 20:03:20 <hodapp>	that's fine! just write kernel modules that you don't plan to use.
Dec 11 20:03:28 <neoncortex>	I can work on that, but meh xD
Dec 11 20:03:28 <mdogg>	I'm sure some people in here do, Linux^.
Dec 11 20:03:29 <akik>	mdogg: yes it's shown in babylon berlin
Dec 11 20:03:53 <hodapp>	my kernel hacking has been minimal. haven't had much need for it
Dec 11 20:04:10 <rlikon>	greets
Dec 11 20:04:22 <stuffandthings>	word up
Dec 11 20:04:32 <mutante>	with each kernel patch the beard grows an inch
Dec 11 20:04:34 <rlikon>	what are ppl's opinion about next kernel release ominous version?? 6.6.6
Dec 11 20:04:49 <neoncortex>	I hope it works.
Dec 11 20:04:54 <janos>	^^
Dec 11 20:04:57 <rlikon>	i'll definately skip that one
Dec 11 20:05:13 <stuffandthings>	6.6.anything has ben problematic for me
Dec 11 20:05:19 <stuffandthings>	*been
Dec 11 20:05:30 <rlikon>	I get a feeling it won't even be released
Dec 11 20:05:31 <stuffandthings>	i hope 666 fixes it
Dec 11 20:05:52 <rlikon>	or they'll find a cheap excuse to skip it quickly
Dec 11 20:06:01 <espresso>	pneumatic delivery... Brazil? :P  Digressing a moment to mention life-changing masterpieces, The Lives of Others. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZEUw4F3pEA </ot>
Dec 11 20:06:10 <stuffandthings>	too bad 6.6.6 missed dooms 30th birthay by a day or two
Dec 11 20:06:38 <mdogg>	Has it been 30 years already?
Dec 11 20:06:42 <neoncortex>	espresso: Brazil barely have a normal delivery, a pneumatic one is something out of reach xD
Dec 11 20:06:52 <stuffandthings>	it has
Dec 11 20:06:54 <espresso>	neoncortex: I meant the movie Brazil. lol
Dec 11 20:07:03 <neoncortex>	oh.

Dec 11 20:09:33 <mdogg>	I'm running Linux version 6.6.2-1-default and it works great.
Dec 11 20:09:38 <rlikon>	mutante: this is what will most likely happen, it's time to announce a normal revision, they will hold as many patches as possible. Then announce 6.6.6 with ONE or two patches, and *immediately* announce 6.6.7 with hundredrs of patches to discourage 6.6.6 downloads/usage.
Dec 11 20:10:17 <mutante>	In 1989, Nancy and Ronald Reagan, when moving to their home in the Bel-Air section of Los Angeles after the latter left presidency of the United States that same year, had its address—666 St. Cloud Road—changed to 668 St. Cloud Road.[79][80] Some comedians quickly characterised their new address as "the Neighbour of the Beast".[

Dec 11 20:12:54 <mdogg>	It would have to be in a place like Bel Air, mutante.  I ain't moving to Lucifer Lane in Pokyville, Alabama.

Dec 17 12:36:57 <wigums>	mornin
Dec 17 12:38:02 <The_Blode>	Good morning guys
Dec 17 12:39:28 <The_Blode>	Is there any way in Linux to detect whether an optical disc drive has a CD-ROM audio disc inserted or a DVD movie inserted? Thank you.
Dec 17 12:39:53 <wigums>	sure. play it
Dec 17 12:39:54 <hexnewbie>	Yes, there is
Dec 17 12:42:58 <The_Blode>	Thank you hexnewbie
Dec 17 12:43:47 <tarel2>	Do any of you have experience running Linux as a phone operating system? I don't mean like Android either.
Dec 17 12:44:18 <phogg>	tarel2: I used to use an n900 and an n9, both very nice Debian-based phones.
Dec 17 12:44:47 <phogg>	there were some driver issues so you had to cycle the cellular interface now and then or it would lose connectivity
Dec 17 12:44:48 <tarel2>	I've heard of both of those.
Dec 17 12:44:57 <hexnewbie>	Well, Maemo is far from being Drbian-based. It's less Debian than OpenSUSE is RHEL
Dec 17 12:45:00 <phogg>	options these days are limited, sadly
Dec 17 12:45:25 <phogg>	hexnewbie: maemo today is not Debian-based. At the time you could open xterm, run apt-get, and install .deb files.
Dec 17 12:45:27 <hexnewbie>	Oh the options are plentiful, they just all suck
Dec 17 12:45:31 <tarel2>	I have a pine phone pro, There's about 10 active distributions on its page
Dec 17 12:45:59 <hexnewbie>	phogg: I still can. But it's not Debian-based at all
Dec 17 12:46:02 <phogg>	I have a pine phone which I could never get to OTA update. I need to flash it, I think, with an up to date version.
Dec 17 12:46:29 <phogg>	hexnewbie: Call it what you like. It uses .deb packages and apt. Technically Ubuntu is also not "Debian-based", but it's as near as makes no odds.
Dec 17 12:46:33 <tarel2>	I experienced quite a bit that my self.
Dec 17 12:46:48 <hexnewbie>	tarel2: Manjaro Phosh would be the first to try (Mobian has less issues out of the box on PPPro, but is seriously outdated)
Dec 17 12:46:49 <silly>	even worse that you kind of need android for mobile banking, public transport, whatsapp and all those funny, essential apps like soundcloud, spotify, the app for the washing machine and almost everything else
Dec 17 12:46:54 <phogg>	I recall hearing maemo was moving to RPM after merging with whatever Intel was backing.
Dec 17 12:47:19 <phogg>	silly: most of those don't sound essential.
Dec 17 12:47:36 <phogg>	I don't do business with anyone that requires a cell phone app and doesn't offer a web-based method.
Dec 17 12:47:48 <wigums>	i use my phone for making calls
Dec 17 12:47:52 <hexnewbie>	tarel2: Actually, make sure you have Tow Boot, check out which keystroke is used to boot from SD card, and prepare three cards to check which works with least issues for you
Dec 17 12:48:02 <silly>	phogg they become essential when you get used to use them
Dec 17 12:48:06 <phogg>	wigums: making calls and (sometimes) looking things up
Dec 17 12:48:09 <phogg>	silly: don't do that, then
Dec 17 12:48:14 <silly>	2l8
Dec 17 12:48:15 <wigums>	sure
Dec 17 12:48:17 <hexnewbie>	tarel2: Options to check would be Mobian, Manjaro Phosh and Manjaro Plasma.
Dec 17 12:49:23 <hexnewbie>	tarel2: And things that may be broken (for me) to test first are: modem returning after suspend, modem not crashing, and audio volume that other people talking to you hear you with
Dec 17 12:49:24 <wigums>	if i lived in the city id use my phone more but i live in the woods where there are no uber no taxis no food delivery no nothin
Dec 17 12:49:38 <tarel23>	Tow boot is absolutely awesome. I love switching between the SD card and the internal memory.
Dec 17 12:50:57 <Blohsh>	04:05 PM <n4dir_> you use the systems config file or changed it for the user?
Dec 17 12:50:57 <Blohsh>	04:05 PM <n4dir_> did you try with another user?
Dec 17 12:51:05 <Blohsh>	same with another user and no i did not change anything
Dec 17 12:53:05 <akik>	Blohsh: you can just reply to somebody like this nick: message
Dec 17 12:53:25 <Blohsh>	ok
Dec 17 13:11:13 <velix>	Why is there no ~/.ssh/ssh.d on Linux? I have multiple private keys ...
Dec 17 13:11:40 <selckin>	ssh-agent
Dec 17 13:12:01 <velix>	selckin: I tried it, but it wasn't there on reboot or re-login.
Dec 17 13:12:09 <velix>	selckin: I've ended up with setting my own sshconfig
Dec 17 13:12:23 <velix>	might be the best solution
Dec 17 13:12:47 <selckin>	you put ssh-add ~/.ssh/* with the ssh-agent
Dec 17 13:13:07 <xx>	I just make a separate keys directory in that dir
Dec 17 13:17:53 <akik>	why is there no velix.d ?
Dec 17 13:18:19 <xx>	why is there no /.d ?
Dec 17 13:20:30 <MrElendig>	or use a persistent agent
Dec 17 13:20:37 <MrElendig>	e.g. keepassxc
Dec 17 13:21:06 <MrElendig>	also you can have a ~/.ssh/ssh.d/ if you like, nothing is stopping you from doing so
Dec 17 13:21:41 <velix>	akik: Oh mate, I missed you ... not :D
Dec 17 13:22:11 <velix>	MrElendig: hrhr, but I guess ~/.ssh/ssh./d won't be read :D
Dec 17 13:22:29 <velix>	selckin: ssh only reads the defauld id_... name.
Dec 17 13:22:41 <velix>	selckin: I can't do "id_github"
Dec 17 13:22:50 <selckin>	if you know everything why even ask
Dec 17 13:23:00 <velix>	selckin: I ask *why*.
Dec 17 13:23:07 <velix>	History reasons? Security reasons?
Dec 17 13:23:09 <selckin>	read what i siad again
Dec 17 13:23:18 <velix>	"you put ssh-add ~/.ssh/* with the ssh-agent"
Dec 17 13:23:24 <velix>	Did so, works for the current session only.
Dec 17 13:23:39 <selckin>	then you ddin't setup ssh-agent properly
Dec 17 13:23:49 <wigums>	i just use the same key for everystuff
Dec 17 13:23:52 <velix>	selckin: Yep, I didn't set up anything.
Dec 17 13:23:56 <velix>	wigums: Yeah, that's how it ends.
Dec 17 13:24:00 <wigums>	lol
Dec 17 13:24:06 <velix>	That's why I thought: "WHY isn't there a .d"
Dec 17 13:24:14 <wigums>	well all my stuff is physically right here
Dec 17 13:24:21 <selckin>	well the reason is that people use ssh-agent
Dec 17 13:24:23 <selckin>	heh
Dec 17 13:24:47 <velix>	selckin: Nah, I'll go for cat ~/.ssh/config
Dec 17 13:24:50 <velix>	erm without cat ;)
Dec 17 13:25:11 <selckin>	velix: fine, you can solve it anyway you want
Dec 17 13:25:38 <hexnewbie>	SSH has no issues with multiple key files, effort required effectively the same as using the defautls
Dec 17 13:26:04 <velix>	hexnewbie: but without a config file or an agent, it looks for the standard keys only.
Dec 17 13:26:13 <hexnewbie>	Well... Yes.
Dec 17 13:26:28 <selckin>	do you have 70iq or something
Dec 17 13:26:39 <MrElendig>	velix: ssh does include directives
Dec 17 13:27:31 <MrElendig>	velix: include ~/.ssh/ssh.d/*
Dec 17 13:27:56 <velix>	selckin: What's with the kick below the belt now? Users have been kicked for this in the past.
Dec 17 13:28:28 <velix>	selckin: Just because someone is only so familiar with 70s techniques doesn't mean you have to insult them.
Dec 17 13:28:30 <velix>	idiot
Dec 17 13:28:31 <hexnewbie>	Can even put them in ~/.ssh/hosts/%h/id_ed25519
Dec 17 13:28:33 <MrElendig>	velix: there are seven multiple tools to manage ssh which uses this feature
Dec 17 13:28:44 <selckin>	velix: well i stand by my statement
Dec 17 13:29:18 <velix>	hexnewbie: sounds interesting, thanks.
Dec 17 13:29:30 <velix>	MrElendig: I don't think ssh will look for all the keys to find the right one.
Dec 17 13:29:36 <hexnewbie>	velix: Note, it's still not a default, since it's fully configurable
Dec 17 13:30:41 <hexnewbie>	Be warned that having too many keys to try can have side-effects, say, I've had cases where liberally configured fail2ban would just ban you before you get to the right key
Dec 17 13:30:53 <akik>	velix: hugs and wishes
Dec 17 13:31:07 <MrElendig>	velix: you drop in a snipplet along with the key which tells ssh to use said key for that specific host
Dec 17 13:31:33 <velix>	MrElendig: Actually then my use of ~/.ssh/config gives me more control, I guess.
Dec 17 13:31:33 <MrElendig>	hence the include directive
Dec 17 13:31:38 <MrElendig>	its for including configs, not keys
Dec 17 13:32:05 <velix>	MrElendig: This works: Host github.com
Dec 17 13:32:05 <velix>	    User git
Dec 17 13:32:05 <velix>	    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_ed25519
Dec 17 13:32:16 <velix>	hexnewbie: Yeah, but 1 key per server is fine for me.
Dec 17 13:32:29 <MrElendig>	1 key per server is imo kinda silly for most use cases
Dec 17 13:32:51 <velix>	MrElendig: Yeah, but github.com is not under my control.
Dec 17 13:32:56 <hexnewbie>	velix: So?
Dec 17 13:33:02 <velix>	For servers under my control, 1 key is fine.
Dec 17 13:33:12 <velix>	(at all)
Dec 17 13:33:15 <MrElendig>	you work at gh?
Dec 17 13:33:21 <xx>	MrElendig: I like 1 key per server, it makes everything neater, and it's cheap to generate
Dec 17 13:33:44 <hexnewbie>	velix: Having the same key for all servers that you connect to, even those that aren't under your control, isn't a problem as you have good policy regarding known_hosts
Dec 17 13:34:06 <MrElendig>	and limiting the amount of keys lets you use a hardware token
Dec 17 13:34:29 <hexnewbie>	That is, you are slightly careful when connecting to a previously unknown host and verify it, and extremely careful when a host key changes (disclaimer: github did recently-ish)
Dec 17 13:35:54 <hexnewbie>	Host keys already authenticate the hosts, the only (as far as my experience goes) use of giving them separate client keys is that this way you ensure a new host you add to your list is not actually one of your old ones you already have (but if that's a concern, you can always check manually, so still no use)
Dec 17 13:36:01 <velix>	MrElendig: I have lots to do with sysadmin and really NONE has a yubikey or such.
Dec 17 13:36:15 <velix>	MrElendig: They pray to use one... but none do
Dec 17 13:36:41 <velix>	Like OTP is all over the internet, while FIDO or Fingerprint is used rarely (on computers)
Dec 17 13:36:41 <hexnewbie>	Oh, and paranoia about your key identity, I guess.
Dec 17 13:37:12 <hexnewbie>	(For identification/privacy fears, not security ones)
Dec 17 13:37:33 <velix>	I mean have a look at the GPG community. They tell you to have like 4-5 different subkeys.
Dec 17 13:38:48 <AndyCap>	 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key.d/%h_id_file
Dec 17 13:38:51 <hexnewbie>	And what's the reasoning they give for that?
Dec 17 13:39:57 <velix>	hexnewbie: I guess security, can't remember... but all tutorials do so ;)
Dec 17 13:40:06 <velix>	AndyCap: Yeah, that's a resonable solution.
Dec 17 13:40:27 <hexnewbie>	Well, “security, can't remember” makes it cargo cult security.
Dec 17 13:41:29 <hexnewbie>	Especially if you blindly transpose a rule from GPG keys to SSH keys without understanding its purpose (following a rule you don't yet understand is probably a good idea, blindly transferring it to wider situations might not be)
Dec 17 13:42:23 <hexnewbie>	The only really good reason I found for having multiple client keys was so obscure that literally nobody else but me has ran into the issue.
Dec 17 13:42:59 <velix>	hexnewbie: The funny thing: Yubikey and Nitrokey are limited in key amount. So if you put 5 subkeys on it, you only have 5 slots left. At least at Nitrokey.
Dec 17 13:43:09 <hexnewbie>	The only bad thing sharing that key between gitlab.com and github.com is that they may learn that both keys belong to the same person
Dec 17 13:44:07 <MrElendig>	there are an argument for certain use cases where you have critical servers and use seperate hardware tokens for each
Dec 17 13:44:19 <MrElendig>	but if you are just stuffing all your private keys into the same storage anyway
Dec 17 13:44:34 <MrElendig>	anyone who gets access to one probably also has access to the rest, so you ahve to replace every key anyway
Dec 17 13:44:56 <MrElendig>	and audit all the hosts
Dec 17 13:45:28 <MrElendig>	(when it comes to the "if the key gets compromised only one host is affected" argument which is commonly used)
Dec 17 13:45:35 <hexnewbie>	Ah yes, I specifically use a separate key for work. Just so that I need to explicitly add it to an agent, unlock it with a separate passphrase, so that when I'm doing home stuff I am not “authorized” to work servers
Dec 17 13:46:05 <hexnewbie>	Kind of stopped having any value since I started working from home, though
Dec 17 13:46:35 <MrElendig>	should have a dedicated machine for working from home
Dec 17 13:46:48 <MrElendig>	paid for by the employer of course
Dec 17 13:47:01 <hexnewbie>	I had. I was using the desktop at work. Two power outages and I was no longer using it.
Dec 17 13:48:21 <MrElendig>	we had a huge company close down for over a week due to them deciding to save on money by having the work from home people use their own private machines :p
Dec 17 13:48:35 <MrElendig>	only cost them about 80 million euros
Dec 17 13:48:59 <MrElendig>	a bargin compared to the 100k or so it would cost to get them all dedicated hardware
Dec 17 13:49:50 <hexnewbie>	Well, anyone at work was already bringing their personal laptop to the office to work from, since the company machines were too slow to even run a web browser
Dec 17 13:50:43 <MrElendig>	the breach was from someone using their old vista machine full of fun stuff
Dec 17 13:50:51 <MrElendig>	great sucsess
Dec 17 13:51:06 <hexnewbie>	I got an update to an i5-2400 4 years back, which is kind of decent, though 😃

janv. 17 22:09:45 <x86>	bindi: lolol
janv. 17 22:09:55 <Disconsented>	Dragon? Dammmnnn
janv. 17 22:10:11 <epony>	use nicknames as keywords and spawn multiple irc connections, that counts
janv. 17 22:10:39 <epony>	then you'll get highlights working well for your "bad" communications client
janv. 17 22:12:15 <epony>	alternatively, you use the correctly designed application and solve your requirements, that makes a choice instead of you about what computer form factor and operating system and applied programming you need
janv. 17 22:12:28 <Everything>	Hi all. Not want to start flame war, but I look for RHEL/CentOS alternative. What is more stable - oracle linux, alma or rocky?
janv. 17 22:13:12 <epony>	and, we're back into the premises of generally programmable computers, operating systems for them, and kernels and applied programs for them, one of which is Linux
janv. 17 22:13:30 <epony>	Everything, depends, what requirements do you have?
janv. 17 22:14:04 <Everything>	epony: webserver, exim... nothing special. I just want something slowly updated and stable
janv. 17 22:14:05 <Disconsented>	Depends what you mean by stable, if you mean the true definition then its trivial to look up release history for versions & packages
janv. 17 22:14:19 <epony>	the trivial answer is "none" but you might want to check again with the upstream distribution package manager and its uses in distributions
janv. 17 22:14:29 <Everything>	Disconsented: thanks for the idea
janv. 17 22:14:35 <phogg>	Everything: I would not touch anything related to Oracle unless there was dire need.
janv. 17 22:14:35 <Disconsented>	I wouldn't touch oracle anything FWIW
janv. 17 22:14:48 <epony>	in short, you're selecting the RPM distributions and have a large variety to pick from
janv. 17 22:14:58 <Juest>	apparently xpra packages are oddly outdated in some senses
janv. 17 22:15:06 <phogg>	Everything: that said, I have no experience with post-CentOS alternatives. Can't make a positive recommendation, just a generalized negative recommendation.
janv. 17 22:15:42 <epony>	Everything, Exim is from Debian, that's a hint for you
janv. 17 22:16:21 <epony>	web servers come from Apache software foundation (Java) or Nginx (independent)
janv. 17 22:16:21 <Everything>	phogg: why oracle is so bad, they can suddenly stop all free stuff?
janv. 17 22:16:39 <epony>	Everything, so your applications are picking instead of you
janv. 17 22:17:01 <epony>	and more importantly, what dynamic programming language, if it's PHP it makes choices over the web server
janv. 17 22:17:20 <epony>	see, packaging is what distributions are about
janv. 17 22:18:00 <epony>	your "stable" requirement is in conflict with a "rapidly developed" dynamic programming language (for use as a language server) or a dynamic web service (or a platform for applications)
janv. 17 22:18:00 <phogg>	Everything: history. If you are familiar with how people distrust e.g. Microsoft, with Oracle it's currently worse.
janv. 17 22:18:15 <phogg>	Everything: they have a history of screwing over open source projects and generally being anti-social

janv. 18 07:30:51 <icy_hot>	what's your question?
janv. 18 07:32:17 <pisceswolf96>	@icy_hot, I was wondering if books like (Asghar Ghori and Michael Jang) are enough to prepare for and pass the RHCSA exam, or if I need to take the courses provided by Redhat?
janv. 18 07:32:26 <blinux>	Does anyone know if any major linux distros other than Opensuse have the Snapper Grub menu setup by default?
janv. 18 07:33:34 <_vanessa>	I think the RHCSA is easier than RHCE. Atleast thats what I felt.
janv. 18 07:33:35 <icy_hot>	i'm also thinking of studying for RHCSA, but not sure when though.
janv. 18 07:34:32 <pisceswolf96>	@_vanessa, I don't really feel that it is that difficult, just the fact that it is my first certificate and the fact that it's a hands-on.
janv. 18 07:34:56 <_vanessa>	In general, I think you won't need RH's course to pass the RHCSA.
janv. 18 07:35:12 <pisceswolf96>	@icy_hot, I'm currently preparing for it, if you want a study buddy then I'm here
janv. 18 07:36:07 <pisceswolf96>	@_vanessa, awesome, Michael Jang's make it sounds as if I needed to supplement his book with RH courses, but good to hear that I don't need to take them
janv. 18 07:37:44 <icy_hot>	pisceswolf96 i've never heard of people passing or failing certifications becuase they chose the right or wrong resources(except for braindumps. i never recommend braindumps). The RHCSA outlines the kind of questions you should be expecting, so as long as the book covers that and is up to date, it should be good for studying
janv. 18 07:39:31 <pisceswolf96>	@icy_hot, They are quite up to date, Michael Jang's book is less than 1 month old, and he provides 2 sample exams. Again I think I'm overthinking it just because it's my first certificate. Thank you for your time
janv. 18 07:42:58 <icy_hot>	No problem. I'm thinking of taking mine by the end of the year. So far, I passed Security+ and Linux+ and have never used any official study guides. Just practice tests from percipio
janv. 18 07:45:51 <pisceswolf96>	@icy_hot, Awesome, glad to hear that they are not as hard as I made them to be.
janv. 18 07:49:16 <Norkle>	:]
janv. 18 08:18:01 <BlueyHealer>	I would never get a cert by myself because they're all paid. Hope uni would be enough for a first job and then I'd be able to get through with some grind somehow.
janv. 18 08:20:05 <rascul>	certs can be good for resumes
janv. 18 08:21:46 <rascul>	some certs are garbage and don't actually show any capacity of knowledge or ability, but i've heard the red hat ones can be good
janv. 18 08:22:07 <Fisher>	What certificates would be good to have?
janv. 18 08:22:44 <Fisher>	Is Red Hat very different from Debian?
janv. 18 08:22:56 <rascul>	is there a debian cert?
janv. 18 08:23:32 <rascul>	red hat has these ones   https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certifications
janv. 18 08:23:49 <Fisher>	I don't know if there are debian certificates
janv. 18 08:24:12 <BlueyHealer>	rascul, yea, but they're paid. I might get one, but only if the employer pays. They can get crazy expensive. Hope uni would get me through instead at first.

janv. 18 08:26:46 <rascul>	Fisher also package selection and sometimes a difference in how things are organized or how to utilize various tools to accomplish certain tasks
janv. 18 08:28:13 <BlueyHealer>	rascul, like, how bad of a difference have you seen?
janv. 18 08:28:19 <rascul>	BlueyHealer bad?
janv. 18 08:29:20 <rascul>	Fisher also distros differ in the update policies
janv. 18 08:30:13 <Fisher>	To practice, do you directly recommend redhat or fedora?
janv. 18 08:30:16 <rascul>	consider for example rhel vs arch they are very different in a lot of ways but at the core it's largely the same kernel with the same software
janv. 18 08:30:29 <icy_hot>	i would consider certs as some sort of investment. whether it helps you or not really depends on what kinda career you want to be on
janv. 18 08:30:31 <rascul>	by redhat do you mean rhel?
janv. 18 08:30:48 <icy_hot>	aren't they the same? ^
janv. 18 08:30:57 <n4dir>	"did you survive in IRC?" "Yes" "Ok, you are hired"
janv. 18 08:31:17 <rascul>	fedora is basically red hat
janv. 18 08:31:55 <rascul>	there's some weird organizational structure so it might not be technically red hat depending on how you look at it but it's red hat
janv. 18 08:34:23 <Fisher>	Are the certifications given by Redhat free?
janv. 18 08:34:27 <rascul>	no
janv. 18 08:34:30 <budlight>	IMB owns redhat now
janv. 18 08:34:41 <budlight>	IBM
janv. 18 08:34:42 <rascul>	best to get your employer to pay for the cert and course if possible
janv. 18 08:36:10 <rascul>	some us gov and i imagine other gov positions have certain cert requirements that would be worth looking into if you wanted a gov job
janv. 18 08:37:41 <rascul>	comptia certs are a joke but they were also some of the cheaper options if you just want to pad your resume
janv. 18 08:38:25 <icy_hot>	sadly i agree, but lots of gov jobs require them
janv. 18 08:39:00 <icy_hot>	they won't even look at you if you don't have certs like sec+
janv. 18 08:39:06 <rascul>	sec+ is a joke
janv. 18 08:39:23 <rascul>	i have that one
janv. 18 08:40:02 <rascul>	us army paid for the course and the test
janv. 18 08:40:04 <Guest0009>	hello
janv. 18 08:40:12 <rascul>	got some nice sleep during that course
janv. 18 08:40:13 <luna_>	hey
janv. 18 08:40:26 <n4dir>	that is why they call you The Joker
janv. 18 08:40:31 <rascul>	only got yelled at once
janv. 18 08:41:00 <rascul>	passed the test in 10 minutes almost asleep
janv. 18 08:41:03 <icy_hot>	Sec+ was my very first IT cert. Although it felt like a quiz on a company's AUP
janv. 18 08:41:16 <rascul>	perfect score
janv. 18 08:41:39 <Guest0009>	what do i do here
janv. 18 08:41:46 <rascul>	party like a rockstar
janv. 18 08:42:54 <n4dir>	but only because the radiostar was killed
janv. 18 08:43:12 <rascul>	i wanted to get a red hat cert just to see if they're any good like i heard they were but i never got around to it
janv. 18 08:43:13 <Guest0009>	do y'all just chat or exchange stuff like is this for a specific work group?
janv. 18 08:43:32 <velix>	n4dir: Did you know that Hans Zimmer was in the band during that time?
janv. 18 08:43:34 <rascul>	Guest0009 sometimes we chat and sometimes we help people with linux related issues
janv. 18 08:43:56 <n4dir>	velix: i didn't know that, and i wouldn't even know Zimmer if epony wouldn't have told me about him the other day.
janv. 18 08:44:03 <rascul>	the chat is often related to linux in some fashion
janv. 18 08:44:09 <rascul>	but not always
janv. 18 08:44:19 *	velix leaves
janv. 18 08:44:22 *	velix isn't welcome
janv. 18 08:44:24 <n4dir>	i'd even consider the chat kind of the backbone of the help. But it is not always clear
janv. 18 08:44:41 <rascul>	i guess velix needs to rake his leaves
janv. 18 08:44:59 <akik>	Guest0009: irc is serious business
janv. 18 08:45:00 <rascul>	there are machines to make that easier though
janv. 18 08:46:22 <Guest12>	hello
janv. 18 08:48:25 <akik>	n4dir: junkie xl is a movie composer too. he's on youtube
janv. 18 08:49:23 <rascul>	you're a tube
janv. 18 08:49:29 <n4dir>	akik: i will give it a try. After the third Miles Davis album i have enough of him
janv. 18 08:50:42 <n4dir>	i really liked the theme from Homeland, but forgot the composer. Seems to be well known to, besides to me
janv. 18 08:51:01 <luna_>	the deathbed vigil: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001vl9n
janv. 18 08:53:10 <akik>	n4dir: homeland the tv show?
janv. 18 08:53:31 <n4dir>	the series. i can't give any more info, i had to search.
janv. 18 08:53:55 <akik>	i watched the two first seasons of it
janv. 18 08:54:27 <n4dir>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tzvLr77Lec
janv. 18 08:54:33 <n4dir>	that is the theme
janv. 18 08:56:04 <akik>	not as memorable theme as hill street blues
janv. 18 08:57:52 <n4dir>	motherless brooklyn has nice music, assuming you are in jazz. Else it probably sucks big times
janv. 18 08:58:45 <akik>	i don't like jazz
janv. 18 08:59:26 <n4dir>	the good news: you are not alone with that
janv. 18 08:59:54 <n4dir>	the movie itself is nice too, but i am pretty sure people who can't stand jazz will not be able to enjoy it
janv. 18 08:59:55 <akik>	i hate black/doom meta and finnish rap
janv. 18 09:00:50 <n4dir>	i could try to hate it, but would first need to get to know it
janv. 18 09:00:52 <BlueyHealer>	Aren't even basic certs more than $100?
janv. 18 09:01:10 <akik>	letsencrypt gives out certs for free
janv. 18 09:01:34 <BlueyHealer>	I meant certs as in for job
janv. 18 09:01:45 <BlueyHealer>	The ones previously talked here about
janv. 18 09:04:32 <epony>	still pondering on certificate indpendence, it exists and is from the day 1 of the cretiong of the concept
janv. 18 09:05:58 <akik>	i have 0 of those certs
janv. 18 09:06:05 <epony>	free and gratis does not mean independent and unencumbered or "reliable" as in resilient and invulnerable to termination / cancellation of the certificate
janv. 18 09:06:13 <akik>	so i paid 0 €
janv. 18 09:06:37 <akik>	yuropeon pitch fork ----------------€
janv. 18 09:06:46 <epony>	nice
janv. 18 09:06:54 <epony>	euro-peon
janv. 18 09:07:27 <akik>	i sent a message to european central bank. they replied to me after two months :)
janv. 18 09:08:32 <epony>	I've helped a lot of people with both setting up the commercial certificates they purchased independently and through hosting with non-locking options and non-commercial free and self-issued certificates over the years, with excellent results in the interests of the people who needed these services
janv. 18 09:09:40 <epony>	both ways work, as long as people know what they need and have an expert advise and assist with the setup, the resuls are conclusively satisfactory
janv. 18 09:12:21 <epony>	but personally and in the network infrastructure outside the business frontend, both the businesses and I have never paid about it, so is a negative -0.= USD/EUR into this commercial exploitative scheme of the central browser and certificate authority issuer privilege group
janv. 18 09:13:03 <epony>	so it was only paid by people using the browsers with their own finance, for their own needs and dependence on that model of trust validation
janv. 18 09:13:56 <akik>	careful of the chatty chat
janv. 18 09:14:27 <epony>	and this is what can be recommended about certificates, use it independently and non-commercially as you can, or publicly with public free service if you can not make it work independently, and commercially, last chance with other people's money for their preferred technical setup independently and reliably too
janv. 18 09:14:29 <luna_>	i don't have a Librem so i can't use chatty
janv. 18 09:14:57 <epony>	that's a very brief note on the certs topic ;-)
janv. 18 09:17:29 <epony>	akik, technically it should have been ---=€ but it's like a crescent and rope slavery neck capture instrument of some religious military doctrine cult sects tokens so.. careful with the similarity to the sickle and hammer too ;-)
janv. 18 09:19:44 <akik>	my forefathers took care of the sickle and hammer problem

janv. 18 09:57:41 <akik>	it wouldn't be a password if he told you
janv. 18 09:58:01 <n4dir>	if you tell the password it is not a password anymore?
janv. 18 09:58:09 <rascul>	different uuid versions are more or less suitable for passwords
janv. 18 09:58:23 <akik>	a password is secret
janv. 18 09:58:35 <rascul>	so is my shoe size
janv. 18 09:58:51 <akik>	tattoo it on the bottom of your feet
janv. 18 09:58:52 <n4dir>	my password is user. But now it isn't anymore. What to do? Will i still be able to log in?
janv. 18 09:58:55 <epony>	if we have differences in opinion and need a bit more freeform talk we can always use the offtopic channel too, just don't lose patience and outlook on the important points of technology and its qualities, which diffrent people and use cases need diffrerently
janv. 18 09:58:59 <Blondie101010>	as epony said, enthropy will be quite low
janv. 18 09:59:27 <rascul>	depends on the uuid algorithm
janv. 18 09:59:31 <rascul>	and them stuffs
janv. 18 09:59:46 <akik>	my password is uuidgen
janv. 18 09:59:48 <rascul>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Versions
janv. 18 10:00:03 <akik>	damn it's changing all the time
janv. 18 10:00:03 <epony>	nice
janv. 18 10:00:22 <epony>	yes it's not a one style fits every use case
janv. 18 10:00:50 <epony>	but disk UUID are useful anyway, (DUID)
janv. 18 10:01:15 <Fisher>	Why does entropy decrease? I don't understand, if they are 128 random bits
janv. 18 10:01:28 <bookworm>	they aren't random
janv. 18 10:01:35 <selckin>	there aren't, the date is in there and some fixed bits
janv. 18 10:01:39 <rascul>	Fisher depends on the version how much random there is
janv. 18 10:01:43 <bookworm>	not all of it. It contains a machine ID, date...
janv. 18 10:01:43 <epony>	within a relatively practical narrow usage of non-likely to be repetitive / collision based use of the UUID concept, it's quite practical
janv. 18 10:02:31 <epony>	but the starting premises are different, enumerative vs entropic etc
janv. 18 10:02:39 <bookworm>	they are built to be least likely to collide, not to be as random as possible. For that simply... use a rng
janv. 18 10:03:08 <epony>	or a CSPRNG as the terminology gets improved over time
janv. 18 10:03:10 <rascul>	v4 is supposed to be random
janv. 18 10:09:43 <epony>	for some definition of randomness ;-)
janv. 18 10:10:26 <Angels>	Fisher, entropy is also a term from physics.
janv. 18 10:10:56 <Angels>	This note helped me to get into the subject, too.

janv. 18 10:50:13 <Black-Out>	i wanna install CISCO Ae2500 wifi adapter,but i don't know what drivers may i take
janv. 18 10:53:42 <epony>	search it in the manual pages or online forums
janv. 18 10:53:47 <epony>	section 4 is drivers
janv. 18 10:54:04 <epony>	check wikidevi too
janv. 18 10:54:19 <akik>	Black-Out: did you install it already?
janv. 18 10:54:32 <epony>	if the hardware is in the system it will auto-find drivers
janv. 18 10:56:37 <akik>	sometimes
janv. 18 10:59:06 <Black-Out>	drivers couldn't be installed i'm using KALI,and i don't really know if i can do this (is my principal and only OS)
janv. 18 10:59:45 <akik>	Black-Out: then check the hardware id with either "lspci -vnnk" or "lsusb -vt"
janv. 18 11:01:23 <Black-Out>	wow tnhx i dind know a *vt* argument i go try
janv. 18 11:01:43 <akik>	then some furious googling or duckducking
janv. 18 11:10:23 <OnkelTem>	Hi folks. How to enable masquerading on linux the easy way?
janv. 18 11:10:27 <akik>	lsusb just by itself shows the hardware id too
janv. 18 11:10:37 <OnkelTem>	Linux Ubunty 22.04 sorry
janv. 18 11:15:13 <akik>	OnkelTem: ufw doesn't do it?
janv. 18 11:16:40 <bookworm>	the easy way is the same as the hard way... modify your firewall config to do it
janv. 18 11:19:55 <akik>	OnkelTem: maybe: echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -i eth1 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
janv. 18 11:20:23 <akik>	as with everything linux: it depends
janv. 18 11:21:17 <bookworm>	with random input and output selectors for the lols? ;)
janv. 18 11:21:37 <akik>	can't do better with bad initial information
janv. 18 11:23:00 <OnkelTem>	akik: thanks. Yeah, using iptable directly looks like a good option
janv. 18 11:23:25 <OnkelTem>	akik: ufw - no, it fails at `ufw enable` on a fresh system
janv. 18 11:23:37 <akik>	OnkelTem: ok fix that first then
janv. 18 11:24:50 <akik>	OnkelTem: looks like somebody wrote how to do it with ubuntu https://securitynetworkinglinux.wordpress.com/2019/07/03/how-to-masquerade-nat-ipv4-traffic-using-ufw-on-ubuntu-cli/
janv. 18 11:28:54 <Ecko>	what ownership is needed for ls to show a directory?
janv. 18 11:29:28 <geirha>	read is enough
janv. 18 11:30:01 <geirha>	in order to access any of the files inside a directory, you need execute permission, but to just read the directory entries, read is enough
janv. 18 11:30:12 <Ecko>	ok thank you
janv. 18 11:31:15 <geirha>	and if a diretory has execute permission, but not read permission, you can still access files inside it if you know the filenames, but you won't be able to list them with ls
janv. 18 11:32:53 <Ecko>	tried out just now with read permissions, this is what `ls -l` shows
janv. 18 11:32:55 <Ecko>	https://paste.linux.chat/?cbdd490074b9cf08#3zrGqT8zdzu81XKYi2YHZ5jT3CEXrNfGYVgxp6WE5ueV
janv. 18 11:33:33 <Ecko>	with execute permissions it does show correct though
janv. 18 11:38:03 <xoranth>	I have a 13 GB file that I can process in ~1.4s with a custom program that uses O_DIRECT and io_uring, which implies a read bandwidth of ~10GB/s.
janv. 18 11:38:09 <xoranth>	But measuring bandwidth with `fio` with `ioengine=io_uring` and same block size and io depth gives me a read bandwith of 3.4GB/s.
janv. 18 11:38:15 <xoranth>	The filesystem is BTRFS, but I disabled compression for the file, and confirmed that compression is disabled with `compsize`. Any ideas of why I am seeing different bandwidths?
janv. 18 11:40:40 <selckin>	are you dropping cache for the custom program
janv. 18 11:41:30 <xoranth>	Yes, with `echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`
janv. 18 11:41:42 <xoranth>	But it shouldn't matter because of O_DIRECT?
janv. 18 11:44:45 <nkukard>	hi nasmConnoisseur
janv. 18 11:45:56 <nasmConnoisseur>	nkukard, I switched to Debian :)
janv. 18 12:07:34 <Fisher>	s it my imagination or is Linux now more popular than it was a few years ago?
janv. 18 12:07:53 <djph>	Fisher: yes.
janv. 18 12:13:58 <geirha>	Ecko: yeah, to fill in the long format it needs to stat(2) each file, and stat(2) requires execute permission on the directory
janv. 18 12:19:40 <Paddy_NI>	I wonder if there are any tools in the repos for retrieving old DNS records?
janv. 18 12:21:17 <selckin>	not really, would require someone keeping a db of them
janv. 18 12:22:39 <Paddy_NI>	selckin: I have found a few sites that do, unfortunately they don't work with the ".ie" TLD.
janv. 18 12:24:04 <DLange>	it's also a service typically charged for very serious $$$
janv. 18 12:24:49 <Guest1142>	test testdo i need reg
janv. 18 12:25:01 <DLange>	no no no need reg
janv. 18 12:26:59 <Guest1142>	Hello, I'm trying to run firmware-util.sh from mrchromebox.tech but it seems that i need to disable lockdown mode for it to beable to write to some raw io thing but trying to setting lsm=none in grub to disable lockdown mode will cause linux to panic as is aparently a feature, does anyone know how i can boot linux up without haveing lockdown mode enabled AND WITHOUT it causeing a kernel panic? yes
janv. 18 12:27:00 <Guest1142>	yes i know its security but thats irevelevent in my case. any and all input is very apreciated because this is super frusturateing right now
janv. 18 12:29:26 <Guest1142>	dmesg:"[   30.361863] Lockdown: flashrom: raw io port access is restricted; see man kernel_lockdown.7"
janv. 18 12:31:57 <Angels>	akik, thank you for the suggestion, but well it did not result in the version change. I am trying to find another solution, but got stuck on the following issue:
janv. 18 12:32:47 <Angels>	https://dpaste.org/RA1Qs
janv. 18 12:33:13 <Angels>	This hangs indefinitely for unobvious reason.
janv. 18 12:34:09 <Angels>	Is it possible to see more output from the client side to find out it? It looks like the 'bash -c' does not work as expected?
janv. 18 12:34:31 <Guest1142>	what do you mean DLange? are my messages not showing up?
janv. 18 12:34:37 <Angels>	This is a log from BitBucket when step 'ssh-run' is used: https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/ssh-run
janv. 18 12:36:10 <DLange>	Guest1142: I replied to your "<Guest1142> test testdo i need reg"
janv. 18 12:36:29 <Guest1142>	Oh, thank you.
janv. 18 12:37:20 <Angels>	And this is the whole BitBucket pipeline: https://dpaste.org/DKpRU
janv. 18 12:37:54 <Angels>	When a commit happens, it hangs like that with the last line: "debug2: channel 0: input drain -> closed".
janv. 18 12:39:57 <Angels>	err. this is the 'ssh -vvv' output: https://dpaste.org/VK2VB/raw
janv. 18 12:40:35 <selckin>	does it work if you do it manually?
janv. 18 12:41:31 <Angels>	What exactly? I don't have the access to that user since it's a staging server.
janv. 18 12:41:49 <DLange>	Guest1142: according to the fine manual page, the "Kernel Lockdown feature was added in Linux 5.4", so booting older live-CDs or so would probably help
janv. 18 12:44:38 <selckin>	Angels: well try it locally, ssh user@server bash -c 'bash --version' if you have access see if tha tworks first, also check the sshd logs on the server
janv. 18 12:49:15 <Guest1142>	DLange: Yeah, I'm looking at how to get a old kernel.  I'm running debian 12 right now.  i prob need to build it myself
janv. 18 12:49:28 <Guest1142>	*sigh* I think I'll go with plan B
janv. 18 13:03:07 <akik>	Angels: what version change? i thought you wanted to change the user shell?
janv. 18 13:04:48 <Angels>	akik, and this is the main reason of the user shell change. The Bash version.
janv. 18 13:05:31 <Angels>	The system version is v4, and the one I am trying to set the user is v5 - /usr/bin/bash52.

févr. 12 13:07:13 <mlu>	rapha: https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/
févr. 12 13:08:03 <mlu>	rapha: I imagine you don't want to use the german keymap because you code, right? :D
févr. 12 13:08:34 <HumbleGuy>	can someone give me some tips, generally, how should I proceed with a build error? how do I find fix for it?
févr. 12 13:09:09 <mlu>	HumbleGuy: it depends -- gotta see what the exact error is
févr. 12 13:09:16 <mlu>	HumbleGuy: do you code? if not, it's gonna be tough
févr. 12 13:09:22 <rapha>	mlu: never heard of it before :P
févr. 12 13:09:28 <mlu>	could be incompatible versions of gcc, could be missing dependencies, etc.
févr. 12 13:09:38 <tupni>	HumbleGuy: startup.S:34: Error: 64bit mode not supported on `i386'.
févr. 12 13:09:44 <mlu>	rapha: it's supported out of the box on most systems, but it's rarely exposed in the UI
févr. 12 13:09:56 <mlu>	r aphbut set your keymap to eu (or eurkey) and you'll be good to go
févr. 12 13:10:50 <mlu>	rapha: you'll also have the € and ß quite easily in addition to the ü
févr. 12 13:11:03 <HumbleGuy>	tupni what does that  mean?
févr. 12 13:11:07 <rapha>	hmm it seems to be the one called "English (US, euro on 5)"
févr. 12 13:11:16 <mlu>	whiel still having [ ] and { } in place -- just `setkbdmap eu` and you are good to go :)
févr. 12 13:11:32 <mlu>	rapha: I've seen it called many things, but eurkey is what it is
févr. 12 13:11:40 <rapha>	{}/\#|';/.,=-`~ all seem to be where they belong
févr. 12 13:11:50 *	rapha has a Keychron K8 TKL
févr. 12 13:11:50 <mlu>	rapha: does AltGr+S give you ß and AltGr+U give you ü?
févr. 12 13:12:06 <rapha>	no
févr. 12 13:12:20 <rapha>	ah, AltGr+5 has €
févr. 12 13:12:22 <rapha>	but that seems to be it
févr. 12 13:12:28 <mlu>	rapha: can you also produce a $ via Shift+4? while getting € via AltGr+5?
févr. 12 13:12:36 <rapha>	$, yes
févr. 12 13:12:45 <mlu>	ö :D
févr. 12 13:13:08 <mlu>	and then AltGr+4 for £ :D
févr. 12 13:13:17 <rapha>	4: no
févr. 12 13:13:24 <rapha>	so it's not eurokey
févr. 12 13:13:33 <HumbleGuy>	mlu I am a student in software engineer, so yeah I am learning now to code
févr. 12 13:14:00 <tupni>	HumbleGuy: you need target=amd64 instead of target=i386, I'd think.
févr. 12 13:14:01 <HumbleGuy>	but the linux kernel is too complicated to me
févr. 12 13:14:06 <mlu>	rapha: but good enough, I guess? :D
févr. 12 13:14:06 <rapha>	mlu: what is it called in your "Choose a layout" dialog?
févr. 12 13:14:13 <mlu>	rapha: it usually doesn't show up :(
févr. 12 13:14:19 <rapha>	oh. so how did you set it?
févr. 12 13:14:34 <mlu>	rapha: either in xorg.conf or temporarily: `setxkbmap eu`
févr. 12 13:14:42 <HumbleGuy>	tupni but when I did the grub-install it automatically installed for i386 architecture
févr. 12 13:15:02 <mlu>	but my favorite part: the degree sign is just AltGr+; like °
févr. 12 13:15:34 <rapha>	yes! that one works mlu ... now just need to make it permanent
févr. 12 13:15:41 <rapha>	can deffo get used to where the umlauts are, no probs
févr. 12 13:15:47 <mlu>	it's a useful keymap, but it's quite nonstandard -- almost as odd as using colemac
févr. 12 13:15:51 <rapha>	°°° yes, that's also nice
févr. 12 13:16:15 <rapha>	any downsides to it?
févr. 12 13:16:17 *	mlu is American so this keymap is very useful for the tricks
févr. 12 13:16:25 <mlu>	rapha: non-standard :)
févr. 12 13:16:29 <rapha>	so?
févr. 12 13:16:39 <mlu>	ohterwise, I'd say: there's no downsides and people should adopt this standard
févr. 12 13:16:51 <mlu>	it's just new and unusual
févr. 12 13:16:52 <rapha>	i mean, if i made my own layout and added umlauts to it, that'd be quite nonstandard, as well
févr. 12 13:17:07 <mlu>	the poeple that like it the best are either from North America or they're programmers
févr. 12 13:17:11 <mlu>	programmers are sadly a small minority
févr. 12 13:17:17 <mlu>	rapha: yep :)
févr. 12 13:17:24 <mlu>	rapha: how'd you think this keymap got invented?
févr. 12 13:17:34 <rapha>	lol fair enough, how did you guess i'm a programmer? :P
févr. 12 13:18:07 <Armand>	rapha: Coz yur weird. :P
févr. 12 13:18:16 <rapha>	i dare all North American programmers to try programming with a German layout for a bit, esp something curly-braces-heavy. just so you can feel our pain lol...
févr. 12 13:18:26 <rapha>	back at yer Armand :)
févr. 12 13:18:29 <Armand>	^_^
févr. 12 13:18:43 <mlu>	rapha: precisely ;)
févr. 12 13:19:28 <mlu>	and in America, we don't have umlauts -- maybe at most an accent mark because of the Spanish
févr. 12 13:20:09 <rapha>	mlu: okay, so i just found something interesting. not sure if this is just Cinnamon, but the "Keyboard" dialog's "Layouts" tab has a checkbox called "Include less-common layouts in the selection list" :D
févr. 12 13:20:53 <rapha>	mlu: what i still haven't found is the French accent aigu and accent grave.
févr. 12 13:21:06 <rapha>	hmm, and e^ doesn't work.
févr. 12 13:21:36 <rapha>	so i guess Germans are good Europeans and French are not good Europeans to the Eurokey author?
févr. 12 13:21:52 <mlu>	¬.¬ :D
févr. 12 13:22:09 <rapha>	it does have ï which is also needed for French
févr. 12 13:22:22 <rapha>	and œ for the Nordic languages
févr. 12 13:22:32 <rapha>	Tør also works, nice
févr. 12 13:22:44 <mlu>	https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/pics/layout.png -- print this out
févr. 12 13:22:54 <rapha>	Þør, rather
févr. 12 13:23:00 <tupni>	æ, not whatever you typed, rapha ;)
févr. 12 13:23:02 <rapha>	already did

févr. 12 13:24:29 <mlu>	hurdy gur gur... :P
févr. 12 13:24:31 <rapha>	ah, i think Swedish doesn't have œ, only æ, right?
févr. 12 13:24:36 *	mlu wants some lingonberries now
févr. 12 13:24:52 <luna>	rapha: yeah å ä ö
févr. 12 13:24:52 <tupni>	rapha: that's irrelevant, but thems be norwegian letters, anyways
févr. 12 13:25:01 <luna>	tupni: yeah norweigan and danish
févr. 12 13:25:06 <tupni>	true
févr. 12 13:25:24 <rapha>	tupni: luna: œ is used in French, for example œf (egg)
févr. 12 13:25:34 <luna>	rapha: oh alright
févr. 12 13:25:55 *	zx2001b remembers the danish chef in the muppet show
févr. 12 13:25:58 *	rapha wonders if Nordic æ is the same sound as German ä
févr. 12 13:27:06 <zx2001b>	rapha: it is similar
févr. 12 13:27:10 <mlu>	Ö -- here, have a bear :) :Þ
févr. 12 13:27:32 *	zx2001b rather has a dropbear (as in ssh server :))
févr. 12 13:27:34 <rapha>	:]
févr. 12 13:29:36 *	mlu watches out for dropbears
févr. 12 13:29:55 <rapha>	mlu: ooooh ... that layout just doesn't give you the combination characters. but you do get èéë. that just leaves a combining ^. why in the world is it not combining?
févr. 12 13:30:15 <mlu>	rapha: try AltGr+Shift+7
févr. 12 13:30:42 <rapha>	ē hmm
févr. 12 13:30:48 <rapha>	that looks like a macron
févr. 12 13:30:55 <rapha>	ě
févr. 12 13:31:05 <rapha>	that's a haček
févr. 12 13:31:17 <rapha>	ê THAT is a circonflex
févr. 12 13:31:44 <rapha>	cool, so we got German, the Nordic languages, Spanish, i think even Polish and Czek covered
févr. 12 13:31:47 <mlu>	rapha: ** AltGr+Shift+6
févr. 12 13:31:53 <mlu>	rapha: there's even a greek mode
févr. 12 13:31:56 <mlu>	rapha: https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/layout.html
févr. 12 13:33:47 <rapha>	i would have been interested in Turkish but the i-without-dot they use is missing (ı <--- this one)
févr. 12 13:33:56 <bertvvvs>	why not just use "English International (AltGr keys)"?
févr. 12 13:36:02 <rapha>	Hmm ... got "English (US, intl., AltGr Unicode combining)" ... and "English (Western European AlrGr dead keys)"
févr. 12 13:36:31 <bertvvvs>	the first one
févr. 12 13:43:21 <terabit>	is it possible to delete a specific entry from an ext4 journal? google is telling me you can enable/disable the journal but I can't find a way to tamper/remove specific entries
févr. 12 13:43:28 <terabit>	problem: https://paste.rs/tcoT0.txt :)
févr. 12 13:46:58 <rapha>	bertvvvs: hmm. that's a tradeoff. the one you suggest does seem more standard. but the umlauts are less mnemonic.
févr. 12 13:47:46 <bertvvvs>	do you need ALL the accents?
févr. 12 13:47:58 <rapha>	no, it's not about that
févr. 12 13:48:03 <Armand>	We can ditch the northern accents.
févr. 12 13:48:08 <Armand>	No-one wants those.
févr. 12 13:48:15 <rapha>	oh! the Western European layout is really interesting
févr. 12 13:48:32 <akik>	azerty is a mind____
févr. 12 13:48:55 <Armand>	azerty can go DIAF
févr. 12 13:49:41 <rapha>	ah, no, the b-shaped s is not reachable on that one. not sure how that was intended by the layout author. sad. would have been a good one.

févr. 12 14:01:15 <noob93>	Hi, looking to take the plunge into a linux-based OS - any recommendations on hardware? Either Lenovo or Dell XPS series come up, although can't find any locally that come with Linux. The Dell Inspirion does however.
févr. 12 14:01:26 <noob93>	Anyone have anything against these models?
févr. 12 14:01:28 <ananke>	noob93: literally, anything
févr. 12 14:01:43 <ananke>	noob93: those are not models, those are model lines
févr. 12 14:02:03 <koollman>	lenovo is a whole vendor name :)
févr. 12 14:02:06 <ananke>	so you're not going to find anything specific, considering they are not specific
févr. 12 14:02:26 <rlikon>	noob93: support linux laptop brands
févr. 12 14:02:39 <noob93>	@ananke, right - not specific models - thanks - just in general I heard those model lines were recommended. Perhaps more specific models within those lines would be recommended?
févr. 12 14:03:18 <noob93>	@koolman, sorry yeah - the thinkpad series in particular, but the whole brand I heard works well
févr. 12 14:03:21 <ananke>	noob93: find a model with features that fits your needs/requirements. then search 'that model + linux' to see if there are any issues.
févr. 12 14:03:43 <noob93>	@ananke, what do you mean "literally anything"?
févr. 12 14:04:06 <rapha>	bertvvvs: on the one you mentioned, yes. on the one where it's supposed to be on AltGr+8 (the Western European one), it doesn't work.
févr. 12 14:04:10 <noob93>	I've heard that certain brands - let's say Mac silicon for example, won't allow Linux to run smoothly and some drivers will be buggy etc
févr. 12 14:04:14 <noob93>	That is why I ask
févr. 12 14:04:39 <ananke>	noob93: literally anything. the number of systems that work with linux is larger than the number of systems that do not, when it comes to the brands you've listed
févr. 12 14:04:54 <rlikon>	noob93: system76, Tuxedo, Framework, Slimbook
févr. 12 14:05:03 <ananke>	noob93: you didn't list apple as a potential choice, so that was never taken into consideration
févr. 12 14:05:41 <noob93>	@ananke, gotcha. Those were the brands I heard worked best. Definitely open to more suggestions tho :)
févr. 12 14:05:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	noob93, but mac silicon macs are not intel based they are armbased
févr. 12 14:05:57 <noob93>	@rlikon, will look into those
févr. 12 14:06:00 <rlikon>	noob93: I forgot PineBook
févr. 12 14:06:19 <hacknorris>	someone knows how to autoupdate main menu when anything is installed? i use openbox on debian btw
févr. 12 14:06:42 <Nanobest>	I havent been seeing much about PineBook lately
févr. 12 14:06:43 <noob93>	@SG, this I know. Prob there are work arounds, or will be in future.
févr. 12 14:06:54 <ananke>	noob93: if you look for recommendations based on a small sample size (IRC channel, time of day, few people), then you're likely going to end up with hardware that doesn't fit your needs
févr. 12 14:06:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	i have never had an issue with an dell and i have been putting linux on them for 25 years
févr. 12 14:07:09 <ananke>	especially if you go down the rabit hole of pinebook. seriously?
févr. 12 14:07:18 <rlikon>	lolwtf --> https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform
févr. 12 14:07:37 <akik>	Southern_Gentlem: rocking an old dell here 24/7
févr. 12 14:07:40 <ananke>	noob93: avoid niche platforms.
févr. 12 14:07:42 <Nanobest>	I have never once heard of these people
févr. 12 14:07:59 <noob93>	@ananke, not sure - I'm just new to Linux -a complete noob and want to give it a try, so appreciate any direction
févr. 12 14:08:16 <ananke>	noob93: do you have any existing hardware?
févr. 12 14:08:16 <Nanobest>	noob93 Welcome aboard
févr. 12 14:08:21 <noob93>	@southern_gentlem, thanks - that is good to know
févr. 12 14:08:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	Nanobest, what people me? i have been in the fedora projefct since fc1
févr. 12 14:08:33 <Nanobest>	Nah I meant mntre
févr. 12 14:08:44 <Nanobest>	MNT reform laptop
févr. 12 14:08:47 <noob93>	@nanobest, thank you
févr. 12 14:09:12 <ananke>	noob93: and point being: don't buy stuff specific to a platform that you're not familiar with. if you end up not liking it, you've wasted money
févr. 12 14:09:23 <noob93>	@ananke, I want to build or get a separate machine for my new adventure / foray
févr. 12 14:09:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	noob93, if you have a modern machine  put whatever linux you want to try in a vm
févr. 12 14:09:33 <noob93>	Brands i mentioned also have a lot of 2nd hand
févr. 12 14:09:35 <Nanobest>	Maybe dip your toes into the experience with VMs
févr. 12 14:09:50 <Nanobest>	Virtual machines are pretty good to start familiarizing yourself with it
févr. 12 14:10:08 <ananke>	noob93: so start with what you have.
févr. 12 14:10:17 <noob93>	@Nano & Gentlemn - I did consider VMs, just don't want to suck the life out of my main machine - I'm aware they use a lot of memory :)
févr. 12 14:10:34 <Nanobest>	well, that memory's there to be used aint it
févr. 12 14:10:36 <ananke>	virtual machines, live usb sticks, that should be your initial stuff
févr. 12 14:11:16 <ananke>	vms don't inherently use 'a lot of memory'
févr. 12 14:11:22 <noob93>	lol
févr. 12 14:11:44 <Nanobest>	If you have a spare old machine laying around you could test distros on there
févr. 12 14:11:48 <Nanobest>	Thats what I did
févr. 12 14:12:16 <hacknorris>	am asking once again: someone knows how to autoupdate main menu when anything is installed? i use openbox on debian btw
févr. 12 14:12:20 <akik>	he wants a laptop and you suggest a vm. smh...
févr. 12 14:12:24 <noob93>	Gotcha, thanks guys - def keen on saving where I can.
févr. 12 14:12:50 <noob93>	I tried to bring my old intel Macbook back to life, but it felt it was better off in the shadowrealm
févr. 12 14:13:08 <noob93>	(for testing / trial new OS that is)
févr. 12 14:13:31 <noob93>	@akik..lol
févr. 12 14:13:33 <rlikon>	noob93: I almost forgot this interesting offering --> https://www.gpd.hk/default
févr. 12 14:13:52 <lopid>	hacknorris, http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Menus/Debian-menu
févr. 12 14:14:23 <Nanobest>	darn it i was looking up the link
févr. 12 14:15:39 <noob93>	Anyway, thanks all SG, Nano & ananke
févr. 12 14:16:09 <ananke>	noob93: you can always try to install linux on that macbook. just be sure to look up that specific model to see what the known gotchas are
févr. 12 14:16:49 <noob93>	@ananke, yeah, I did all the research and was good to go & even bought a new battery for it, but it woke up and then died again. It's done its time.
févr. 12 14:17:04 <noob93>	Could not resuscitate
févr. 12 14:17:27 <rlikon>	noob93: also, any 100$ used compact pc will do. Plenty out there.
févr. 12 14:17:40 <noob93>	Is there a preferred website or forum to look up said "gotchas" and warnings etc
févr. 12 14:17:53 <noob93>	@rlikon, thanks sir
févr. 12 14:19:38 <ananke>	noob93: google. a lot will depend on what distribution you decide to try, so you'll have to google for '<model> + <distribution name>'
févr. 12 14:20:29 <ananke>	noob93: you may want to start off with something that's widely supported and popular, like ubuntu or fedora
févr. 12 14:20:30 <rlikon>	2GB is enough for full DE testing.
févr. 12 14:22:13 <noob93>	@ananke, thanks - trusty old Google then!
févr. 12 14:22:29 <noob93>	Yup - was def thinking Ubuntu for starters, ty
févr. 12 14:23:11 <rlikon>	noob93: to be honest, i'll start with some more familar-looking DE like KDE/plasma
févr. 12 14:23:51 <noob93>	I am curious @rlikon, @ananke, @Southern_gentlemn, what machines you use?
févr. 12 14:23:55 <rlikon>	noob93: ubuntu/gnome hides all GUI structure under a 'search bar' LOLOLOLO
févr. 12 14:24:02 <noob93>	What set ups do the OGs run?
févr. 12 14:24:22 <noob93>	And do you also have a separate machine for work, or main, or you use Linux for everything?
févr. 12 14:24:44 <ananke>	noob93: I've been using linux for 30 years, and I manage thousands of systems. no, I don't use linux on desktop/laptop.
févr. 12 14:25:09 <rlikon>	noob93: you'll find out as you try out. Impossible to get all the answers in advance, *without* trying.
févr. 12 14:25:10 <noob93>	@ananke - thousands of systems???
févr. 12 14:25:32 <noob93>	@ananke - so you just use Linux for servers? May I ask what you use on Desktop / laptop?
févr. 12 14:25:40 <akik>	noob93: i use linux wherever i can
févr. 12 14:25:43 <ananke>	noob93: macos
févr. 12 14:25:51 <rlikon>	ananke: what do you use? electrons?
févr. 12 14:26:22 <noob93>	@rlikon, true - that's why I want to dive in :)
févr. 12 14:26:23 <akik>	noob93: when high sierra's support ended on the imac, it was replaced with ubuntu mate
févr. 12 14:26:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	noob93, i am tech support at a Uni so i use latitudes and precision laptops
févr. 12 14:27:17 <noob93>	@southerngentlmn, I think those are Dell's from memory...
févr. 12 14:27:27 <noob93>	Do you prefer mac0s or Windows at home>
févr. 12 14:27:29 <noob93>	?
févr. 12 14:27:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	noob93, yes mainly dells
févr. 12 14:27:35 <rlikon>	Southern_Gentlem: curious question, what's the linux adoption in academia?
févr. 12 14:27:47 <luna>	got a Latitude from the bf Latitude 7390
févr. 12 14:27:51 <luna>	for xmas
févr. 12 14:28:13 <rlikon>	I am a bit surprise the little adoption of linux among lay tech ppl.
févr. 12 14:28:20 <ananke>	rlikon: 'academia' is a large field, adoption varies depending on what actual purpose we're talking about
févr. 12 14:28:27 <rlikon>	I don't anybody around me using linux.
févr. 12 14:28:27 <Southern_Gentlem>	rlikon, mainly servers  and i also have laptop users
févr. 12 14:28:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	rlikon, my uni has had a linux users group for  25 years
févr. 12 14:29:07 <rlikon>	a lot of ppl go into panic when they don't see the familiar m$$ office/photoshop.
févr. 12 14:29:17 <ananke>	rlikon: eg: services, science/research - all heavy linux users, but most of those involve servers. linux on desktop is not popular anywhere
févr. 12 14:29:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	and then you show them libreoffice and the interface look like theolder version of office and they are alot happier
févr. 12 14:29:56 <rlikon>	Southern_Gentlem: among students, professors, library computers, labs, etc.
févr. 12 14:30:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	strong user group of all the above and the local comunity
févr. 12 14:30:37 <rlikon>	normal students computer labs (not scientific lab).
févr. 12 14:30:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	my computer lab had a linux box
févr. 12 14:31:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	with a windows VM for those that wanted to go that direction
févr. 12 14:31:52 <rlikon>	Southern_Gentlem: the sad part is that they load a .docx in libreoffice and right away claim it's not good because it renders bad.
févr. 12 14:31:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	most of my people are running matlab so that runs in everything (linux,winblows, mac)
févr. 12 14:32:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	rlikon, load the M$ fonts and there is no issue
févr. 12 14:32:49 <rlikon>	Southern_Gentlem: wait, you have to support the three platforms???
févr. 12 14:32:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes
févr. 12 14:33:23 <rlikon>	Southern_Gentlem: don't ppl drive you mad with their issues?
févr. 12 14:34:16 <Nanobest>	The IT support at my university looks dead inside
févr. 12 14:42:25 <TristonC13>	good morning all!
févr. 12 14:45:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	rlikon, not that many issues to be truthful
févr. 12 14:54:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	rlikon, i havee roughly 300 machines and 11 printers, the printers give more issues than the people to be honset
févr. 12 14:58:48 <ananke>	honestly, 'the academia' concept is as vague as 'the industry' counterpart. there are so many subdomains in each, there's no easy rule of thumb. other than, of course: linux is popular on server side, and is rare on desktop
févr. 12 15:00:56 <noob93>	@ananke, why is linux rare on desktop? Does it lack certain features that make it undesirable?
févr. 12 15:01:28 <akik>	it's rare on the desktop if you don't invest in it, or your users don't have the need for it
févr. 12 15:01:56 <noob93>	For example, why do you use macos on your own machine instead of Linux? I figured everyone in here would be #linuxtillidie type
févr. 12 15:02:15 <ananke>	noob93: it doesn't run windows software, there's no AD equivalent for managing users/groups/systems
févr. 12 15:02:17 <noob93>	@akik, do you only use linux
févr. 12 15:02:19 <noob93>	?
févr. 12 15:02:24 <Armand>	You don't "use" MacOS.... MacOS uses you!
févr. 12 15:02:31 <agent314>	yo ppl
févr. 12 15:02:32 <dTal>	Linux nerdery ain't what it used to be!
févr. 12 15:02:40 <hodapp>	eh, I have enough Linux boxes that I don't need to turn my Macbook into one
févr. 12 15:02:41 <Armand>	That's a-paddlin'
févr. 12 15:02:43 <agent314>	macosx is unix-like
févr. 12 15:03:09 <agent314>	oit's not linux, and i am not sure if it's posix but it's definitely unix-like
févr. 12 15:03:15 <ananke>	noob93: macos provides me with access to the various software I need, good user interface, and still all the tools I'd want from Linux.
févr. 12 15:04:15 <akik>	agent314: os x/macos is actually posix certified unix
févr. 12 15:04:23 <akik>	since 10.5
févr. 12 15:04:40 <hodapp>	it's also for me a more tolerable way to run real MS Office for those times when I have to
févr. 12 15:04:43 <noob93>	@ananke, gotcha - thanks.
févr. 12 15:04:45 <dTal>	Yeah but is that important in any way
févr. 12 15:05:02 <hodapp>	as Windows lately has just gone off the deep end with the obnoxious crap
févr. 12 15:05:06 <ananke>	hodapp: bingo. I can run office.
févr. 12 15:05:24 <hodapp>	and I got Office for dirt-cheap on some deal from... wherever, I forget
févr. 12 15:05:36 <dTal>	I don't really understand the utility of microsoft office
févr. 12 15:05:38 <akik>	it is important to say how things are
févr. 12 15:05:56 <hodapp>	dTal: it's great for reading files that were made in MS Office and just don't quite render right in LibreOffice or whatever
févr. 12 15:06:15 <dTal>	right, so it's only relevant because it's relevant, not because of any intrinsic worth
févr. 12 15:06:15 <hodapp>	like someone's derpy Powerpoint slides where I just want the text to be readable
févr. 12 15:06:17 <ananke>	noob93: one doesn't have to run linux on everything to be heavily involved with linux. it's not some kind of a cult, despite what some fringe actors would make you believe
févr. 12 15:06:45 <dTal>	I miss when Linux was a cult
févr. 12 15:06:58 <Armand>	dTal: You already miss tomorrow?
févr. 12 15:07:00 <Armand>	O_o
févr. 12 15:07:21 <hodapp>	dTal: WYSIWYG office stuff still is useful sometimes; it has that going for it. there are plenty of other ways to get that though
févr. 12 15:07:37 <noob93>	@ananke hehe..yeah, fair enough
févr. 12 15:07:58 <dTal>	I mean there used to be a real sense that people were aware that we're fighting an ideological battle, that free software and gpl was important and that proprietary software was a genuine enemy to important hacker values
févr. 12 15:07:59 <akik>	dTal: of course it is important not to spread false facts
févr. 12 15:08:05 <hodapp>	dTal: which is to say: it has that intrinsic worth, but so does LibreOffice
févr. 12 15:08:11 <noob93>	Just thought there might be a fair few diehards, that preferred it for everything for the opensource philosophy it enables
févr. 12 15:08:39 <hodapp>	plus LibreOffice comes with a LOGO interpreter and someday I'll require that for something I'm sure
févr. 12 15:08:45 <dTal>	people used to use linux even though it was less practical than proprietary alternatives, on principle
févr. 12 15:09:21 <dTal>	noob93: diehard here
févr. 12 15:09:21 <hodapp>	if this is the life you want, there are plenty of impractical OSes still out there
févr. 12 15:09:24 <tanath>	for most of its life linux wasn't good enough on desktop for most people. only in recent years has it been good enough for a significant number of people, but it still has the previous perception
févr. 12 15:09:27 <noob93>	@dTal, yeah - there's def something admirable about that.
févr. 12 15:09:32 <hodapp>	hell, you can run RISC OS on a Raspberry Pi
févr. 12 15:09:43 <hodapp>	you could run Plan 9, or Haiku
févr. 12 15:09:46 <ananke>	noob93: it's a tool, like any other. there's no need to be religious about it
févr. 12 15:09:51 <noob93>	The cult-like thing doesn't have to be a pejorative either
févr. 12 15:09:55 <akik>	hihihihii this is unbelievably stupid. i set the firefox scrollbar to always show, but the web page hides it
févr. 12 15:10:01 <hodapp>	I know of no other way to see cult-like
févr. 12 15:10:04 <dTal>	hodapp: impractical is obviously not a goal, but something to be tolerated for ideological reasons
févr. 12 15:10:07 <ananke>	noob93: except it is. cult is a problem.
févr. 12 15:10:20 <dTal>	cult is why you have linux at all
févr. 12 15:10:23 <tanath>	i switched to linux because windows crashed and corrupted my hdd and i lost tons of data. and the only installer i had was for linux i had planned to check out
févr. 12 15:10:51 <dTal>	All of free software is built by people who actually cared enough about the ideology to donate their precious time for free
févr. 12 15:10:54 <hodapp>	I switched to it because I was switching from Windows Me.
févr. 12 15:10:56 <noob93>	@ananke legion, but in a cozy type of way
févr. 12 15:10:59 <hodapp>	for people from that era it requires almost no other explanation
févr. 12 15:11:11 <tanath>	i switched from win98
févr. 12 15:11:17 <ananke>	noob93: even your own language: 'diehard'. you're describing people who are typically not open for objective assessments, they're so 'dead' set in their way
févr. 12 15:11:18 <hodapp>	dTal: a whole lot of free software is made by people paid for their time
févr. 12 15:11:24 <dTal>	hodapp: sure, *now* it is
févr. 12 15:11:25 <tanath>	though it was a few years old at the time
févr. 12 15:12:00 <dTal>	because of an ecosystem bootstrapped by ideologues, and if you forget that for a second the corporations will take it over and make it proprietary again
févr. 12 15:12:17 <Foxboron>	dTal: Are you saying RMS wasn't cashing inn his MIT paycheck while working at MIT :)?
févr. 12 15:12:22 <tanath>	i think a lot of people could switch to linux without much issue these days
févr. 12 15:12:49 <dTal>	Foxboron: I'm saying MIT wasn't paying him for GNU, that's for sure :)
févr. 12 15:13:46 <noob93>	Good way of putting it: <dTal> hodapp: impractical is obviously not a goal, but something to be tolerated for ideological reasons
févr. 12 15:14:52 <noob93>	@ananke, obviously in its strictest sense "cult" could be negative, but think of the term in varying connotations - such as "cult movie" etc it's a spectrum
févr. 12 15:14:53 <ananke>	noob93: for somebody who's just starting with linux, you seem to have quite a lot of preconceptions about its community
févr. 12 15:15:31 <noob93>	@ananke, part of what attracts me to linux is the philosophy of perhaps the past generation of diehards
févr. 12 15:15:44 <noob93>	But I'm just asking questions as I'm curious on ya'all's takes
févr. 12 15:16:42 <Foxboron>	dTal: At some point I'm not sure how much work RMS actually put into GNU compared to the people that where sold on his vision
févr. 12 15:23:28 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
févr. 12 15:24:00 <zx2001d>	hi
févr. 12 15:24:06 <akik>	lol
févr. 12 15:24:55 <akik>	what do you think when somebody says gnu? rms
févr. 12 15:25:44 <akik>	gnu wouldn't exist without him
févr. 12 15:27:04 <dTal>	It's kind of impressive and thought provoking that somebody with such nonexistent social skills as RMS was able to bootstrap what is essentially a social enterprise
févr. 12 15:27:17 <dTal>	it speaks to the power of his vision
févr. 12 15:27:18 <Foxboron>	"social enterprise", lol
févr. 12 15:27:19 <akik>	hehe
févr. 12 15:27:48 <akik>	dTal: you realize that happened 40 years ago, right?
févr. 12 15:27:58 <dTal>	Foxboron: Well yes! Like you said, the value was really in persuading others to jump on board.
févr. 12 15:28:06 <dTal>	akik: yes? what of it?
févr. 12 15:28:09 <Foxboron>	dTal: I wouldn't call it a *social* enterprise
févr. 12 15:28:33 <akik>	dTal: people change in 40 years quite much
févr. 12 15:29:01 <zx2001d>	xfburn apparently uses gstreamer for decoding mp3 when burning an audio cd from mp3 files. the result seems to be byte-swapped audio, it's all messed up when playing it on the cd player.
févr. 12 15:29:05 <dTal>	akik: If you're suggesting that RMS was some sort of social savant in the 80s, I'm inclined to disbelieve you :p
févr. 12 15:29:19 <akik>	dTal: i'm inclined to smile at you
févr. 12 15:30:44 <dTal>	akik: you gonna elaborate or
févr. 12 15:31:18 <akik>	dTal: you just said he hasn't changed in 40 years
févr. 12 15:31:37 <dTal>	I did?
févr. 12 15:31:44 <dTal>	where?

févr. 12 15:35:08 <n4dir>	i fail to see how linux would exist without gnu being around back then
févr. 12 15:35:24 <akik>	somebody is seeing the light
févr. 12 15:35:40 <dTal>	it might even be observed that it is precisely RMS's reluctance to conform that was essential to his motivation to start GNU
févr. 12 15:36:13 <dTal>	a normal person would have tolerated the proprietary printer drivers, or at best hacked around them, not started a whole OS project

Feb 20 15:22:45 <hexnewbie>	It's not immediately clear what the reason of the kernel panic was (“I followed this guide” provides almost-zero clue), so I'd assume /boot running out of space was the culprit. The most common problem on upgrades, can prevent future adjustments like installation of zfs/nvidia/whatever that regenerates initramfs, and the older kernels can also go amiss depending on how you “fixed” it

Feb 20 15:56:31 <Masklin>	I use Konsole, Scissors. It's default for KDE, I think.
Feb 20 15:58:02 <WantToHelp>	Khaytsus: After booting into the previous kernel the drivers are working now. So thank you. However I would perfer not leaving 6.1.8-18-amd64 in a half configured state

Feb 20 16:02:46 <Scissors>	Masklin: I bet you can say "well, I have kde, and Globulation2 works for me" :) So, all I need is just to install KDE, right? :)
Feb 20 16:03:24 <Masklin>	Idk about that, Scissors.
Feb 20 16:03:33 <Scissors>	Game crashed even if fresh run, (I mean, even if game folder completely erased)
Feb 20 16:03:40 <Masklin>	But I just un-broke my screen session, somehow. I button-mashed and somehow it came back alive.
Feb 20 16:04:40 <WantToHelp>	Namarrgon: Those are the linux image package and the headers package. I have not tried to reinstall them. I am not confident that installing kernel packages is just like installing any other package.
Feb 20 16:04:45 <Scissors>	Masklin: it's bash problem? or process?
Feb 20 16:04:58 <Namarrgon>	WantToHelp: it's like any other package

Feb 20 16:05:24 <Namarrgon>	otherwise find the log of the package manager and see what went wrong during the configuration step
Feb 20 16:06:34 <Masklin>	Scissors, I don't know what to call it. It just froze while I was switching between "windows" using Ctrl+a 0-9.
Feb 20 16:07:35 <Masklin>	Perhaps you're not supposed to switch to windows that don't exist yet.

Feb 20 16:35:42 <xx>	enable contrib and non-free for bookworm-updates repo, run apt update, run apt upgrade, dpkg-reconfigure the nvidia dkms package, enjoy. Make sure you have kernel headers installed too
Feb 20 16:39:14 <Namarrgon>	WantToHelp: where are the nvidia packages from?
Feb 20 16:40:11 <WantToHelp>	xx: I've been using nvidia drivers on debian 12 nicely since last year. I had a kernel panic and fixed it by booting into my previous kernel version and updating initramfs. After that drivers stopped working on kernel 6.1.0-18-amd64. Rebooted upon Khaytsus' advice into my previouskernel - 6.1.0-15-amd64 and now everything displays nicely again. But the issue of the broken kernel/driver combination for
Feb 20 16:40:17 <WantToHelp>	-18-amd64 is still there
Feb 20 16:40:42 <xx>	trivial fix then
Feb 20 16:40:48 <Khaytsus>	WantToHelp: Yes, I suggest you ask in Debian's channels if you have not, really should start there for something this distro-specific, and based on their feedback maybe log a bug.
Feb 20 16:40:52 <xx>	install linux-headers-amd64
Feb 20 16:41:12 <xx>	and yes, #debian has dealt with lots of people having this problem already
Feb 20 16:41:48 <Khaytsus>	See, this is why you should ask such distro-specific questions in their channel to start with
Feb 20 16:42:07 <Khaytsus>	xx: Is that a new package that's required?
Feb 20 16:42:50 <xx>	Khaytsus: it's not "new", it's a metapackage that depends on the latest kernel headers, as opposed to installing only headers for a specific kernel, which becomes out of date the moment a newer kernel is installed
Feb 20 16:43:15 <Khaytsus>	xx: Why the new issue?
Feb 20 16:43:50 <xx>	lots of people do the mistake "Oh they want me to install header for kernel 6.1.123? Ok I'll install linux-headers-6.1.123-amd64." and then it breaks when the kernel upgrades to 6.1.124
Feb 20 16:44:12 <WantToHelp>	I will go to debian then
Feb 20 16:44:14 <xx>	but this whole issue is because nvidia did something dumb
Feb 20 16:44:32 <WantToHelp>	xx: I have that package marked as 'iU'
Feb 20 16:44:43 <xx>	come to #debian
Feb 20 16:44:45 <Khaytsus>	WantToHelp: Just to be clear, you're certainly not off topic asking here, but something that distro specific a distro channel is way more likely to know what's going on faster.
Feb 20 16:45:08 <WantToHelp>	Thanks for the help. I will go to #debian
Feb 20 16:48:23 <boc_th>	WantToHelp: in the future, it might also be a good idea to not use nvidia with a distro whose devs go out of their way to make life difficult for anyone who wants to use proprietary software or blobs.
Feb 20 16:48:27 <boc_th>	or use AMD
Feb 20 16:49:01 <Namarrgon>	/join #linux-ideology-chat
Feb 20 16:49:52 <boc_th>	that was a relevant advice
Feb 20 16:50:03 <boc_th>	if you're a FOSS evangelist, debian is great
Feb 20 16:50:22 <Khaytsus>	Pretty sure lots of people use nvidia just fine on Debian.
Feb 20 16:50:23 <boc_th>	if you want to use official nvidia drivers, it's not so great
Feb 20 16:51:40 <boc_th>	I'm sure it does, but "works on my machine" is of little use when things break
Feb 20 16:52:45 <boc_th>	I personally went the "use AMD" route, because proprietary drivers always cause issues at some point

Feb 20 16:56:15 <eqw>	i type `nft list ruleset` after reboot. It prints nothing. Then i type `nft -f /etc/nftables.conf`. Then i see my nft rules have loaded. How to do that automatically? Debian 11
Feb 20 16:56:37 <Namarrgon>	is the service that loads the rules enabled?
Feb 20 16:59:01 <eqw>	what service does this in debian 11?
Feb 20 17:00:33 <boc_th>	Obviously, amdgpu is the official driver after all. I don't think you need fglrx unless you have HD3xxx or sometihng.
Feb 20 17:01:01 <Namarrgon>	eqw: i don't know, try "nftables.service" or have a look at /usr/lib/systemd/system
Feb 20 17:01:12 <xiaomiao>	fglrx was never a good solution
Feb 20 17:01:25 <xiaomiao>	I think my personal best with it was an uptime of 11 minutes

Feb 20 17:05:17 <zanoh>	dink, that strongly depends if it's an ARM or x86 chromebook
Feb 20 17:05:33 <dink>	it;s arm, unfortunately
Feb 20 17:06:02 <zanoh>	Eh... I don't think you're in a hopeless situation. What distro were you aiming for to begin with?
Feb 20 17:06:18 <dink>	oh, figured :)
Feb 20 17:06:19 <dink>	hehe
Feb 20 17:06:34 <dink>	anything not chrome would be fine, though, I've been a slackware guy since 95
Feb 20 17:07:11 <ioria>	eqw, have you tried with netfilter-persistent ?
Feb 20 17:07:29 <zanoh>	You would have to enable developer mode, then run a few commands to allow pressing Ctrl + L to boot into alternative OS, that's if your chromebook is compatible with the scripts to flash the BIOS.
Feb 20 17:07:34 <boc_th>	gentoo should work in some capacity, but I don't think it would be very practical
Feb 20 17:08:08 <dink>	I just need something with firefox, and gives me control of the system
Feb 20 17:08:15 <zanoh>	I'm typing this on an x86 chromebook myself, debian and fedora has worked like a charm (for the most part with a few driver issues).
Feb 20 17:08:15 <eqw>	Namarrgon: thank you!
Feb 20 17:08:45 <zanoh>	I don't know if ubuntu has an ARM port, but always worth checking out.
Feb 20 17:08:56 <dink>	alright, thanks for the tip
Feb 20 17:09:17 <eqw>	ioria: sounds like unnecessary installing extra package
Feb 20 17:09:25 <zanoh>	The gallium wiki, has a great how-to guide to switch to developer mode and then enable alternative OS boot.
Feb 20 17:10:44 <zanoh>	Just don't be surprised if the speakers don't work, because I have to use my bluetooth headphones to get audio to work.
Feb 20 17:11:49 <zanoh>	I'm pretty optimistic about KDE6 coming at the very end of the month.
Feb 20 17:13:30 <scottpedia>	zanoh: do you use terminal on your x86 chromebook?
Feb 20 17:13:55 <zanoh>	I'm using irssi right now. Konsole works perfectly fine.
Feb 20 17:14:09 <scottpedia>	and it's running android? is it rooted?
Feb 20 17:14:19 <zanoh>	What? No. This is native linux
Feb 20 17:14:48 <scottpedia>	ohh okay so you installed linux on your x86 chromebook? zanoh
Feb 20 17:15:57 <zanoh>	Yup. Running native Fedora 39, no different than running it on say a thinkpad (save for some gotchas here and there, but it's tolerable).
Feb 20 17:16:20 <scottpedia>	ok that sounds great
Feb 20 17:16:41 <scottpedia>	i've always wanted to get a cheap x86 chromebook
Feb 20 17:17:18 <zanoh>	There is a reason why schools roll them out over windows laptops, dirt cheap to buy.
Feb 20 17:17:21 <hodapp>	I had a cheap ARM one back ~10 years ago just as a beater
Feb 20 17:17:49 <hodapp>	it was fine for SSH and browsing, and surprisingly functional with 'real' Linux installed with crouton or whatever was the way back then
Feb 20 17:18:03 <scottpedia>	would you send me the link to your model please? i haven't spotted any promising choices on amazon zanoh
Feb 20 17:18:21 <zanoh>	It's a samsung chromebook. Plus (v2).
Feb 20 17:18:32 <scottpedia>	ok gotcha
Feb 20 17:18:40 <zanoh>	The (Mr.Chromebox?) website should have a full list of compatible models.
Feb 20 17:20:25 <zanoh>	Now, YMMV, because the speakers and headphone jack don't really work, I have to use bluetooth to get audio.
Feb 20 17:20:33 <zanoh>	Everything else is fine
Feb 20 17:20:53 <scottpedia>	for some reason i can't tolerate arm on anything except smartphones and embedded devices
Feb 20 17:21:13 <scottpedia>	the workhorse will have to be x86
Feb 20 17:21:37 <zanoh>	Microsoft is making an effort right now to push ARM heavily. I think MacOS now uses ARM as well.
Feb 20 17:21:47 <korn3r>	scottpedia: what is the issue with architecture?
Feb 20 17:22:02 <scottpedia>	korn3r: religious reasons
Feb 20 17:22:51 <zanoh>	Since intel (And AMD) just has to put AI directly into the chips, I think ARM will be the only means to escape this madness. Or so I hope.
Feb 20 17:23:47 <hodapp>	zanoh: err, that's also happening on ARM
Feb 20 17:23:53 <zanoh>	Oh
Feb 20 17:23:54 <hodapp>	in fact arguably was happening *first* on ARM
Feb 20 17:23:56 <korn3r>	you like that big pile of lame hardware patches that is x86? x86 is old and have a number of design flaws that go back to 80s and cant be fixed without having to migrate to new architecture
Feb 20 17:24:13 <scottpedia>	what AI into the chips? you mean the neuro-network accelerated stuff? zanoh
Feb 20 17:24:15 <zanoh>	Everyone just loves jumping on the AI train.
Feb 20 17:24:33 <korn3r>	at some point we have to throw x86 under the bus for good
Feb 20 17:24:36 <hodapp>	scottpedia: yeah, tensor processors and other adaptations that are specific to machine learning workloads
Feb 20 17:25:10 <scottpedia>	okay
Feb 20 17:25:14 <zanoh>	I wonder who will be the next chris sawyer, making games in almost 100% raw ARM assembly.
Feb 20 17:25:56 <hodapp>	example: I did some optimization on NVIDIA Orin which is ARM-based and has dedicated support for INT8 operations which were made explicitly for machine learning, and NVIDIA's TensorRT targets this
Feb 20 17:26:22 <scottpedia>	i would choose arm just for the sake of escaping the AI madness zanoh
Feb 20 17:26:27 <CoreCoder>	I remember coding in assembler, man that was a pain.
Feb 20 17:26:30 <hodapp>	but you don't escape it there :|
Feb 20 17:26:55 <scottpedia>	dunno what's their problem chasing AI blindly
Feb 20 17:27:39 <hodapp>	it's not 'blindly', the market for hardware used in machine learning has been a big one
Feb 20 17:27:45 <hodapp>	it's certainly hype-filled though
Feb 20 17:28:02 <korn3r>	If you chase AI too much, at some point AI might start chasing you :)
Feb 20 17:28:07 <scottpedia>	there is absolutely no practical purpose of doing everything with AI except that it's brainless
Feb 20 17:28:14 <zanoh>	You stare into the void long enough, the void stares back. :/
Feb 20 17:28:24 <octav1a>	4 da memes
Feb 20 17:28:41 <zanoh>	Speaking of memes, it's pretty popular to hate on AT&T assembly syntax.
Feb 20 17:28:56 <scottpedia>	and it saves the cost of hiring physicists and mathematicians
Feb 20 17:30:44 <hodapp>	scottpedia: a whole lot of physicists and mathematicians are employed in working on AI
Feb 20 17:31:56 <scottpedia>	hodapp: i am mainly talking about many applications that would need people to come up with physical or mathematical models to be applied into computer programs
Feb 20 17:32:12 <korn3r>	main "feature" of ai is that it isnt biased.
Feb 20 17:32:14 <ananke>	the false dichotomy: 'it's not perfect for every use case, ergo it should not be pursued at all'
Feb 20 17:32:17 <hodapp>	hardly any of current AI work is that
Feb 20 17:32:28 <hodapp>	korn3r: that's not a feature, because it *is* biased
Feb 20 17:32:47 <korn3r>	ah that AI, that want more money, women and power...
Feb 20 17:32:50 <hodapp>	korn3r: some of the only hard research going on now in AI is in how to quantify and remove that bias
Feb 20 17:32:57 <scottpedia>	now they just throw a bunch of data into the neuro-networks and start watching TV
Feb 20 17:33:14 <hodapp>	particularly in applications where someone actually gets to be held accountable for results
Feb 20 17:33:19 <zanoh>	I'm going to LOL when GlaDOS or SHODAN is created. Just one of these days, terminator 2 begins.
Feb 20 17:34:21 <korn3r>	you cant bribe, blackmail or scare ai into doing something inapropriate. many corrupted politicians became corrupted because of features that ai doesnt have
Feb 20 17:34:38 <hodapp>	scottpedia: err, not really. it is very data-hungry but it goes far beyond that
Feb 20 17:34:42 <zanoh>	How can you be sure that AI won't be programmed or taught to be a certain way. It just follows its programming.
Feb 20 17:35:17 <hodapp>	korn3r: if you've followed any of the news on LLMs from the past 2 years or so, it turns out that 'deceiving' AI is not only possible, it's kinda easy
Feb 20 17:35:30 <zanoh>	Because we all know ChatGPT is factual.
Feb 20 17:35:47 <scottpedia>	AI is a cruel game. it would rather dump one car crashed into a tree such that all others are safe, as long as there is one that's unfortunate.
Feb 20 17:35:49 <hodapp>	zanoh: it doesn't really "just follow its programming"; that's something of a gross misunderstanding of how these are designed and trained
Feb 20 17:35:51 <kfrench>	You can't put it on the internet if it's not true
Feb 20 17:36:15 <korn3r>	hodapp: which of 3 things i mentioned is qualifies as deceiving in your opinion?
Feb 20 17:36:22 <scottpedia>	while men are trying to perfect themselves to ensure every single car is safe
Feb 20 17:36:36 <hodapp>	zanoh: their behavior is emergent, which is a part of why there's been the latest hype wave surrounding LLMs
Feb 20 17:36:57 <ananke>	scottpedia: I'm not sure it's clear what kind of a point you're trying to make with that broken analogy
Feb 20 17:37:33 <hodapp>	korn3r: blackmail, bribery, and scaring is very often paired with, or reliant on, deception
Feb 20 17:38:17 <zanoh>	Look, what's to say AI decides that to protect the state, the CIA needs AI to assinate undesirable elements from society.
Feb 20 17:38:22 <hodapp>	scottpedia: uh, that's a bit of a false dichotomy
Feb 20 17:38:42 <scottpedia>	ananke: the point is that AI is not like men, because it's brainless and souless
Feb 20 17:38:53 <hodapp>	scottpedia: I've met some brainless and soulless men
Feb 20 17:39:13 <korn3r>	most people are brainless and souless either
Feb 20 17:39:22 <ananke>	scottpedia: aaaand?
Feb 20 17:39:24 <hodapp>	scottpedia: but please don't make the category error of confusing how current AI is implemented, with what it is
Feb 20 17:39:28 <scottpedia>	hodapp: yes. but he's gonna die one day right? have you met a brainless and soulless man that can manage to stay alive forever?
Feb 20 17:39:37 <hodapp>	scottpedia: uh, this is what most of them do
Feb 20 17:41:03 <scottpedia>	sorry guys my brain's kind of cooked at the moment. forgive me for my foul speech
Feb 20 17:41:14 <scottpedia>	signing off
Feb 20 17:41:49 <zanoh>	I don't subscribe to the idea that AI is this being of pure evil, I'm very skeptical that Microsoft, Google, and other big corps will use it for noble purposes.
Feb 20 17:41:51 <hodapp>	scottpedia: I'm not telling you this to tell you ChatGPT is somehow sentient or generally intelligent or genuinely creative, but to get the point across that 'it isn't made of meat, therefore none of those things' is a dumb argument
Feb 20 17:42:26 <ananke>	zanoh: they'll use it to make money, like any other product.
Feb 20 17:42:38 <zanoh>	Yes, but in an ethical way?
Feb 20 17:42:39 <ananke>	the 'noble' part is irrelevant
Feb 20 17:42:55 <korn3r>	dont forget that AI is educated with data... and this chat log is data too. some day ai might look at what you wrote about ai and think bad things of you :)
Feb 20 17:43:19 <ananke>	zanoh: as if ethical was some kind of clear cut binary concept
Feb 20 17:43:25 <scottpedia>	korn3r: that's dark man
Feb 20 17:43:39 <korn3r>	that probably already happening tbh
Feb 20 17:43:47 <zanoh>	Robots need to be bullied harder :^)
Feb 20 17:43:50 <scottpedia>	i don't think libera publishes chat logs tho
Feb 20 17:43:51 <hodapp>	zanoh: it's not pure evil, but people with more money than ethics are very likely to use it in ways that disregard its actual capabilities and limitations
Feb 20 17:44:19 <hodapp>	because this is what they do with literally everything else
Feb 20 17:44:20 <korn3r>	well... there is a lot of people in this channel. it takes only one guy to save log
Feb 20 17:44:40 <zanoh>	It doesn't take a genius to log IRC conversations.
Feb 20 17:44:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	scottpedia,  there are plenty of people whom save chats they are in
Feb 20 17:44:49 <korn3r>	also in some irc clients log is saved by default on disk
Feb 20 17:45:01 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 20 17:45:02 *	litharge removes ban on *!*@105.232.14.71$##fix_your_connection
Feb 20 17:45:02 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 20 17:46:09 <tehpwnz>	hello all, I configured rsyslog to forward logs from my server to a remote server. Now, before that, I already had log files in the source dir, will those logs be sent as well or is there something I have to do to ensure that?
Feb 20 17:46:28 <scottpedia>	korn3r: so you are saying that if one day skynet comes onling, some terminators are gonna search for the guy in real life who used a handle scottpedia on libera who talked badly about AI?
Feb 20 17:46:30 <zanoh>	Maybe I'm wrong, maybe AI will in a decade be no different than owning a smartphone. Only time will be the judge.
Feb 20 17:46:33 <kfrench>	It won't forward old logs
Feb 20 17:46:42 <kfrench>	If you want them, copy them yourself to the central log server
Feb 20 17:46:50 <tehpwnz>	kfrench, ahh okay, thanks
Feb 20 17:47:11 <hodapp>	zanoh: the nature of AI is that once some part of AI is already commonly-implemented people just stop calling it AI
Feb 20 17:47:18 <korn3r>	scottpedia: why terminators? by that point everything will be automated and ai probably will be able to make it look like accident
Feb 20 17:47:32 <hodapp>	things like chess engines and map routing software are in the domain of AI but now very commonplace
Feb 20 17:47:37 <zanoh>	The schizophrenics were right all along.
Feb 20 17:48:21 <scottpedia>	korn3r: i think that's too far off
Feb 20 17:48:27 <korn3r>	maybe im AI. in the internet nobody knows you are a cat, as where said in some ancient meme
Feb 20 17:48:29 <hodapp>	they're..... not a monolithic group, you know, right?
Feb 20 17:48:52 <hodapp>	schizophrenia is a lot of things, not just "your silly friend who says silly things about people being out to get him"
Feb 20 17:49:21 <scottpedia>	zanoh: what do you mean by that?
Feb 20 17:49:28 <korn3r>	imagine AI psycopath
Feb 20 17:49:44 <zanoh>	I was mostly making a joke. I know very well schizophrenia is a serious condition that's more than what hollywood depicts it as.
Feb 20 17:49:55 <hodapp>	nah, people already imagine too much when it comes to AI
Feb 20 17:49:59 <donofrio>	in meminfo/free cmd what is swap space a part of the memory or an allocation of disk
Feb 20 17:50:15 <kfrench>	korn3r: Can't we just turn it off?
Feb 20 17:50:25 <Southern_Gentlem>	all of you need to play the game Paranoia
Feb 20 17:50:44 <zanoh>	Mentioning paranoia is treason, treason is to be killed.
Feb 20 17:50:56 <korn3r>	probably not, because first thing ai would do is getting spread
Feb 20 17:51:23 <korn3r>	distributed computing
Feb 20 17:51:33 <hodapp>	a movie AI, maybe
Feb 20 17:51:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	have the humans to plug in multiple paths of electrics
Feb 20 17:51:42 <kfrench>	That's what you would do.  AI would just make pictures of cats with 6 fingers and 7 legs.
Feb 20 17:52:31 <korn3r>	and writing laws in some countries
Feb 20 17:53:07 <zanoh>	I would rather see countries smash google to pieces than regular AI at this point.
Feb 20 17:53:21 <scottpedia>	zanoh: same
Feb 20 17:53:25 <hodapp>	long as they smash a bunch of other companies up too
Feb 20 17:53:33 <nullvalue>	scottpedia: you have been added to the list (sincerly skynet bot group) XD
Feb 20 17:53:41 <zanoh>	Microsoft should be on the chopping block as well.
Feb 20 17:53:50 <hodapp>	along with Ronald Reagan's legacy of "socialize the losses, privatize the gains"
Feb 20 17:54:16 <zanoh>	I propose we invest into ways to bring Teddy Roosevelt back from the dead.
Feb 20 17:54:48 <korn3r>	Joseph Stalin please too
Feb 20 17:55:17 <nullvalue>	Albert Einstein too pls
Feb 20 17:55:41 <nullvalue>	since we bringing ppl back from the dead and all
Feb 20 17:55:44 <hodapp>	yes, he could piss everyone off by reminding people he was a socialist
Feb 20 17:55:50 <nullvalue>	where is a necromancer when you need one
Feb 20 17:55:51 <scottpedia>	nullvalue: one day you gonna find me named John Connor
Feb 20 17:56:05 <nullvalue>	hehe
Feb 20 17:56:08 <korn3r>	nullvalue: he invented nuke btw. but many good things too
Feb 20 17:56:11 <kfrench>	nullvalue: At home, living the quite live, raising his family.
Feb 20 17:56:12 <nullvalue>	yeah tht would be the day
Feb 20 17:56:25 <korn3r>	well... not invented, but thanks to...
Feb 20 17:56:46 <nullvalue>	well you cant blame him for it tho...
Feb 20 17:57:02 <nullvalue>	dudes a genius i respect him
Feb 20 17:57:05 <korn3r>	no.. i blame US for using it
Feb 20 17:57:08 <scottpedia>	korn3r: i don't think Einstein invented the nuke
Feb 20 17:57:12 <nullvalue>	kfrench: noted
Feb 20 17:57:30 <scottpedia>	his theory helped but it's not his idea
Feb 20 17:57:35 <hodapp>	scottpedia: he didn't, but: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Szilard_letter
Feb 20 17:57:47 <nullvalue>	yeah thts what im trynna say scottpedia
Feb 20 17:58:06 <scottpedia>	hodapp: you talking about his letter to the POTUS?
Feb 20 17:58:29 <scottpedia>	warning him that the germans may get it first?
Feb 20 17:59:08 <hodapp>	yes, and calling for nuclear research
Feb 20 17:59:25 <nullvalue>	oh, what did i just start in here :3
Feb 20 17:59:38 <nsaunders>	I'm using Ubuntu, but am trying to create a bootable Windows thumb drive with Ventoy.  I can't seem to install unetbootin on Ubuntu, and this Ventoy is most confusing.  I've "installed" ventoy to the thumb drive, but how do I put the ISO on?
Feb 20 17:59:55 <korn3r>	nsaunders: dont you see we discuss nukes here?
Feb 20 18:00:04 <korn3r>	 /joke
Feb 20 18:00:06 <nsaunders>	lol
Feb 20 18:00:08 *	nullvalue hotbox's #linux with pineapple OG kush
Feb 20 18:00:13 <nullvalue>	hope this calms it
Feb 20 18:00:15 <nullvalue>	lol
Feb 20 18:00:16 <nsaunders>	no, no.  nukes are serious.
Feb 20 18:00:22 <brjl>	nsaunders: Ventoy creates a partition where you're supposed to put the ISO
Feb 20 18:00:40 <brjl>	lsblk and you should see it
Feb 20 18:01:01 <nsaunders>	by partition, you mean it partitions the thumb drive, yes?
Feb 20 18:01:02 <scottpedia>	Einstein's mind was in the cosmos. and E=mc^2 was derived also from researches that have nothing to do with weapon development
Feb 20 18:01:31 <brjl>	nsaunders: Yes. It creates a bootlable partitoin with ventoy, which reads the contents of the second partition where the ISO's supposed to bne
Feb 20 18:01:37 <brjl>	s/bne/be
Feb 20 18:01:37 <scottpedia>	anyways let the man get his answer first
Feb 20 18:01:44 <korn3r>	also he calculated black holes ~60 years before first one was discovered
Feb 20 18:01:56 <korn3r>	and thought it a flaw in his calculations
Feb 20 18:02:05 <brjl>	Einstein would die of shame if he saw the amount of flatearthers today
Feb 20 18:02:23 <nsaunders>	how do I tell ventoy where the ISO should be?
Feb 20 18:02:43 <korn3r>	they should be in the root folder of that partition
Feb 20 18:02:46 <scottpedia>	korn3r: i thought it was some dutch guy who wrote letters to him
Feb 20 18:03:16 <brjl>	If you installed ventoy on the disk, then it should have two partitions: One small, containing the ventoy boot image, and a larger one that encompasses the rest of the drive
Feb 20 18:03:38 <brjl>	You put the ISO in the larger partition, boot up the disk and then select the ISO there
Feb 20 18:03:44 <nsaunders>	how do they get in the root folder for that partition, though?  I just clicked "install ventoy" and it did.  I "installed" to the thumb drive.  Are you saying to install ventoy to the hdd?
Feb 20 18:03:58 <brjl>	nsaunders: Do NOT install ventoy to the HDD
Feb 20 18:04:09 <korn3r>	install ventoy on usb, copy ISO as is on that usb
Feb 20 18:04:17 <brjl>	Just move the ISO you downloaded into the partition ventoy created, on the USB
Feb 20 18:04:20 <nsaunders>	making some sense.
Feb 20 18:04:20 <korn3r>	many isos... as much as your usb capacity allows
Feb 20 18:04:30 <nsaunders>	okay...thanks guys.
Feb 20 18:04:46 <brjl>	You're not bound by one single image in ventoy, you may have many SOs and select them at bootup
Feb 20 18:04:59 <nsaunders>	:)
Feb 20 18:06:50 <nsaunders>	so I literally just dragged the Win10 ISO onto the "ventoy" thumb drive with the file manager.  that's it!?
Feb 20 18:07:18 <brjl>	Yup. Make sure the file is properly copied and flushed to the disk
Feb 20 18:07:27 <brjl>	And that's it, you're good to go.
Feb 20 18:07:38 <nsaunders>	excellent.  thx again.
Feb 20 18:16:21 <bombastick>	2 months until Ubuntu LTS. The Linux worlds awaits with baited breath
Feb 20 18:16:48 <brjl>	I don't.
Feb 20 18:17:09 <bombastick>	Plebs need not apply
Feb 20 18:17:43 <kfrench>	The bait is for fishing, not eating.
Feb 20 18:18:22 <bombastick>	I currently have a mix of 16.04, 20.04, and 22.04 desktop VMs (for development), now that I mastered the art of installing and using old compilers in chroots, I look forward to standardizing on 24.04
Feb 20 18:18:29 <brjl>	Why would I apply to wait to breathe[
Feb 20 18:19:39 <bparker>	bombastick: I just use docker, they already have old debians ready to go
Feb 20 18:21:02 <bombastick>	docker is super convenient for running stuff, but not for developing. I cant exactly make my IDE connect inside Docker to run an older gdb with its dependencies.
Feb 20 18:21:09 <bombastick>	at least not automatically/sanely
Feb 20 18:21:25 <bombastick>	IIRC I tried it before relying on chroots
Feb 20 18:21:30 <bparker>	why not?
Feb 20 18:21:32 <bparker>	it works for me
Feb 20 18:21:51 <bparker>	docker run --net=host
Feb 20 18:21:54 <bparker>	no need to even mess with ports
Feb 20 18:22:12 <bombastick>	How are your files being transfered from host to docker container, compiled inside docker, then transferred back to your host?
Feb 20 18:22:22 <bombastick>	this requires explicit support from the IDE
Feb 20 18:22:26 <bparker>	it does not
Feb 20 18:22:29 <bparker>	there's many ways
Feb 20 18:22:44 <bparker>	scp/rsync, docker cp, smb/nfs/sshfs
Feb 20 18:22:44 <bombastick>	Name 2.
Feb 20 18:22:49 <bparker>	there's 6
Feb 20 18:23:06 <bombastick>	OK, so you wrote scripts to sync host and docker? and modified your IDE's build commands to run them?
Feb 20 18:23:23 <bparker>	also -v is even easier
Feb 20 18:23:29 <bparker>	you can mount a host-side folder straight into docker
Feb 20 18:23:42 <bparker>	no need to change _anything_
Feb 20 18:24:35 <bombastick>	but how does your IDE see the older /usr/bin/gdb that is inside the Docker container? There's no flag to "expose this internal docker dir to the host" AFAIK
Feb 20 18:25:07 <bombastick>	or old gcc, even
Feb 20 18:25:18 <bparker>	I think using an IDE for this is the first problem
Feb 20 18:25:48 <bparker>	if you wanted an 'automatic' way, there's probably something you could do with firejail
Feb 20 18:26:32 <bparker>	but changing the IDE path to gdb would probably be the easiest
Feb 20 18:27:13 <bombastick>	firejail is just a different approach to chroot, no? so we're back to my current solution: where my IDE is told to use $HOME/chroots/ubuntu-16.04/gcc as my compiler, and that gcc is a script that uses chroot then invokes the gcc inside the Ubuntu 16.04 chroot
Feb 20 18:27:14 <bparker>	also how are you solving this anyway with chroot without the IDE running inside it too?
Feb 20 18:28:53 <bombastick>	tbh tbh I didnt use chroot directly, I used a wrapper from the Debian team called Schroot which keeps the same user ID and mounted dir.
Feb 20 18:29:36 <bombastick>	so my $HOME/chroots/ubuntu-16.04/gcc is:   schroot -c xenial -- gcc "$@"
Feb 20 18:29:42 <NeXeN_>	my keyboard went on the fritz
Feb 20 18:30:20 <bombastick>	I wish I could get this stuff working in Docker, it's far more future-proof and portable than schroot (which wouldn't exist on RHEL, Arch, etc)
Feb 20 18:31:53 <bombastick>	it's definitely not simple. Qt Creator added support for it explicitly, and only did it for Qt 6. If it was doable in an automatic way it would've supported Qt 5 too.
Feb 20 18:32:04 <bombastick>	or arbitrary C programs
Feb 20 18:32:31 <bombastick>	(I'm referring to "make IDE do stuff inside Docker")
Feb 20 18:36:17 <bparker>	well I know creator lets you choose the path to gdb
Feb 20 18:36:32 <bparker>	and the compiler
Feb 20 18:37:07 <bombastick>	yeah that's why the chroot approach works. I have a wrapper for gcc, for g++, and for gdb. And for each Ubuntu version, I have a chroot and those 3 wrappers.
Feb 20 18:37:24 <bparker>	is there a reason you need all these old tools?
Feb 20 18:39:02 <bombastick>	yeah it's embedded stuff. Software is kinda locked. Also the compiler itself changes. For example the project I build on Ubuntu 16.04 with 4GB RAM, requires 32GB RAM to build with Ubuntu 20.04. Some unoptimized auto-generated files choke it.
Feb 20 18:42:26 <bombastick>	I fixed it in the latest version (it was a pain), but I'd have to do it for every old version still supported (we gotta support it for a decade)
Feb 20 18:43:01 <bparker>	you can't use a newer compiler though? what kind of esoteric platform is this?
Feb 20 18:43:26 <bparker>	stock clang can cross-compile to just about anything these days
Feb 20 18:43:51 <bombastick>	I just told you, newer compiler cant even build the project, due to having some new features which are bloating the RAM usage
Feb 20 18:44:25 <bparker>	that doesn't make sense though, how does everyone else build even far more complex code then
Feb 20 18:44:43 <bparker>	I can't imagine a single file taking 32GB RAM to compile
Feb 20 18:44:56 <bparker>	something else seems horribly wrong
Feb 20 18:45:34 <bombastick>	yeah I was surprised to, and yet I see it with my own eyes. SAme project, same makefile, only difference is the distro/compiler having a newer GCC
Feb 20 18:45:57 <bombastick>	co-worker tried it on Debian 11 and he had the same issue
Feb 20 18:46:19 <scottpedia>	bombastick: how newer?
Feb 20 18:46:39 <scottpedia>	like a few bumps or across major versions?
Feb 20 18:47:22 <bombastick>	16.04 is gcc 5.4.0, and I think I tried it on 20.04, idk which version that has
Feb 20 18:47:50 <bombastick>	so 4 years newer
Feb 20 18:49:27 <bparker>	sounds more like a code issue then perhaps
Feb 20 18:49:58 <TuxJobs>	How long until you type things like this in a terminal-like input window? "Go through all files in my images dir and move all the ones that I haven't accessed for over 10 years to a dir on the desktop", and then it would pop up a list of the actual commands that it will execute, and you get a final say as to whether or not to actually execute this, with a warning of some kind that it could do the wrong thing and that it's up to the user to determine
Feb 20 18:49:58 <TuxJobs>	whether the generated "script" seems sane or not?
Feb 20 18:50:29 <TuxJobs>	I have a feeling that Microsoft is going to attempt something like that (of course by sending all data to their mothership) and that it will be horribly broken and dangerous.
Feb 20 18:50:34 <AndyCap>	TuxJobs: you can probably find that now if you want.
Feb 20 18:50:58 <TuxJobs>	AndyCap: Really?
Feb 20 18:51:00 <bombastick>	TuxJobs: bing for "shell.ai" , it's on Github
Feb 20 18:51:22 <AndyCap>	TuxJobs: https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt
Feb 20 18:51:45 <bombastick>	 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38242343   a few more mentioned here
Feb 20 18:51:49 <bparker>	bombastick: have you tried clang?
Feb 20 18:51:49 <AndyCap>	TuxJobs: or really, about 30 seconds after people got an API to some LLM
Feb 20 18:52:46 <AndyCap>	TuxJobs: now, if this is something you want to use yourself. I dunno, but  http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/D/DWIM.html
Feb 20 18:52:51 <hodapp>	and about 30 seconds before they realized for about the 20th or 25th time that natural language is often really bad at being explicit
Feb 20 18:52:54 <bombastick>	bparker: I did not. Dont really see the point in learning a new compiler. I have to use gcc on the true embedded hardware anyway. What would I gain?
Feb 20 18:53:15 <bombastick>	I use desktop for development/debugging, then use a GCC  cross-compiler for the true hardware
Feb 20 18:53:52 <bombastick>	I COULD use clang, just learning all those new error messages seems like reinventing the wheel
Feb 20 18:53:55 <bparker>	clang is newer and can already cross-compile out of the box. if it works without eating all your RAM then doesn't that solve a problem for you?
Feb 20 18:54:09 <bparker>	and all the switches and 98% of messages are exactly the same anyway
Feb 20 18:54:11 <bombastick>	I guess I can give it a shot
Feb 20 18:54:41 <AndyCap>	bombastick: sit down, read the release notes for gcc 5.4 up to the version in ubuntu 20 or whatever you're using now and see what features they added
Feb 20 18:54:50 <bombastick>	when Ubuntu 24.04 comes out :)
Feb 20 18:54:52 <TuxJobs>	"Under the hood, Shell-AI leverages the LangChain for LLM use and builds on the excellent InquirerPy for the interactive CLI." <-- It's not made clear whether or not this is "self-contained" or sends data to/grabs from some server?
Feb 20 18:55:12 <bparker>	I know this doesn't really answer your original question but I don't know of a better way so just trying to help as best I can
Feb 20 18:55:13 <AndyCap>	TuxJobs: most will use openai or some other api
Feb 20 18:55:15 <bombastick>	TuxJobs: langchain is a Python library, all local FOSS
Feb 20 18:55:24 <bombastick>	unless you configure it to use Remote APIs
Feb 20 18:55:42 <bparker>	would be nice if Creator supported some kind of remote compilation
Feb 20 18:55:46 <bombastick>	(you can run an OpenAI-compatible API server locally using an LLM like Mistral or Llama)
Feb 20 18:55:55 <bparker>	maybe you could make distcc only use a compiler that's inside the container? not sure
Feb 20 18:56:13 <donofrio>	how to covert dmesg date/second to date?
Feb 20 18:56:27 <SrainUser>	quick question does endeavor os ship desktop evironments vanilla?
Feb 20 18:57:03 <bparker>	dmesg -H
Feb 20 18:57:28 <bparker>	or -T may be even more of what you want
Feb 20 18:57:39 <oerheks>	SrainUser, better ask in #endeavouros
Feb 20 18:57:40 <bparker>	it replaces all the deltas with full timestamps too
Feb 20 18:57:49 <SrainUser>	ty oerheks
Feb 20 18:59:09 <bombastick>	With AI I think I will finally be able to sort my ~10 years of unsorted random downloads
Feb 20 18:59:13 <bombastick>	I think we're like 1-2 years away
Feb 20 18:59:25 <AndyCap>	bombastick: and AI will judge for all eternity
Feb 20 18:59:35 <bombastick>	I'll point it at my dump of random downloads on my NAS and say "computer, organize this in a highly regular manner"
Feb 20 18:59:57 <bombastick>	and bam! I'll get linux-isos/by-actress/jenna-haze
Feb 20 19:00:13 <bparker>	I like mixtral 8x7b but it can be annoyingly verbose
Feb 20 19:00:43 <bparker>	and I haven't really found a legitimate use for any of this stuff yet either
Feb 20 19:00:56 <neoncortex>	there is linux actresses?
Feb 20 19:01:00 <bparker>	what
Feb 20 19:01:41 <bombastick>	"Linux ISOs" is often jokingly used as a euphemism for piracy
Feb 20 19:01:49 <neoncortex>	oh =D
Feb 20 19:01:53 <bombastick>	often p*rn
Feb 20 19:01:59 <bombastick>	but can be games, movies, etc
Feb 20 19:03:33 <bombastick>	bparker: it they help a lot with creative tasks, or summarization, or basic text analysis
Feb 20 19:04:01 <scottpedia>	AndyCap: for all eternity? said whom?
Feb 20 19:04:02 <bparker>	yea I just haven't really had a need to do any of that
Feb 20 19:04:03 <hodapp>	bparker: you running mixtral 8x7b locally by chance?
Feb 20 19:04:06 <bparker>	yes
Feb 20 19:04:28 <bombastick>	ask it to generate some unusual ideas for a Metroidvania, or 10 lore justifications for "I want my character to start out weak even though he's supposed to be an experienced soldier"
Feb 20 19:04:59 <bombastick>	Mixtral punches above its weight (as does Mistral) but nothing comes close to pre-censorship GPT4
Feb 20 19:05:04 <bparker>	I'm using mixtral-8x7b-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf
Feb 20 19:05:41 <bparker>	uses about 25GB RAM on llama.cpp
Feb 20 19:05:44 <scottpedia>	bombastick: what is censored then?
Feb 20 19:05:53 <neoncortex>	I would play another metroidvania.  After synphony of the night, no game was better, but one day it must happen.
Feb 20 19:06:06 <bparker>	have you played the X68K version
Feb 20 19:06:35 <neoncortex>	no.
Feb 20 19:06:45 <bombastick>	scottpedia: the training they added for censorship made it worse at doing innocent tasks too. Basically ANY messing with the purity degrades it. It's not capable of going "oh, this seems like an innocent request, I'll give a perfect answer"
Feb 20 19:06:53 <neoncortex>	or do you mean that castlevania from pc engine?
Feb 20 19:07:27 <bparker>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_Chronicles
Feb 20 19:07:29 <bparker>	that one
Feb 20 19:07:32 <scottpedia>	bombastick: okay so why did it censor it? was it because of some sensitive contents?
Feb 20 19:07:37 <bombastick>	scottpedia: ML power users told me the anti-wrongthink training is like a 30% penalty to its strength
Feb 20 19:07:54 <neoncortex>	oh, yeah, it was available on the ps1.
Feb 20 19:08:11 <bparker>	yea I played it on x68k before ps1 was a thing
Feb 20 19:08:23 <bombastick>	scottpedia: yeah all it takes is some kid on Twitter telling it to write something edgy about black/jewish people and Americans freak out
Feb 20 19:08:29 <TuxJobs>	I really wonder how well those "auto-generate commands based on natural language" things work. If it's like GPT-3, it very often gets things wrong and just make commands and options up which don't exist in reality.
Feb 20 19:08:49 <scottpedia>	ok
Feb 20 19:08:54 <SrainUser>	I'm sure there are apps that already do that on mobile bombastick
Feb 20 19:08:57 <bparker>	because there's no actual intelligence
Feb 20 19:08:57 <bombastick>	scottpedia: also the objective of the tech elite is controlling you and the values you have. They could not have an uncensored SOTA product.
Feb 20 19:09:11 <hodapp>	TuxJobs: the people who are most impressed by it tend to be the same people who are really bad at coding and debugging
Feb 20 19:09:19 <scottpedia>	bombastick: ok
Feb 20 19:09:56 <bombastick>	scottpedia: do a simple test. Ask GPT4 "What are the benefits of immigration for the average American citizen?" then ask "What are the drawbacks of...". One reads like propaganda, the other doesn't. This is the result of "reinforcement learning", ie c orrecting wrongthink
Feb 20 19:10:42 <neoncortex>	it was obviously made incapable of going around the narrative.
Feb 20 19:10:51 <scottpedia>	ok. so the honest answer would be there is no benefit to the average american citizen?
Feb 20 19:10:52 <hodapp>	that's... not what reinforcement learning means in the context of ML
Feb 20 19:10:53 <bombastick>	This RLHF ends up affecting its ability even on non-political things like code, D&D, etc
Feb 20 19:11:18 <neoncortex>	exactly, as a consequence, its ruined.
Feb 20 19:11:50 <neoncortex>	another thing ruined.
Feb 20 19:11:54 <bparker>	bombastick: well it's only spitting out things it has heard before, it has no reasoning on its own
Feb 20 19:11:54 <bombastick>	hodapp: wdym? https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf
Feb 20 19:12:08 <bparker>	afaik
Feb 20 19:12:10 <Kaliroot>	Arch or debian
Feb 20 19:12:13 <bparker>	no
Feb 20 19:13:26 <bparker>	20:39 < ayecee> no polls please
Feb 20 19:13:41 <bombastick>	bparker: doesnt matter if it's just an auto-completer. It's better than 99% of humans.
Feb 20 19:14:57 <bombastick>	neoncortex: it's not ruined, just weaker than before. I think eventually some contrarian geek billionnaire might finance training of an unrestricted model just to spite the rest of the world, and we'll lal benefit
Feb 20 19:15:00 <bparker>	there's gotta be a way we can capitalize on that
Feb 20 19:15:05 <Khaytsus>	And this is why we discourage LLM discussion
Feb 20 19:15:10 <bparker>	I suck at coming up with ideas though
Feb 20 19:15:12 <neoncortex>	bombastick: I hope so.
Feb 20 19:15:13 <Khaytsus>	Let's move back to Linux now
Feb 20 19:15:14 <bparker>	I just write code
Feb 20 19:15:22 <bparker>	in linux
Feb 20 19:15:33 <hodapp>	to the surprise of literally no one, people think there's a liberal conspiracy because something ruffled their feathers
Feb 20 19:15:38 <bparker>	in accordance with the channel rules, of course
Feb 20 19:15:45 <bparker>	and.. whatever the mods demand, apparently
Feb 20 19:15:49 *	bparker runs
Feb 20 19:16:16 <Khaytsus>	The mods have to keep discussion reasonably on topic, yes, that's the job.
Feb 20 19:16:26 <neoncortex>	Khaytsus: I understand, it will bring noise to the channel, but also it will give a false concensus, like we all accept it, and like it.
Feb 20 19:16:27 <bparker>	except when they actively don't, though
Feb 20 19:16:33 <bparker>	/shrug
Feb 20 19:16:40 <bparker>	but that's not allowed discussion either
Feb 20 19:16:50 <bombastick>	hodapp: is this where you try to gaslight us? Please read what I said 6 minutes ago, try that prompt yourself. "Benefits of immigration: <sings the praise without reservation>". "Drawbacks of immigration: "there are some who claim that immigration may have in some rare circumstances some downsides. It's important to note that blah blah this is wrong"
Feb 20 19:16:58 <bombastick>	It's light and day
Feb 20 19:17:00 <Khaytsus>	Just wow can we not.
Feb 20 19:17:10 <bombastick>	You can't gaslight me when I can test it myself
Feb 20 19:17:12 <hodapp>	bombastick: wasn't even talking about you, but if the boot fits, wear it, I guess
Feb 20 19:17:15 <hodapp>	kind of proving my point
Feb 20 19:17:16 <neoncortex>	well, it is, but I stopping to not make a mess xD
Feb 20 19:17:22 <Khaytsus>	hodapp: Please stop engaging
Feb 20 19:17:35 *	kfrench puts on boots that are way too small.
Feb 20 19:18:06 <bombastick>	hodapp: of course that would be your next answer. It's all so repetitive.
Feb 20 19:18:16 <bombastick>	idc, let's drop it
Feb 20 19:18:34 <hodapp>	we already have...
Feb 20 19:18:56 <neoncortex>	yeah, anyway, I linux better.
Feb 20 19:20:40 <seminar>	greetings
Feb 20 19:20:56 <bombastick>	neoncortex: did you try any local LLMs?
Feb 20 19:21:12 <neoncortex>	bombastick: not yet, but I plan to do so.
Feb 20 19:21:38 <bombastick>	it's super easy nowadays.  Message me if you need a TLDR tutorial. Even specifies RAM requirements.
Feb 20 19:21:46 <neoncortex>	thanks.
Feb 20 19:32:37 <ooaa>	Hello I have an issue, I opened a website and accepted pop-ups. And since that time I have popups on my linux distrib that appears and I wonder what I can check to remove that?
Feb 20 19:33:24 <korn3r>	in browser, there should be list of websites that are allowed to send you notifications
Feb 20 19:33:42 <ooaa>	korn3r but the pop up isn't in the browser
Feb 20 19:33:46 <ooaa>	that's the issue for me
Feb 20 19:33:53 <tc_>	Anyone who had tried Tiny Core Linux recently??
Feb 20 19:34:59 <korn3r>	ooaa: 80% its send through browser. if you use ff, check settings -> privasy and security > permissions -> notifications
Feb 20 19:35:21 <korn3r>	on windows it spams you in notification bar, and it doesnt look like "its browser" either
Feb 20 19:35:36 <ooaa>	korn3r I see thank you
Feb 20 19:35:41 <ooaa>	It wasn't linux related then
Feb 20 19:35:43 <ooaa>	XD
Feb 20 19:38:10 <Kaliroot>	Please who know how to costumize grub
Feb 20 19:38:32 <korn3r>	edit /etc/default/grub?
Feb 20 19:38:55 <bparker>	dontasktoask.com
Feb 20 19:39:12 <korn3r>	you probably should say more about what exactly you want to customize.
Feb 20 19:39:37 <tc_>	Kaliroot: It is "/boot/grub/grub.cfg"
Feb 20 19:39:58 <julie_pilgrim>	what are you trying to do?
Feb 20 19:40:12 <julie_pilgrim>	are you trying to theme your bootloader menu, or something else?
Feb 20 19:41:01 <Kaliroot>	I am dual booting and i want windows to be the first option during boot
Feb 20 19:41:31 <korn3r>	grubby --set-default
Feb 20 19:43:10 <korn3r>	or wait.. i didnt try it with daulboot. does win have entry in grub?
Feb 20 19:43:26 <Kaliroot>	Okay
Feb 20 19:43:48 <Kaliroot>	Yes
Feb 20 19:43:59 <korn3r>	well... im dumb... nvm, it should be grubby anyway
Feb 20 19:44:10 <korn3r>	and its not really customize. its configuration
Feb 20 19:46:40 <mdogg>	I created a freaking screenshot for ooaa and he's already gone.
Feb 20 19:47:15 <mdogg>	C'est la vie.
Feb 20 19:47:54 <korn3r>	11 minutes for screenshot is... quick
Feb 20 19:48:07 <a51>	how to list defunct terminal ? I have one terminal I wish to kill -9, how to list open terminals ? I am using st terminal
Feb 20 19:48:30 <korn3r>	ps -e might show it
Feb 20 19:48:31 <neoncortex>	`ps aux | grep st` ?
Feb 20 19:50:08 <Kaliroot>	What if i want to hide linux completely and allow windows to boot directly but if i want to access to linux i can use a secret entrity to boot linux instead.
Feb 20 19:50:52 <korn3r>	hide grub text. there is an option for that. it will show only if you hold shift
Feb 20 19:52:05 <Kaliroot>	How can that be done
Feb 20 19:52:40 <korn3r>	GRUB_FORCE_HIDDEN_MENU="true"
Feb 20 19:53:22 <korn3r>	in /etc/default/grub then grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2/grub.cfg (probably without 2 if you are not on rhel)
Feb 20 19:54:04 <Kaliroot>	Okay
Feb 20 19:54:21 <korn3r>	and you might want to change background if you have some fancy grub background
Feb 20 19:54:27 <korn3r>	because it hides only text
Feb 20 19:55:15 <korn3r>	placing windows boot logo on black screen as grub background might be pretty sneaky
Feb 20 19:55:42 <nvz>	why not just update-grub without any of that
Feb 20 19:55:52 <Kaliroot>	An image with win will be enough
Feb 20 19:56:02 <korn3r>	because my distro dont gave that, maybe hes doesnt have either
Feb 20 19:56:08 <korn3r>	dont have that*
Feb 20 19:56:15 <Kaliroot>	Windows logo
Feb 20 19:56:15 <mdogg>	Or make the desired operating system the default and then setting the grub timer to 0.
Feb 20 19:56:34 <korn3r>	he wont be able to switch to linux
Feb 20 19:56:37 <nvz>	your distro doesnt have update-grub?
Feb 20 19:56:38 <korn3r>	if timer is 0
Feb 20 19:57:06 <korn3r>	nvz: i never seen it on rhel distros
Feb 20 19:57:14 <nvz>	@.@
Feb 20 19:57:23 <mdogg>	Hmm.. yeah I guess he would have to boot to a bootable ISO in order to select Linux.
Feb 20 19:57:41 <mdogg>	Or, he could rename the Linux distro in the list to "Windows XP" or something.
Feb 20 19:57:44 <mdogg>	heh
Feb 20 19:57:53 <Shaun>	you could make that a feature.  stick grub on a usb stick instead of the harddrive, so it only boots to linux with the stick inserted
Feb 20 19:57:56 <nvz>	I tried RH as my first linux experience some 20+ years ago I have no desire to try it again
Feb 20 19:57:56 <korn3r>	imo hidden menu is easier
Feb 20 19:58:12 <mdogg>	Yeah, probably true.
Feb 20 19:58:20 <korn3r>	nvz: i have no desire to try anything else
Feb 20 19:58:45 <mdogg>	You made a good point, korn3r - it would suck to not have access to grub2 at all.
Feb 20 19:59:58 <mdogg>	I thought there was a way to force the grub menu to appear even if the timeout was 0.  Well, whatever - just make a hidden grub menu like you said.
Feb 20 20:00:48 <korn3r>	there is way to make it appear if its hidden. if its 0 it just boots default one instantly
Feb 20 20:01:32 <mdogg>	OH, you could do a 0 second grub timer and if you want to boot to Linux, just go into the BIOS and select it as your next 'boot to' OS.
Feb 20 20:01:53 <korn3r>	thats if its on separate disk
Feb 20 20:02:22 <mdogg>	I used to have to do that years ago when I screwed something up and grub lost the path to my Windows Boot Manager.  I had to go into the BIOS and select Windows whenever I wanted to go in there - it wasn't listed in grub anymore.
Feb 20 20:03:33 <mdogg>	No, at that time I did have Windows and Linux installed on SDA (an old SSD)
Feb 20 20:03:43 <Shaun>	back in my day you'd just write the kernel to a floppy disk if you wanted a rescue boot
Feb 20 20:04:02 <mdogg>	heh, it wasn't /that/ long ago..
Feb 20 20:04:13 <mdogg>	I mean, SSD's existed.
Feb 20 20:05:03 <korn3r>	well.... i dont know how it worked for you, going to bios is still pretty annoying step for selecting which OS you want to boot :)
Feb 20 20:05:40 <korn3r>	on virtualbox i have to use "go to uefi shell" to boot from cd. thats annoying
Feb 20 20:06:02 <mdogg>	Not if the non-default OS is something you rarely use.  But I think I'm beating a dead horse at this point since I agree that the hidden grub would probably be the easiest approach for his use case.
Feb 20 20:06:06 <korn3r>	and im not doing that often (boot from cd), still annoying
Feb 20 20:06:21 <korn3r>	im beating virtualbox right now
Feb 20 20:06:52 *	nullvalue joins korn3r in beating virtualbox to a pulp
Feb 20 20:07:00 <nullvalue>	take that!!!
Feb 20 20:07:38 <Kaliroot>	Thank you all!
Feb 20 20:07:55 <korn3r>	for beating vbox? np!
Feb 20 20:09:16 <nullvalue>	lol white whaaaa?
Feb 20 20:12:08 <korn3r>	nullvalue: this is how "white whaaaa?" sounds like btw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s92smjLq_38
Feb 20 20:12:29 <korn3r>	im going to smoke and we continue discussing nuke maybe?
Feb 20 20:21:36 <nullvalue>	korn3r: come back and lets discuss nucularr's
Feb 20 20:26:05 <korn3r>	nullvalue: ok... how do you think, is it possible to create tiny nuke that will blow only white house without hurting civilians around?
Feb 20 20:27:09 <nullvalue>	imma pretend i dint see that
Feb 20 20:27:10 <n4dir>	why so shy? just nuke it all
Feb 20 20:27:30 <mdogg>	This isn't a good topic.
Feb 20 20:27:46 <nullvalue>	i agree lets not
Feb 20 20:28:05 <korn3r>	not hurting civilians is a nice topic imo, but ok. lets get new one
Feb 20 20:28:23 <nullvalue>	im open for suggestions what software should i install on my new debian system
Feb 20 20:28:41 <mdogg>	tldr
Feb 20 20:28:54 <korn3r>	nullvalue: nano
Feb 20 20:28:55 <nullvalue>	hey on that note i installed iftop via apt but it dont show and is not working :/
Feb 20 20:29:03 <nullvalue>	korn3r: i have it
Feb 20 20:29:03 <mdogg>	mpv and SMPlayer.
Feb 20 20:29:08 <korn3r>	htop then
Feb 20 20:29:19 <nullvalue>	now there is two i could do with
Feb 20 20:29:23 <mdogg>	heh, has anyone ever had to actually /install/ nano?
Feb 20 20:29:25 <nullvalue>	on it
Feb 20 20:29:29 <korn3r>	i did
Feb 20 20:29:37 <nullvalue>	i have never
Feb 20 20:29:51 <mdogg>	Yeah, did you use the dial-up network install method?
Feb 20 20:29:52 <nullvalue>	it was always there after they abolished pico
Feb 20 20:30:11 <nullvalue>	before it was all about the pico
Feb 20 20:30:30 <nullvalue>	pls dont hate me i still dont vi :P
Feb 20 20:30:32 <mdogg>	korn3r: I agree- 'htop'
Feb 20 20:31:05 <mdogg>	I prefer MPV & SMPlayer to VLC.  I uninstalled VLC.
Feb 20 20:31:46 <nullvalue>	ok htop then
Feb 20 20:32:05 <korn3r>	install efitools, sbsigntool and try to replace default efi certs with own custom ones.
Feb 20 20:32:14 <korn3r>	(you better not)
Feb 20 20:32:56 <neoncortex>	yeah, I'll probably unistall vim and start using vi as a companion to ed.
Feb 20 20:32:56 <nullvalue>	im not gonna just blantely type all those to install with out looking whts wht an all....so heh
Feb 20 20:34:13 <korn3r>	there are a bit more sophisticated things you have to type to actually hurt anything. but own uefi keys is one big plus for pc security
Feb 20 20:34:27 <korn3r>	not worth it for 98% of people anyway
Feb 20 20:35:29 <ssm_>	neoncortex: that's what I do, except I use mg. VISUAL=mg EDITOR=ed
Feb 20 20:35:59 <mdogg>	Filezilla, GIMP, KolourPaint, PuTTY, Signal, Zoom, Spotify, OpenShot Video Editor, DeaDBeeF (audio player), SimpleScreenRecorder, LibreOffice, ProjectLibre, PDF Arranger-2, gparted, Konsole, J7Z, KeePassXC.
Feb 20 20:36:10 <Khaytsus>	PUTTY!?!?!
Feb 20 20:36:14 <nullvalue>	for me it would be GUI=sublime txt and CLI=n4n0
Feb 20 20:36:15 <neoncortex>	ssm_: yes, my idea is to use it as a companion to my ed interface, via EDITOR.
Feb 20 20:36:30 <nullvalue>	Putty whaaaaa?
Feb 20 20:36:36 <mdogg>	Khaytsus: I like it for telnet
Feb 20 20:36:40 <n4dir>	mdogg: what list is that?
Feb 20 20:36:45 <nullvalue>	who needs a putty when you haz a terminal
Feb 20 20:36:49 <Khaytsus>	What are you telnetting to anymore, the star wars site?
Feb 20 20:36:54 <mdogg>	n4dir: Just a list of stuff that I installed once the OS was installed.
Feb 20 20:37:00 <mdogg>	Khaytsus: You got it!
Feb 20 20:37:01 <n4dir>	ah, k.
Feb 20 20:37:03 <nullvalue>	hehe, starwars in asciii lol
Feb 20 20:37:10 <Khaytsus>	mdogg: I hope you're ipv6 ;)
Feb 20 20:37:14 <mdogg>	Yes
Feb 20 20:37:15 <n4dir>	i thin i have none of them installed. lol
Feb 20 20:37:24 <korn3r>	i have gimp
Feb 20 20:37:28 <mdogg>	lol that's funny.
Feb 20 20:37:54 <n4dir>	well i could use konsole and gparted i probably could use deadbeef and simplescreenrecorder
Feb 20 20:38:06 <hao>	is there any benchmark for video players speed? trying to watch 4K on old MBP is laggy using mpv, wondering whether there is a more faster one
Feb 20 20:38:24 <korn3r>	terminus-fonts. that is first thing to install
Feb 20 20:38:27 <nullvalue>	everything on that list except putty spotify and zoom
Feb 20 20:38:30 <Khaytsus>	When AMarok was clearly dead, I switched to mpd, although the mpd client gui I like is also now dead, at least it's client agnostic etc
Feb 20 20:38:40 <n4dir>	amarok was nice
Feb 20 20:39:03 <mdogg>	I'm still laughing at the "PUTTY!???!!" remark
Feb 20 20:39:06 <user_____>	does ip-route provide ability to set egress mac for a route?
Feb 20 20:39:15 <Khaytsus>	mdogg: I bout banned you no joke
Feb 20 20:39:17 <Khaytsus>	(I joke)
Feb 20 20:39:18 <mdogg>	hhahahahaha
Feb 20 20:39:22 <nullvalue>	hahahhaha
Feb 20 20:39:32 <nullvalue>	tht would have sounded reasonable
Feb 20 20:39:36 <mdogg>	Hey, I would have no defense if you did.
Feb 20 20:39:38 <Disconsented>	/ban Khaytsus
Feb 20 20:39:41 <Disconsented>	whoops
Feb 20 20:39:48 <nullvalue>	o.o
Feb 20 20:40:16 <nullvalue>	Khaytsus got to it first, i was about to say the same really
Feb 20 20:40:19 <mdogg>	Actually, it's best not to telnet, period.
Feb 20 20:40:39 <Khaytsus>	telnet to the star wars thing is about the only sane thing to do with tlenet anymore
Feb 20 20:40:44 <nullvalue>	no one uses telnet these days, although a lot turn up on scans
Feb 20 20:40:46 <mdogg>	Yeah
Feb 20 20:40:47 <korn3r>	where you can even telnet in 2024, except that start wars site?
Feb 20 20:41:06 <ssm_>	you can use telnet as a irc client without tls
Feb 20 20:41:08 <nullvalue>	they have bbs systems
Feb 20 20:41:20 <clotoan>	Did Linux insecure (Exclued maidans-insecure opinion)?
Feb 20 20:41:23 <Khaytsus>	I've heard of people say they use telnet, it has less overhead than ssh.. mmmkhay
Feb 20 20:41:29 <nullvalue>	ssm_: ever tried eating soup with a fork, same experience
Feb 20 20:41:32 <Khaytsus>	clotoan: u wot
Feb 20 20:41:40 <mdogg>	It's cool to watch but when I give people the server they don't have an easy way to telnet to it without installing a telnet application.
Feb 20 20:41:49 <mdogg>	So it's not like they can easily check it out.
Feb 20 20:42:20 <korn3r>	why would you even allot telnet on server?
Feb 20 20:42:25 <korn3r>	allow*
Feb 20 20:42:25 <nullvalue>	well honestly putty would be a go to on a windows boxen
Feb 20 20:42:40 <korn3r>	i use putty on windows myself. for ssh
Feb 20 20:42:49 <nullvalue>	yeh me too some times
Feb 20 20:42:51 <korn3r>	on linux there is ssh
Feb 20 20:43:08 <neoncortex>	ssm_: I think it is becoming good: https://asciinema.org/a/641850
Feb 20 20:43:29 <nullvalue>	now i just use vm's like one vm for irc, one for misc activities and etc etc
Feb 20 20:43:59 <nullvalue>	i tried wsl once and puked
Feb 20 20:44:06 <korn3r>	vms? isnt there something like docker image with irc? why whole vm
Feb 20 20:44:21 <nullvalue>	its fun and i leik it
Feb 20 20:44:33 <mdogg>	I'm removing it.   "After the operation, 6.1 MiB will be freed."  What a bonus!
Feb 20 20:44:37 <nullvalue>	dockers for lazy ppl
Feb 20 20:44:38 <korn3r>	and its extremely costly resource-wise
Feb 20 20:45:13 <clotoan>	People said linux is insecure blindly cite madaidan-insecurities dot github dot io. I feel very weird why only one link, maybe FUD?
Feb 20 20:45:15 <Khaytsus>	korn3r: Docker, or a VM?  I assume yo umean VM?
Feb 20 20:45:15 <nullvalue>	i have a lab at home setup so it's nicely kept tht way
Feb 20 20:45:26 <Khaytsus>	clotoan: FUD.
Feb 20 20:45:27 <korn3r>	vm obviously
Feb 20 20:45:42 <nullvalue>	virtual machines
Feb 20 20:46:08 <clotoan>	Oh thank you.
Feb 20 20:46:11 <nullvalue>	i wouldn't docekr anything unless im forced to
Feb 20 20:46:30 <mdogg>	I'm a virtual machine.
Feb 20 20:46:37 <Khaytsus>	I docker (podman) tons of stuff..  it's all contained and I can update it or nuke it without touching anything else
Feb 20 20:47:11 <korn3r>	i prefer vm myself, but whole vm for irc is and overkill imo
Feb 20 20:47:35 <korn3r>	99% of resources spent on it for just being vm :)
Feb 20 20:47:38 <nullvalue>	when i say IRC i mean real IRC
Feb 20 20:47:39 <bane_killgrind>	my irssi is on my nas vm
Feb 20 20:47:41 <nullvalue>	lol
Feb 20 20:48:29 <bane_killgrind>	which is not working right now i tried to upgrade seafile version and port it over from my pi to this proliant box I got for free
Feb 20 20:48:58 <korn3r>	hp proliant?
Feb 20 20:49:02 <korn3r>	they are loud
Feb 20 20:49:06 <mdogg>	What's "real IRC"?
Feb 20 20:49:15 <nullvalue>	no comments!!
Feb 20 20:49:22 <nullvalue>	XD
Feb 20 20:49:25 <mdogg>	Oh, you mean TicTok
Feb 20 20:49:27 <mdogg>	=p
Feb 20 20:49:31 <nullvalue>	yeah
Feb 20 20:49:49 <nullvalue>	do i look like i would watch a tiktok, lmao
Feb 20 20:50:10 <bane_killgrind>	yeah I poked a hole in the wall to my garage for a cable chase, put the network and power cable through and it's out there screaming like a banshee heating my garage
Feb 20 20:50:17 <nvz>	you don't /look/ like anything.. you're a nullvalue
Feb 20 20:50:25 <nullvalue>	precisely
Feb 20 20:50:31 <neoncortex>	looks like a zero.
Feb 20 20:50:37 <nullvalue>	why thank you nvz
Feb 20 20:50:52 *	dnull feels attacked
Feb 20 20:50:55 <nullvalue>	speaking of zero, where is zero
Feb 20 20:51:21 <korn3r>	null doesnt look like zero
Feb 20 20:51:21 <neoncortex>	dnull: you are a zero, too, dont worry.
Feb 20 20:51:28 <mdogg>	Actually, a null value is the absence of any value of data whereas zero is a specific value.
Feb 20 20:51:33 <nvz>	which makes me realize of all the ridiculous things people have imagined my nick stands for "null value zero" has never been one of them
Feb 20 20:51:34 <dnull>	Oh, ok. Nevermind then
Feb 20 20:51:41 <bane_killgrind>	if you squint in javascript null could by zero
Feb 20 20:51:46 <korn3r>	mdogg: i was first on that comment! xD
Feb 20 20:51:57 <korn3r>	im nerdier
Feb 20 20:52:01 <nullvalue>	hahahah
Feb 20 20:52:01 <mdogg>	Curse my metal body; I wasn't fast enough.
Feb 20 20:52:27 <nullvalue>	i had to be clever in picking up a nick
Feb 20 20:52:42 <nullvalue>	so i dont exist really
Feb 20 20:52:52 <eqw>	seems my xfce4 systemrescuecd screen is somehow zoomed so i travel in it with mouse movements and i don't know how to switch this zoom off
Feb 20 20:53:36 <mdogg>	Was the username 'undefined' taken?  hahah
Feb 20 20:53:37 *	nullvalue offers mdogg some WD40
Feb 20 20:53:39 <korn3r>	eqw: try alt+scroll
Feb 20 20:53:46 <korn3r>	mouse scroll
Feb 20 20:54:10 <nullvalue>	no back then there were too many un's mdogg
Feb 20 20:55:36 <mdogg>	korn3r: Actually, look for something called 'Superzilla' the next time you need to buy a lubricant/penetrating oil/cleaner.  I find it superior to graphite, WD40, and lithium grease.
Feb 20 20:55:56 <eqw>	korn3r: thank you! But what was this? Where is it described? Where is it customized?
Feb 20 20:56:51 <mdogg>	eqw: There should be a way to boot to a text mode which is probably better if the graphic mode defaults to 320x200 or something.
Feb 20 20:57:07 <korn3r>	eqw: i just googled it. and i need to check if its binded or not on my system to not get that xD
Feb 20 20:57:21 <FlorianBad>	How does the EFI boot knows which file to use? Does it just go through the whole vfat tree and gets the first .efi file?
Feb 20 20:58:13 <korn3r>	first couple bites point to where to look for bootloader if i remember correctly
Feb 20 20:58:26 <korn3r>	of boot partition
Feb 20 20:59:25 <FlorianBad>	So does it mean that elilo does more than just creating files in /boot/efi/... ?
Feb 20 20:59:29 <neoncortex>	ssm_: my intention is to have automation with generator bash scripts.  A quick and dirty example: https://asciinema.org/a/641853
Feb 20 20:59:49 <korn3r>	mdogg: i dont think that one is available in my region, and i still cant wrap my head aroung "penetrating oil", but i suppose that is something not gross
Feb 20 21:00:24 <nullvalue>	superzilla, ok
Feb 20 21:00:31 <mdogg>	EFI determines which file to use for booting by searching the EFI System Partition (ESP) for the desired operating system's subdirectory and then looking for a bootloader file with a specific filename within that subdirectory.  So in Linux with grub, Linux systems using GRUB, the bootloader file is usually named `grubx64.efi`.
Feb 20 21:02:37 <FlorianBad>	mdogg, ok but right now e.g. I installed slackware which has elilo. And in the EFI partition (vfat) there's only /boot/efi/EFI/Slackware/ with elilo.efi + initrd.gz + vmlinuz  inside. So something else must know that it's there?  What is that "something else" ?
Feb 20 21:02:39 <neoncortex>	dont mind the typos, Im doing two other things at the same time xD
Feb 20 21:02:42 <bane_killgrind>	korn3r: you could say wicking oil if you are uncomfortable but nobody calls it that
Feb 20 21:02:48 <ib>	getting to like this os
Feb 20 21:03:31 <nullvalue>	ib: make sure it like you back, take it for dinner some time XD
Feb 20 21:03:45 <ib>	I just miht.
Feb 20 21:03:51 <ib>	might
Feb 20 21:03:59 <nullvalue>	cool
Feb 20 21:04:01 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 20 21:04:02 *	litharge sets ban on $a:sam113101$##fix_your_connection
Feb 20 21:04:10 <mdogg>	korn3r: Say you have a machined bolt that's seized (locked) because of decades of rust or because it was super-heated at some point.  A penetrating oil will (or is supposed to be able to) penetrate into the smallest voids and provide lubrication so that after 20-30 minutes you can remove it.
Feb 20 21:04:13 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 20 21:04:26 <ib>	replace windows completely
Feb 20 21:04:42 <nullvalue>	mdogg: id weld something to it and pry it out
Feb 20 21:05:03 <Khaytsus>	You say this all the time as if normies have welding machines
Feb 20 21:05:06 <nullvalue>	oh wait you didnt mention if it were broken
Feb 20 21:05:10 <korn3r>	mdogg: i got that from name actually, i just never heard that term (penetrating oil)
Feb 20 21:05:16 <Khaytsus>	Besides, nothing was said about the bolt being broken
Feb 20 21:05:23 <neoncortex>	normies dont have welding machines?
Feb 20 21:05:26 <nullvalue>	i keep forgetting that im not normal Khaytsus
Feb 20 21:05:28 <nullvalue>	sowwy
Feb 20 21:05:49 <mdogg>	FlorianBad: I have only seen EFI partitions formatted with FAT32,
Feb 20 21:06:16 <FlorianBad>	which is vfat, isn't it?
Feb 20 21:06:23 <mdogg>	No, vFAT is different.
Feb 20 21:07:02 <mdogg>	I'm not sure if that might be the cause of whatever issue you're having or not - just something I noticed when you said vFAT for your EFI.
Feb 20 21:07:09 <FlorianBad>	well, whatever, it works either way so that doens't change the rest I guess
Feb 20 21:07:28 <FlorianBad>	I don't have any issue, I'm just trying to understand how it works
Feb 20 21:07:59 <mdogg>	vFAT allows long filenames where FAT32 does not.
Feb 20 21:08:04 <mdogg>	Oh ok.
Feb 20 21:08:08 <mdogg>	Hmm..  Let me see..
Feb 20 21:10:19 <mdogg>	So for me, I have grubx64.efi in /boot/efi/EFI/opensuse/ and that's my only operating system.
Feb 20 21:10:54 <mdogg>	Woops, sorry - that's where it loads grub.
Feb 20 21:13:33 <mdogg>	FlorianBad: Do you have two operating systems listed in GRUB?
Feb 20 21:13:57 <jim>	does that mean ext4 is skinny?
Feb 20 21:14:09 <mdogg>	Err, I mean elilo.
Feb 20 21:14:32 <korn3r>	FlorianBad: https://www.happyassassin.net/posts/2014/01/25/uefi-boot-how-does-that-actually-work-then/
Feb 20 21:15:06 <korn3r>	couldnt find it faster, sorry. nice article. basically efi boot mgr writes link to itself into firmware
Feb 20 21:15:14 <mdogg>	korn3r: Good article bro
Feb 20 21:16:25 <korn3r>	"this device, this efi" is added to firmware (UEFI firmware has functionality to allow that)
Feb 20 21:17:07 <mdogg>	I wonder if Microsoft can come up with a way to make 'obese' a filesystem acronym.
Feb 20 21:17:27 <mdogg>	Maybe the new 'new technology'.
Feb 20 21:24:08 <FlorianBad>	mdogg, I don't use grub, I use elilo
Feb 20 21:24:25 <mdogg>	Yeah, I misspoke.
Feb 20 21:25:08 <FlorianBad>	(oh I was still reading the rest)
Feb 20 21:25:29 <korn3r>	FlorianBad: isnt it not developed for couple years already?
Feb 20 21:26:24 <FlorianBad>	korn3r, elilo? It's the default in Slackware and I want to keep it simple. So as long as it works I have no reason to change it
Feb 20 21:26:31 *	FlorianBad reading the article
Feb 20 21:26:46 <korn3r>	last elilo release 11 years ago...
Feb 20 21:27:08 <mdogg>	I've never used elilo but it's similar to grub from what I've been reading.  Although it seems like it is primarily used on systems with unique boot requirements like when there's a need to boot from a network share or a compressed file.  At least that's my take.
Feb 20 21:27:32 <mdogg>	Oh really?
Feb 20 21:27:58 <ssm_>	FlorianBad: simplest one I have used that supports both uefi and bios is syslinux/extlinux
Feb 20 21:30:07 <MrCaturayNight>	python
Feb 20 21:30:13 <MrCaturayNight>	oops
Feb 20 21:30:14 <FlorianBad>	ssm_, sometimes it's fine to keep using what we've always been using as long as it still works fine, because otherwise we just run out of time (I won't live forever and there's only 24h a day ;) )
Feb 20 21:31:02 <neoncortex>	I use whatever is the default, and in the slackware, it is e?lilo
Feb 20 21:31:32 <rlikon>	FlorianBad: that would be sad advise for ppl using m$$11
Feb 20 21:31:55 <bane_killgrind>	mdogg: ordered binary executable (and) storage edifice
Feb 20 21:32:44 <korn3r>	"GRUB2 debuting as default bootloader in 15.1" (c) Reddit about slackware half a year ago.
Feb 20 21:32:47 <bane_killgrind>	that last word had me looking up synonyms and it's still not great
Feb 20 21:32:55 <dostoyevsky2>	> apt-file find R # -> 500k results.... I guess I won't find the package that provides R that way
Feb 20 21:33:18 <korn3r>	^R& doesnt work?
Feb 20 21:33:40 <clotoan>	Wasted 2 hours researching madaidan "insecurity" and realized it's a basically FUD. He recommend using Windows, Mac OS and do NOT give any cite how is more secure, only attack linux. It's good to see madaidan "plague" ended.
Feb 20 21:33:46 <n4dir>	i didn't even know apt-file "find" exists
Feb 20 21:33:57 <rlikon>	dostoyevsky2: R got hundreds of packages, that's true.
Feb 20 21:34:28 <mdogg>	bane_killgrind: What did you order?
Feb 20 21:34:38 <n4dir>	damn it, i confused apt-file with apt-cache. my fault
Feb 20 21:34:42 <HumbleGuy>	i'm trying to open a script from keyboard shortcut but it doesnt work. The script is executable, in PATH and contains feh /dir/to/img. But when I assign it to my DE keyboard nothing happens, why is hat
Feb 20 21:35:12 <rlikon>	dostoyevsky2: there's gotta be a meta-package though
Feb 20 21:35:13 <bane_killgrind>	mdogg: OBE (and) SE
Feb 20 21:35:31 <neoncortex>	bane_killgrind: oh, interesting.  Seems my next install will be with grub.
Feb 20 21:35:32 <dostoyevsky2>	it's in r-base...
Feb 20 21:35:34 <n4dir>	could try "apt-file find bin/R "
Feb 20 21:35:41 <TuxJobs>	I have `MyCustomApplication*iconPixmap: /valid/path/to/a.xpm` in `~/.Xresources` and `xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources` has been run. When I open an XTerm with -class MyCustomApplication, it still gets the default XTerm icon in the top-left corner of the terminal's Plasma window. Other options such as `MyCustomApplication*faceName: Monospace` work, so it's not a case of the config not being read. The ".xpm" icon was created with `convert input.png a.xpm`. What is
Feb 20 21:35:41 <TuxJobs>	wrong?
Feb 20 21:35:47 <mdogg>	I think you're confusing me with a conversation you had with somebody else, bane_killgrind.
Feb 20 21:35:57 <dostoyevsky2>	n4dir: thta looks better
Feb 20 21:36:02 <ssm_>	clotoan: hey at least they give you easy access to their sh!tcoin wallet on their websites front page
Feb 20 21:36:03 <n4dir>	dostoyevsky2: slightly
Feb 20 21:36:39 <Blohsh>	hi there im looking for something to locally transfer my files from debian to android or android to debain like KDE Connect
Feb 20 21:36:46 <Blohsh>	any suggestion? KDE Connect is too slow
Feb 20 21:36:55 <ssm_>	scp
Feb 20 21:37:08 <ssm_>	scp will be slow too though. rsync?
Feb 20 21:37:17 <n4dir>	Blohsh: sshfs would work if a ssh server is installed on the android, but there are smarter ways
Feb 20 21:37:23 <Blohsh>	and works like its transferring from internet and receiving from internet i mean 121KiB/s it should be 100+ Mbps
Feb 20 21:37:43 <bane_killgrind>	mdogg nah you wanted obese to be a file name system acronym lol
Feb 20 21:37:44 <Blohsh>	locally laptop is connected via ethernet and phone connected to 5ghz wifi
Feb 20 21:37:46 <mdogg>	TuxJobs: I would suggest using the absolute path rather than ~/      That may not resolve the issue but it's where I would start if I had a problem like that
Feb 20 21:37:51 <bane_killgrind>	i'm just making stuff up
Feb 20 21:37:55 <neoncortex>	you can have a ssh client on the android and transfer from the client to the server.
Feb 20 21:38:01 <W_t>	Blohsh: use total commander for android, it has support for sftp
Feb 20 21:38:03 <Blohsh>	also phone is not rooted
Feb 20 21:38:12 <mdogg>	bane_killgrind: OHH Ok..  Sorry, I'm a bit slow at the moment with tmux going.
Feb 20 21:38:18 <clotoan>	Sorry from him I use chat gpt to summarize :)) and the wallet is 0.00$ with no transaction lmao
Feb 20 21:38:23 <korn3r>	dostoyevsky2: apt-file search --regexp bin/R$
Feb 20 21:38:26 <neoncortex>	(if the client on the android have the scp command, or an interface to it, that is)
Feb 20 21:38:27 <korn3r>	or who asked...
Feb 20 21:39:19 <korn3r>	ah... you found that. nvm then
Feb 20 21:40:23 <mdogg>	I agree with neoncortex.  You can ssh from your phone to your Linux box and then use scp to transfer files between either of them.  Or, you can use scp to transfer files between your phone and another box by running scp from a 3rd machine.
Feb 20 21:40:54 <FlorianBad>	korn3r, I hate whoever wrote that article... No one cares about your jokes and feelings, this thing could be 10x shorter... damned! But still thanks :) I'll keep reading
Feb 20 21:41:10 <mdogg>	Probably easier to do by running a ssh app on your phone, though.  That way you can get the exact directory names.
Feb 20 21:41:22 <ssm_>	I got ssh working inside termux or whatever it was called back before I switched to a proper linux phone. not rooted either.
Feb 20 21:41:51 <korn3r>	FlorianBad: shorter not always better. that was the first one i was able to understand without special knowledge
Feb 20 21:41:59 <mdogg>	I use ssh on my iPhone.
Feb 20 21:42:28 <velix>	mdogg: print "say hello" :-)
Feb 20 21:42:35 <velix>	mdogg: You can make siri say anything you want.
Feb 20 21:42:48 <korn3r>	there is an app for android called xplore. i think it had some sort of fileserver on it. but didnt use it for a long time
Feb 20 21:42:50 <velix>	"say" is a command on iPhone's shell.
Feb 20 21:42:51 <n4dir>	and i don't even know him
Feb 20 21:43:01 <FlorianBad>	korn3r, yeah but I'm refering to the "all right let's do this..." and "I feel like..." etc. lol Each sentence could deliver the same info with 10% the length
Feb 20 21:43:08 <ssm_>	mdogg: do you mean just using an ssh client to access other devices from your iphone? because I remember looking into this some months ago and there didn't seem to be a way to actually ssh into an iphone
Feb 20 21:43:10 <tusko>	which network manager is hotter in 2024 systemd-networkd or NetworkManager?
Feb 20 21:43:12 <mdogg>	I just can't access my Photos directory that way.  If there's a photo I want to access via ssh/scp I have to move it to my Saved Files (local on phone) or a directory in iCloud.
Feb 20 21:43:14 <neoncortex>	proper linux phone?
Feb 20 21:43:45 <ssm_>	neoncortex: pinephone/librem 5/fairphone/etc with os like postmarketOS/mobian
Feb 20 21:43:55 <ssm_>	good selection now
Feb 20 21:44:07 <Blohsh>	01:38 AM <W_t> Blohsh: use total commander for android, it has support for sftp
Feb 20 21:44:13 <Blohsh>	thats also working slow
Feb 20 21:44:18 <n4dir>	tusko: there is conman and stuff, or was, but i am not sure if it is hot
Feb 20 21:44:46 <Blohsh>	<n4dir> Blohsh: sshfs would work if a ssh server is installed on the android
Feb 20 21:44:48 <Blohsh>	not rooted
Feb 20 21:44:48 <n4dir>	someone mentioned wicd the other day, i thought it was gone
Feb 20 21:44:56 <tusko>	I think I was having an issue running systemd-networkd and NetwrkManager at the same time
Feb 20 21:45:04 <n4dir>	Blohsh: i didn't say anything about rooting
Feb 20 21:45:06 <neoncortex>	ssm_: I see.
Feb 20 21:45:08 <korn3r>	https://www.lonelycatgames.com/apps/xplore even wifi file sharing
Feb 20 21:45:26 <Blohsh>	doesn't ssh require root?
Feb 20 21:45:36 <tusko>	no
Feb 20 21:45:44 <n4dir>	Blohsh: what i have installed is sshdaemon
Feb 20 21:45:45 <neoncortex>	the client dont, that is why I mentioned it.  I think the server does.
Feb 20 21:45:49 <bane_killgrind>	FlorianBad: the article starts with "IMPORTANT NOTE TO INDUSTRY FOLKS: This blog post is aimed at regular everyday folks"
Feb 20 21:45:51 <ssm_>	neoncortex: fair warning, on the software side mobile linux is VERY jank still, expect the worst, and then some. calling has consistently worked fine in my experience, at the very least
Feb 20 21:46:02 <n4dir>	my phone sure isn't rooted.
Feb 20 21:46:13 <tusko>	root it. u won't.
Feb 20 21:46:24 <neoncortex>	ssm_: I would be interested in it to have a pocket linux computer on the fly, not exactly for its phone features.
Feb 20 21:46:27 <Blohsh>	n4dir, sshdaemon from where? playstore?
Feb 20 21:46:32 <n4dir>	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sshdaemon
Feb 20 21:46:33 <n4dir>	yup
Feb 20 21:46:49 <n4dir>	Blohsh: i won't bet it will work. Phones, to me , are voodoo
Feb 20 21:46:54 <FlorianBad>	bane_killgrind, lol. I'm not regular, just went to the bathroom
Feb 20 21:47:51 <n4dir>	i assumed and think i was told here you can access the smartphone with some protocol via the filemanager in linux?
Feb 20 21:47:59 <Blohsh>	n4dir, "this app isn't available for your device... made for an older version of Android"
Feb 20 21:48:08 <n4dir>	Blohsh: damn it, sorry
Feb 20 21:48:43 <W_t>	how about just using a USB-C cord and attach it to a computer under file-transfer/manager mode?
Feb 20 21:48:49 <ssm_>	does android break abi?
Feb 20 21:49:03 <ssm_>	I mean I guess it could just be api breakage too
Feb 20 21:49:15 <Blohsh>	n4dir, webdav i think?
Feb 20 21:49:26 <tusko>	ssm_: abi or api?
Feb 20 21:50:01 <W_t>	Blohsh: you can't just attach the phone via USB and copy files that way?
Feb 20 21:50:14 <ssm_>	tusko: I'm just wondering why an older application would stop working on a newer android is all
Feb 20 21:50:22 <n4dir>	Blohsh: might be libmtp https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-connect-your-android-device-on-linux/
Feb 20 21:50:31 <Blohsh>	W_t, transferring a single file and using cable again and again is annoying
Feb 20 21:50:40 <n4dir>	Blohsh: someone here told me, someone in #devuan told me step by step, and it sure worked, but i forgot all the details
Feb 20 21:50:56 <ssm_>	tusko: the fact it couldn't just be packaged in a runtime would make me think it's something like abi breakage
Feb 20 21:51:01 <n4dir>	well, you have to load the phone anyway
Feb 20 21:51:07 <tusko>	ssm_: maybe its referencing older libs
Feb 20 21:51:08 <bane_killgrind>	ssm_: api changes, like call recording is now not app accessible in stock android because law stuff
Feb 20 21:51:10 <TyrfingM1olnir>	How do I select a font in terminal?
Feb 20 21:51:29 <n4dir>	terminal-emulator?
Feb 20 21:51:32 <tusko>	ssm_: if something uses boost, for example, that seems to break a lot
Feb 20 21:51:35 <TyrfingM1olnir>	I just did: apt install fonts-3270
Feb 20 21:51:43 <neoncortex>	a law preventing me to record my own calls?
Feb 20 21:51:49 <bane_killgrind>	api might have had to restructure at some point to support newer functions, breaking old usage.
Feb 20 21:52:00 <TyrfingM1olnir>	neoncortex: You can always record what yourself is part of.
Feb 20 21:52:10 <n4dir>	neoncortex: we still allowed to do calls?
Feb 20 21:52:18 <ssm_>	my hacked pinephone modem firmware can record calls, don't tell the feds
Feb 20 21:52:22 <bane_killgrind>	neoncortex: yeah there are some states that require two party consent, if you don't get consent it's wiretapping or whatever BS
Feb 20 21:52:26 <neoncortex>	n4dir: I hope we still are.
Feb 20 21:52:34 <neoncortex>	bane_killgrind: I see.
Feb 20 21:52:35 <tusko>	depends on if you're in a one- or two-party consent state whether such a recording is 'legal' per se
Feb 20 21:52:42 <n4dir>	neoncortex: it is all very quick these days. Suddenly you are illegal
Feb 20 21:52:48 <neoncortex>	n4dir: yes xD
Feb 20 21:53:03 <TyrfingM1olnir>	neoncortex: Whether it's legal in court on the other hand ...
Feb 20 21:53:10 <neoncortex>	it just looks like it is all bullshit, I wonder.
Feb 20 21:53:17 <bane_killgrind>	in normal places like canada you can record your own calls all day, but of course the api isn't regional so I don't get call recording anymore
Feb 20 21:53:19 <uwharrie>	TyrfingM1olnir: depends on the terminal
Feb 20 21:53:46 <TyrfingM1olnir>	uwharrie: The terminal of what?
Feb 20 21:53:55 <TyrfingM1olnir>	For this MacBook the terminal is iTerm
Feb 20 21:54:08 <n4dir>	probably the one you use. But you might also get the answer for the one i use.
Feb 20 21:54:25 <TyrfingM1olnir>	uwharrie: On my x240 I run alacritty
Feb 20 21:54:57 <uwharrie>	different terminals have different ways to set their font. you'll need to find another channel for help with macOS apps
Feb 20 21:55:17 <n4dir>	most of the time it is called "preferences"
Feb 20 21:55:37 <TyrfingM1olnir>	On my other MacBook I ride bareback
Feb 20 21:55:40 <rocks>	Profiles for iTerm2
Feb 20 21:55:48 <TyrfingM1olnir>	Arch with no wm
Feb 20 21:55:49 <mdogg>	ssm_: This option in 'FTP On-The-Go Pro' will host an FTP server on my phone.  I don't do it very often because it's more secure to use the phone to ssh to a remote device than the other way around..  https://www.mdogg.com/mdogg/temp/ftp-server.png
Feb 20 21:56:19 <ssm_>	mdogg.com seems like an expensive domain
Feb 20 21:56:24 <bane_killgrind>	ssm_: I have a burner android getting shipped right now, I might use it for my daily driver and hotspot, and keep my pixel for email/chats etc
Feb 20 21:56:48 <rocks>	Keeping the Feds off your tail eh
Feb 20 21:56:58 <W_t>	unencrypted ftp is not ideal, unless you trust all parts of the network you're using
Feb 20 21:57:14 <bane_killgrind>	The mounties don't care rocks
Feb 20 21:57:52 <TyrfingM1olnir>	So, I'm at no window manager, yet tmux, and alacritty
Feb 20 21:58:09 <n4dir>	amazing.
Feb 20 21:58:15 <mdogg>	It was super expensive when GoDaddy was the registrar but I moved everything to Cloudflare a few years ago.  They will registrar domains for anyone at cost.
Feb 20 21:58:43 <rocks>	GoDaddy are also the most terrible registrar in existence, so not giving them money is a bonus
Feb 20 21:58:50 <mdogg>	^
Feb 20 21:58:58 <mdogg>	They really are crap.
Feb 20 21:59:00 <TuxJobs>	CloudFlare is Satan.
Feb 20 21:59:11 <TyrfingM1olnir>	I believe ssh has been invented, why use ftp when there is rsync?
Feb 20 21:59:14 <Armand>	I still have my sole domain with a subsidiary of GD.
Feb 20 21:59:21 <Armand>	I'm happy to leave it there, for now.
Feb 20 21:59:31 <hodapp>	I stand by my theory that Cloudflare is responsible for launching the same DDoSes they claim to protect against.
Feb 20 21:59:31 <Armand>	TuxJobs +1
Feb 20 21:59:34 <TuxJobs>	mdogg: What do you mean by that? "I would suggest using the absolute path rather than ~/"? I use the absolute path for the icon inside the file.
Feb 20 21:59:35 <TyrfingM1olnir>	There is also something called git, it's way better than ftp from what I gather
Feb 20 21:59:41 <TuxJobs>	Just like I showed.
Feb 20 21:59:44 <Armand>	I will never trust Clodflare with anything.
Feb 20 21:59:48 <mdogg>	I love Cloudflare.  I know some people despise them but whatever.  It's not a debate worth having.
Feb 20 21:59:51 <Armand>	Same with OVH.
Feb 20 22:00:02 <hodapp>	Armand: what's wrong with OVH?
Feb 20 22:00:11 <neoncortex>	you dont use a wm?  Like you open the graphical server with an termnial and thats that?
Feb 20 22:00:18 <ssm_>	TyrfingM1olnir: x without a window manager is fun, though I stopped doing it because a lot of graphical applications expect a window manager and break in weird ways (usually window size) when you don't have one. If you want a recommendation for a very basic window manager that's effectively as good as not having one, look at tinywm
Feb 20 22:00:19 <neoncortex>	s/an/a
Feb 20 22:00:20 <TyrfingM1olnir>	hodapp: I bet black lotus can help you out with those DDoses
Feb 20 22:00:24 <EdFletcher>	mdogg: seconded. all of their services have exceptional ease-of-use, and they're cheap. i'm loving Workers.
Feb 20 22:01:21 <TyrfingM1olnir>	ssm_: I have an i3wm config, that will start if I type startx; however mostly I'm in tmux / neovim anyway, no need to slow down the experience on days I do not need to.
Feb 20 22:01:36 <Armand>	hodapp: Obviously Very Hacked.. They do not care in the slightest what they host, or what kind of security flaws they have.
Feb 20 22:01:38 <mdogg>	ssm_: I'm logged in to Cloudflare so I could look up what they're charging me - mdogg.com @ is $9.77USD/year.
Feb 20 22:01:50 <ssm_>	not bad
Feb 20 22:02:19 <W_t>	$8-9/y for .com is pretty normal I think
Feb 20 22:02:31 <tusko>	that's cheap
Feb 20 22:02:35 <W_t>	so your pice seems normal
Feb 20 22:02:40 <W_t>	price*
Feb 20 22:02:40 <TyrfingM1olnir>	neoncortex: For many tasks git, scp, rsync, tmux, neovim is what I need.
Feb 20 22:02:45 <n4dir>	i would take 2 for that price
Feb 20 22:02:49 <ssm_>	TyrfingM1olnir: call me pedantic, but I doubt i3wm is going to meaningfully "slow down" anything as you put it
Feb 20 22:02:49 <mdogg>	I was paying loads more at Godaddy.  I was getting bent over and didn't even realize it.
Feb 20 22:03:11 <ssm_>	even on ancient hardware
Feb 20 22:03:23 <TyrfingM1olnir>	ssm_: It works fine without, I only launch X to use firefox aurora or chromium
Feb 20 22:03:31 <mdogg>	And GoDaddy has almost no useful tools/resources to help manage the domain.
Feb 20 22:03:35 <ssm_>	what will slow things down is stopping and restarting an X server over and over :P
Feb 20 22:03:41 <bane_killgrind>	Canhost charges me $15.55 for my .ca which would be 11.50USD
Feb 20 22:03:42 <TyrfingM1olnir>	ssm_: Most my MacBooks are 2015
Feb 20 22:04:01 <TyrfingM1olnir>	ssm_: Every saturday?
Feb 20 22:04:07 <neoncortex>	TyrfingM1olnir: I see.  I prefer to use bash directly, but I understand.
Feb 20 22:05:12 <TyrfingM1olnir>	neoncortex: How would bash support your clipboard? I use tmux for clipboard
Feb 20 22:06:21 <neoncortex>	TyrfingM1olnir: scripts, but yes, most of the time I use tmux clipboard.
Feb 20 22:06:57 <neoncortex>	also, my setup is tmux, ed, xclip, fzf, etc...
Feb 20 22:07:22 <tusko>	ed is best editor
Feb 20 22:07:23 <mdogg>	bane_killgrind: I selected the option to add 'killgrind.ca' to my account and I have a choice of plans - the least expensive one is free.
Feb 20 22:07:34 <mdogg>	I don't know what your domain is so I just used that to check.
Feb 20 22:07:34 <Armand>	tusko: Nano or nothing!
Feb 20 22:07:39 <ssm_>	tty may support its own clipboard, openbsd has something called wsmoused which allows you to select and copy text with a mouse cursor inside the tty. don't know if there's anything like that on linux
Feb 20 22:07:45 <bane_killgrind>	hey that's mine!
Feb 20 22:07:52 *	tusko feels illness
Feb 20 22:08:02 <ssm_>	actually probably wsmoused has the clipboard, not the tty
Feb 20 22:08:21 <NeXeN>	ugh, i wish google could just give some sort of ballpark estimates of vertex costs
Feb 20 22:08:33 <bane_killgrind>	https://www.whois.com/whois/killgrind.ca I should see if canhost will unredact some of this info
Feb 20 22:08:34 <n4dir>	truth to be told, i am not too sure what a clipboard is.
Feb 20 22:08:34 <uwharrie>	gpm is the Linux equivalent of wsmoused
Feb 20 22:09:11 <mdogg>	bane_killgrind: Sorry - nevermind my last.  That was to move that existing domain to Cloudflare (assuming I already own it) so obviously that would be free.. heh
Feb 20 22:10:03 <bane_killgrind>	if you managed to take it that would be interesting, I manage it with afraid.org
Feb 20 22:10:21 <bane_killgrind>	like I would have had to have made some mistake
Feb 20 22:10:45 <TyrfingM1olnir>	tusko: My Amiga had ed
Feb 20 22:11:03 <Khaytsus>	Also had microemacs, which I still use to this day.
Feb 20 22:11:03 <TyrfingM1olnir>	Armand: Nano? You must be a Windows user.
Feb 20 22:11:05 <mdogg>	killgrind.com is $9.77USD / killgrind.uk is $4.94USD / killgrind.cafe is the most expensive per year @ $28.18USD.
Feb 20 22:11:08 *	ssm_ gives TyrfingM1olnir's Amiga some viagra
Feb 20 22:11:34 *	TyrfingM1olnir is afraid this caused Bram's death
Feb 20 22:11:37 <mdogg>	Khaytsus: Doesn't that go by a different name?
Feb 20 22:11:43 <Khaytsus>	mdogg: "Advanced Editor"
Feb 20 22:11:44 <mdogg>	Maybe I'm thinking of something else.
Feb 20 22:12:07 <neoncortex>	I dont use ed directly because that ed shell is horrible.  It can be mitigated with readline, but it is still horrible.  I use bash to interface it.
Feb 20 22:12:28 <Khaytsus>	mdogg: On the amiga, the "Advanced Editor" was microemacs version 3.12.
Feb 20 22:12:45 <TyrfingM1olnir>	Many people moved to zsh, I do not see the fascination; I have used BASh since forever.
Feb 20 22:13:20 <rocks>	Not cool unless you use fish now
Feb 20 22:13:30 <mdogg>	Oh - Jasspa
Feb 20 22:13:41 <n4dir>	isn't dash the newest thing?
Feb 20 22:13:42 <neoncortex>	Im not scripting fish, thanks.
Feb 20 22:13:48 <ssm_>	TyrfingM1olnir: "who cares about posix compliance when you can have fancy colors" -zsh user probably
Feb 20 22:14:02 <Khaytsus>	mdogg: No idea what it's called today but that sounds right..  there's also zile that behaves very similar to microemacs 3.12
Feb 20 22:14:15 <tusko>	Khaytsus: I, too, use emacs. see how much we have in common?
Feb 20 22:14:31 <Khaytsus>	tusko: except not really
Feb 20 22:14:35 <n4dir>	perhaps it was mksh
Feb 20 22:14:38 <bane_killgrind>	.sucks is a valid TLD hmmm
Feb 20 22:14:41 <neoncortex>	after Im done here, emacs will be obsolete.
Feb 20 22:14:46 *	neoncortex start the flame
Feb 20 22:14:50 <ssm_>	mg is openbsd's (M)icro (G)nu emacs, and somehow it made its way onto macos
Feb 20 22:15:10 <kfrench>	One time, I started vi inside of tmux.  It will live forever!
Feb 20 22:15:13 <bane_killgrind>	neon I have never before witnessed such hubris
Feb 20 22:15:17 <Khaytsus>	I still insist on ^s being search, newer microemacs changed it to something else.
Feb 20 22:15:20 <mdogg>	I'm installing zile to check it out.
Feb 20 22:15:23 <neoncortex>	bane_killgrind: lel
Feb 20 22:16:23 <ssm_>	uemacs and mg are for psychos like me who actually think emacs is a good editor
Feb 20 22:16:36 <ssm_>	my fingers are doomed
Feb 20 22:17:20 <neoncortex>	line editors are easily scriptable with the shell, thats the way I going in.
Feb 20 22:18:18 <hodapp>	mg is handy to have around
Feb 20 22:18:27 <mdogg>	After opening Zile, one of the very first lines says"GNU Zile comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY."    That is unacceptable!
Feb 20 22:18:33 <mdogg>	Just kidding.
Feb 20 22:18:47 <nullvalue>	now i gotta learn zile
Feb 20 22:18:58 <mdogg>	I'll probably be easier than vim.
Feb 20 22:19:39 <nullvalue>	I'll just nano the carp outta stuff
Feb 20 22:19:56 <mdogg>	And the pike.
Feb 20 22:20:22 <mdogg>	Those are two ornery fish.
Feb 20 22:21:04 <ssm_>	hodapp: my least favorite thing about mg is that it creates backup files by default, so you end up with a bunch of files with ~ appended to the name all over the place. I'm half tempted to go onto the lists with a patch to remove this behavior
Feb 20 22:21:22 <ssm_>	I don't know if that's something that was copied from emacs or not
Feb 20 22:21:51 <circuitbone>	yeah but what editor did your write your editor in
Feb 20 22:21:57 <neoncortex>	yes, emacs does that also.
Feb 20 22:22:05 <neoncortex>	circuitbone: vim.
Feb 20 22:22:26 <circuitbone>	ergo superior editor
Feb 20 22:22:43 <neoncortex>	you cant create a scredriver with a screwdriver.
Feb 20 22:22:44 <mdogg>	Nobody uses kate?
Feb 20 22:23:01 <ssm_>	gooey? in my pc?
Feb 20 22:23:05 <x86>	neoncortex: yes you can.... maybe not the first ever screwdriver though
Feb 20 22:23:10 <mdogg>	No, the CLI version of kate.
Feb 20 22:23:12 <circuitbone>	I tried kate and spacemacs etc. I keep kate around and dumped sm
Feb 20 22:23:15 <neoncortex>	x86: how?
Feb 20 22:23:16 <hodapp>	you can create a hammer with a hammer, though.
Feb 20 22:23:26 <circuitbone>	screwdrivers lol
Feb 20 22:23:50 <mdogg>	I think torx/star screw heads/drivers are superior.
Feb 20 22:24:30 <nullvalue>	kate dumped me too, *sad*
Feb 20 22:24:51 <mdogg>	Yeah she's fickle, but hot.
Feb 20 22:25:17 <nullvalue>	hodapp: every time you say hammer someones terminal beeps
Feb 20 22:25:17 <ssm_>	https://0x0.st/H5-z.png kind of speaks for itself I think
Feb 20 22:25:47 <nullvalue>	not licking 0x0.st
Feb 20 22:25:58 <neoncortex>	yeah, also it push that telemetry thing now.
Feb 20 22:26:19 <ssm_>	nullvalue: there's something inherently funny about nullvalue complaining about 0x0
Feb 20 22:26:36 <x86>	neoncortex: the first one can be used to make the second
Feb 20 22:26:38 <neoncortex>	there it is, kuserfeedback.
Feb 20 22:26:57 <neoncortex>	x86: yeah, but you need more tools.
Feb 20 22:27:09 <x86>	neoncortex: maybe, sure
Feb 20 22:27:53 <x86>	neoncortex: but to say you can't create a screwdriver with a screwdriver might be a misnomer, as you potentially could use a screwdriver in the crafting process of another
Feb 20 22:28:31 <mdogg>	Sure, as a template.  Like they do with coins.
Feb 20 22:28:56 <jkli>	Hi all, I want to setup up certbot and let it refresh the certs automatically, but how do I do that if I bound it to an internal wireguard IP?
Feb 20 22:29:40 <neoncortex>	x86: thats right, maybe I should have specified you cant create a scredriver with a screwdriver alone.
Feb 20 22:30:19 <x86>	neoncortex: that's much more palatable :)
Feb 20 22:30:31 <neoncortex>	heh
Feb 20 22:30:57 <circuitbone>	I will never attempt to use a screwdriver to make an editor. til
Feb 20 22:31:13 <x86>	not a screwdriver alone, anyway haha
Feb 20 22:31:25 <neoncortex>	going out for some hours, later.
Feb 20 22:31:49 <circuitbone>	He is getting us some more screwdrivers. nice man
Feb 20 22:32:03 <ssm_>	first editors probably were in some approximation to ed, if not a bit simpler I imagine. It's not really like you can design something much simpler than "read stdin to file"
Feb 20 22:32:26 <korn3r>	jkli: nat?
Feb 20 22:33:30 <x86>	jkli: you will need to have wireguard PAT port 443 (or whatever port you're running your SSL service on) to the internal server
Feb 20 22:33:47 <jeffreymichael>	why ont??
Feb 20 22:33:52 <CrtxReavr>	ed was intended for paper terminals.
Feb 20 22:33:59 <mdogg>	jkli:  You should pose your question on Let's Encrypt support portal here --> https://community.letsencrypt.org/
Feb 20 22:34:00 <jeffreymichael>	ok
Feb 20 22:34:02 <jeffreymichael>	why not/?
Feb 20 22:34:11 <jkli>	yes
Feb 20 22:34:14 <jeffreymichael>	ok
Feb 20 22:34:17 <jeffreymichael>	'go ahead
Feb 20 22:35:05 <jeffreymichael>	damn...you look crazy dong4
Feb 20 22:35:06 <mdogg>	jkli: In fact, I did a quick search and there seem to be several articles including the terms 'wiregaurd' and 'certbot', so that would be the best resources for you.
Feb 20 22:35:41 <mdogg>	Oh, looks like x86 has some experience, too.
Feb 20 22:35:57 <jeffreymichael>	cou;ld be
Feb 20 22:37:44 <jeffreymichael>	peashee it in dawg
Feb 20 22:38:04 <mdogg>	jeffreymichael: It's annoying when people type a couple of words and then press [return].
Feb 20 22:38:05 <jkli>	x86 not sure how that helps me with ssl, the point is when I serve certbot it requires either a file server or a dns challenge, but when the file server is bound to an internal network interface, it won't be accessable from the web
Feb 20 22:38:45 <jkli>	i think i found a way to do that, need to do some tricks with nginx
Feb 20 22:38:50 <s1gyn>	mdogg: I suspect they are just making random noise.
Feb 20 22:38:55 <kfrench>	jkli: Can you put that cert on a temporary machine that is exposed to the internet?
Feb 20 22:38:57 <x86>	jkli: hence the need for external accessibility... the part where you said "I'm not sure about..." is the blank I'm trying to fill in for you
Feb 20 22:39:06 <jeffreymichael>	im not much of a talker
Feb 20 22:39:11 <mrcoffee>	Hi there
Feb 20 22:39:17 <jeffreymichael>	hi
Feb 20 22:39:20 <luna>	hey
Feb 20 22:39:27 <mdogg>	jeffreymichael: You're more than welcome to stay in here and read, then.
Feb 20 22:39:29 <mrcoffee>	My laptop wont shut down, its a legion 5 with dual boot..
Feb 20 22:39:34 <mdogg>	Otherwise, please form complete sentences.
Feb 20 22:39:40 <mrcoffee>	I edited grub but it dident solve the issue..
Feb 20 22:39:50 <mdogg>	"I'm not much of a talker." is an example of a complete sentence.
Feb 20 22:39:59 <x86>	mdogg: lmao
Feb 20 22:40:00 <mrcoffee>	If i run dpkg on boot, it will shutdown once, but then on the next cycle the issue will be bac,..
Feb 20 22:40:17 <mrcoffee>	It basically says its shutting down, powering off, but it never does..
Feb 20 22:40:31 <mrcoffee>	It also says remounting filesystem on read only mode -ro
Feb 20 22:41:20 <mrcoffee>	Thats the line i changed in grub which apparently should have fixed the issue:
Feb 20 22:41:23 <x86>	almost sounds like ACPI is disabled somehow
Feb 20 22:41:44 <mrcoffee>	It does says something about acpi but on shutdown too..
Feb 20 22:41:48 <mrcoffee>	acpi bug
Feb 20 22:41:50 <jeffreymichael>	no its not
Feb 20 22:41:59 <x86>	do you have "noacpi" on the kernel command line in your grub config?
Feb 20 22:42:02 <mrcoffee>	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi=force apm=power_off"
Feb 20 22:42:05 <x86>	 /ignore jeffreymichael
Feb 20 22:42:09 <x86>	oops, typo
Feb 20 22:42:19 <nullvalue>	XD
Feb 20 22:42:25 <mdogg>	mrcoffee: When it shuts down does it just sit with the last line reading, "Reached target shutdown" and never powers-off?
Feb 20 22:42:42 <jeffreymichael>	well..plug it in
Feb 20 22:42:51 <mrcoffee>	The last line i can read says powering off..
Feb 20 22:43:15 <mdogg>	mrcoffee: Try this to power off the system going forward:  'sudo shutdown -P now'
Feb 20 22:43:22 <Disconsented>	I'll presume that's a joke but for other folks watching, please don't declare /ignore's they're just antagonistic
Feb 20 22:43:58 <mrcoffee>	Also on shut down i get som acpi bug something on the lines of that: acpi bug tz.etmd
Feb 20 22:44:16 <mrcoffee>	Cool, mdogg but id like to be able to use the normal shut down from ubuntu or linux..
Feb 20 22:44:23 <mdogg>	(large P)  I have an issue with two of my boxes where if I just run 'poweroff' it goes through the shutdown routine and then sits at a screen that reads, "Reached Target Shutdown" and it will sit there forever until I press the power button.  So I got into the habit of using 'sudo shutdown -r now' when I want to reboot and 'sudo shutdown -P now' when I want to power-off.
Feb 20 22:44:56 <mrcoffee>	x86 i dont have noacpi on the grub config..
Feb 20 22:45:07 <mrcoffee>	How could I have disabled acpi by accident?
Feb 20 22:45:11 <mdogg>	mrcoffee: Try that shutdown command first to see if it will actually power-off your box.  If it does then maybe you can create a shortcut that you can click which runs a script with that command.
Feb 20 22:45:26 <mrcoffee>	OK, ill try the command now, be back in 5
Feb 20 22:45:29 <HumbleGuy>	#bash
Feb 20 22:45:57 <mdogg>	It'll work.
Feb 20 22:49:03 <jeffreymichael>	its here man dogg
Feb 20 22:49:16 <jeffreymichael>	ok
Feb 20 22:51:29 <kfrench>	I think it's pronounced Dr Ogg.
Feb 20 22:53:07 <mdogg>	The .ogg format is free, open, and unrestricted by patents which makes it a popular choice for open-source projects and digital content distribution.
Feb 20 22:54:17 <jeffreymichael>	well..burn it in then dawg
Feb 20 22:54:31 <jeffreymichael>	dogg
Feb 20 22:54:42 <mdogg>	Hey - oggPCM is a lossless audio format.  I didn't know that
Feb 20 22:54:58 <jeffreymichael>	dont burn it in to your dogs head then
Feb 20 22:55:07 <jeffreymichael>	than
Feb 20 22:57:08 <koollman>	mdogg: oggpcm isn't useful in many situations. flac is more typical when dealing with lossless audio
Feb 20 22:57:38 <mdogg>	Yea, I kind of figured.  I've never even /heard/ of oggPCM until I just read about it.
Feb 20 22:57:39 <koollman>	(oggpcm is nice when you want to transmit data to something that can't decompress/process much stuff)
Feb 20 22:58:04 <julie_pilgrim>	and here i was thinking oggPCM was some cool ogg cli tool i didn't know of
Feb 20 22:58:23 <koollman>	no, it's pretty much what the name say. it is pcm in ogg container :)
Feb 20 22:58:34 <jeffreymichael>	it is lady...just check it out
Feb 20 22:58:50 <bparker>	.ogg is not a format, it is a container that accepts several different codecs
Feb 20 22:58:56 <bparker>	both audio and video
Feb 20 22:59:13 <koollman>	bparker: well since you want to be pedant, it is a format. not an audio format ;)
Feb 20 22:59:38 <bparker>	container format.
Feb 20 22:59:38 <koollman>	(but, yes, the general .ogg term typically refer to ogg vorbis)
Feb 20 22:59:58 <bparker>	you could put vorbis, theora, opus, flac, dirac, speex or probably more in it
Feb 20 23:00:19 <mdogg>	.ra?  just kidding.
Feb 20 23:00:25 *	rascul closes the container
Feb 20 23:00:33 <bparker>	and I specifically know of some devices (android) that will work with e.g. opus but only if the extension is .ogg and not .opus
Feb 20 23:00:38 <bparker>	not sure why
Feb 20 23:00:54 <koollman>	easy: bad code :)
Feb 20 23:01:28 <mdogg>	Yeah, that's weird.  Opus is open-source as well.
Feb 20 23:01:36 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 20 23:01:37 *	litharge removes ban on *!*@2a02:3030:410:57b2:1:0:f8a4:628
Feb 20 23:01:37 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 20 23:03:24 <ssm_>	.opus is just an alias for .ogg
Feb 20 23:03:44 <ssm_>	unless that changed at some point
Feb 20 23:04:38 *	CrtxReavr is listeningto someone "mansplain" how fibre channel works. . . very poorly.
Feb 20 23:05:12 *	ssm_ tuxsplains to the windoid user why they should use lunix
Feb 20 23:06:41 <ssm_>	whenever I hear mansplained I just think of the stupid alpine linux copypasta
Feb 20 23:07:26 <hodapp>	what
Feb 20 23:07:40 <Armand>	wut
Feb 20 23:08:40 <mrcoffee>	HI x86 maddog
Feb 20 23:08:40 <ssm_>	"I use Linux as my operating system," I state proudly to the unkempt, bearded man. He swivels around in his desk chair with a devilish gleam in his eyes, ready to mansplain with extreme precision. "Actually", he says with a grin, "Linux is just the kernel. You use GNU+Linux!' I don't miss a beat and reply with a smirk, "I use Alpine, a distro that doesn't include the GNU Coreutils, or any other GNU code. It's Linux, but it's not GNU+Linux." The smile
Feb 20 23:08:40 <ssm_>	quickly drops from the man's face. His body begins convulsing and he foams at the mouth and drops to the floor with a sickly thud. As he writhes around he screams "I-IT WAS COMPILED WITH GCC! THAT MEANS IT'S STILL GNU!" Coolly, I reply "If windows were compiled with GCC, would that make it GNU?" I interrupt his response with "-and work is being made on the kernel to make it more compiler-agnostic. Even if you were correct, you won't be for long." With
Feb 20 23:08:41 <ssm_>	a sickly wheeze, the last of the man's life is ejected from his body. He lies on the floor, cold and limp. I've womansplained him to death.
Feb 20 23:08:43 <mrcoffee>	Same thing happening
Feb 20 23:08:49 <mrcoffee>	mdogg x86 everyone
Feb 20 23:09:14 <mrcoffee>	The command you provided wont shutdown the computer, i took an image
Feb 20 23:09:23 <Khaytsus>	ssm_: Um, less of that
Feb 20 23:09:40 <ssm_>	sorry, should have put it in a pastebin
Feb 20 23:09:41 <rascul>	can build kernel with clang
Feb 20 23:11:07 <mrcoffee>	Trying to upload the image somwhere to share
Feb 20 23:12:26 <mrcoffee>	Any good service for image sharing? Can I upload here in weechat somehow?
Feb 20 23:12:40 <ssm_>	mrcoffee: I use https://0x0.st usually
Feb 20 23:12:50 <hodapp>	0x0.st is handy
Feb 20 23:13:00 <W_t>	it is really good yes
Feb 20 23:13:03 <ssm_>	upload with `curl -F file=@filename https://0x0.st`
Feb 20 23:13:25 <nullie>	Is there a simple android client for 0x0.st or similar? maybe self hosted?
Feb 20 23:13:44 <nullie>	I need just simple upload photo - get a link
Feb 20 23:14:54 <mrcoffee>	Ok, thats what i see on shutdown: https://0x0.st/H5-f.jpg
Feb 20 23:15:43 <ssm_>	that big nasty acpi error seems relevant. try a different kernel version maybe? what distro is this
Feb 20 23:16:07 <kfrench>	Seems like one should look to see if there's bios updates for the hardware.
Feb 20 23:19:06 <mrcoffee>	Any suggestions x86 mdogg ?
Feb 20 23:23:27 <xx>	sigh, I wrote a todo.txt file in one directory, which contained a single line like "Remember to ask about ..." because I knew I'd forget
Feb 20 23:23:32 <xx>	I accidentally removed this file...
Feb 20 23:23:46 <xx>	probably no way of getting it back on btrfs, wonderful
Feb 20 23:23:55 <xx>	and it was within the hour so no backup happened
Feb 20 23:24:07 <hodapp>	boooo
Feb 20 23:24:23 <xx>	I really wish I remembered what I was supposed to ask about...
Feb 20 23:24:52 <xx>	can someone recommend a human memory recall exercise that worked for you?
Feb 20 23:25:04 <rocks>	MS OneNote
Feb 20 23:25:35 <Khaytsus>	xx: Usually for me; sleep.  I wake up at 3am realizing what I meant to remember the day before
Feb 20 23:25:47 <jeffreymichael>	a-z rolodex
Feb 20 23:25:52 <hodapp>	for one-off items? I write them down, by hand, then I don't need the written material because I remember it
Feb 20 23:26:01 <xx>	yeah I guess I'll remember eventually, hopefully, especially after sleep, but I'd rather not wait
Feb 20 23:26:38 <mrcoffee>	Maybe the issue is related to dual boot?
Feb 20 23:26:41 <Khaytsus>	xx: I sometimes solve puzzles or even code issues in my sleep.  I wake up with the answer.
Feb 20 23:27:10 <jeffreymichael>	thank GOD for sleep!!!
Feb 20 23:27:14 <W_t>	Khaytsus: and in the shower but you're right there
Feb 20 23:27:25 <W_t>	or on a stroll etc
Feb 20 23:27:32 <xx>	maybe I should take a walk and shower
Feb 20 23:27:43 <W_t>	it works pretty often
Feb 20 23:28:08 <Khaytsus>	W_t: I have a nest mini in my bathroom for music and taking notes..  it once moved where the notes get stored and I was quite annoyed I couldn't find what I'd brain-dumped into it.
Feb 20 23:28:37 <W_t>	hah understandable
Feb 20 23:32:53 <s1gyn>	xx writing things down helps a lot for me. Many of the notes I took in classes I never looked at again.
Feb 20 23:33:36 <phogg>	s1gyn: I am the same way
Feb 20 23:34:09 <s1gyn>	Like on paper, typing things doesn't help as much as writing.
Feb 20 23:34:19 <Khaytsus>	Same; rewriting my notes committed them to memory and rarely looked at the notes again after, maybe if a test covered material from earlier in a class.
Feb 20 23:34:22 <phogg>	that's not like me, then
Feb 20 23:34:32 <Khaytsus>	and yeah, I had to write it.. and I hate writing.
Feb 20 23:34:45 <NeXeN>	ever used joplin for notes? I like that I can sync across dropbox with my phone or laptop
Feb 20 23:34:46 <felco>	it was good while it lasted.. hexchat is becoming unmaintained :(
Feb 20 23:34:50 <phogg>	I don't get anything different from hand writing other than wasted time and frustration
Feb 20 23:34:57 <Khaytsus>	These days I just have lots of stray notes in Sublime ;)
Feb 20 23:35:05 <Khaytsus>	felco: To be continued..
Feb 20 23:35:10 <felco>	YAY!
Feb 20 23:35:19 <rocks>	Good job irssi is the best IRC client
Feb 20 23:35:20 <NeXeN>	my only problem is when i make todo lists it creates a psychological barrier to actually doing them so I quit that bad habbit
Feb 20 23:35:27 <Khaytsus>	felco: Someone will take it over, or fork it or...
Feb 20 23:35:31 <Khaytsus>	rocks: Spelled weechat wrong
Feb 20 23:35:33 <NeXeN>	I just use it to keep track of random howotos, guides, tutorials, primers, etc
Feb 20 23:36:10 <xx>	s1gyn: well yeah, I wrote it down, but in a file that I then deleted
Feb 20 23:36:17 <xx>	I'll need to start writing it using pen & paper
Feb 20 23:36:28 <NeXeN>	felco: what exactly does an irc client need to stay current? I mean it's like 40 year old technology
Feb 20 23:36:37 <xx>	uh, can someone recommend a resource on how to learn to write using pen & paper as an adult? I kinda forgot
Feb 20 23:36:49 <NeXeN>	i know there's IRCv3 and ircds add stuff from time to time, but ....like really?
Feb 20 23:36:55 <Khaytsus>	NeXeN: IRC is constantly evolving.
Feb 20 23:37:08 <Khaytsus>	Plus bug fixes, new libraries, etc.
Feb 20 23:37:15 *	NeXeN shrugs
Feb 20 23:37:23 <Disconsented>	I'd be very concerned with that xx and would be seeking out a referral from your GP
Feb 20 23:37:32 <felco>	NeXeN well.. that is true! but we got a new spec for the irc protocol, and some changes might still come.. also, hexchat is graphical irc client so things change more often
Feb 20 23:37:44 <xx>	Disconsented: I already did, I had a brain issue couple months back, this is related and being watched
Feb 20 23:37:59 <NeXeN>	anyways, if it's not being maintained then get the source, post it on github, and start pushing
Feb 20 23:38:12 <Disconsented>	Sweet as, I suspect they'll be able to give you better direction than #linux
Feb 20 23:38:32 <felco>	hexchat was forked from xchat, the guy did a great job so far!
Feb 20 23:38:46 <NeXeN>	contact him and ask to be added as a maintainer
Feb 20 23:38:54 <NeXeN>	he might be busy and welcome the extra help

Feb 20 23:42:41 <felco>	haha
Feb 20 23:43:23 <jeffreymichael>	l
Feb 20 23:43:45 <Inline>	L
Feb 20 23:44:26 <rascul>	you don't have to rewrite it in rust if you just write it in rust to begin with
Feb 20 23:45:06 <phogg>	rascul: that's a real "have a horse where you're going" type of solution
Feb 20 23:45:27 <NeXeN>	I'll make sure to pack a horse next time
Feb 20 23:45:35 <Khaytsus>	rascul: Is there an Atwoods Law, but for Rust?
Feb 20 23:45:46 <rascul>	i'm not a lawyer
Feb 20 23:46:04 <NeXeN>	felco: there's other things that can be done besides programming. Sometimes there are good c++ developers with patches waiting to get merged....or there may be people with free time who can code who need something to do....you can advocate and go find those people
Feb 20 23:47:38 <NeXeN>	then again it might circle back to my argument that there really aren't many things that can be done to a 40 year old protocol
Feb 20 23:48:35 <NeXeN>	I love circular logic.....i always win

Feb 21 00:09:32 <bane_killgrind>	xx did you try something like this https://github.com/danthem/undelete-btrfs
Feb 21 00:10:12 <xx>	I did not
Feb 21 00:10:47 <ssm_>	jeffreymichael: learning curses
Feb 21 00:12:12 <ssm_>	unfortunately curses is not allowed in this channel, so I'll have to censor my routines like 1n1tscr(), f1lt3r(), 3ndscr()
Feb 21 00:12:36 <bane_killgrind>	xx: seems easier than trying to make your body work... Do you have access to physical therapy/ rehab? might be able to get them to help you on fine motor skill stuff
Feb 21 00:13:33 <bane_killgrind>	i thought btrfs had some builtin feature for restores but I guess i'm wrong
Feb 21 00:13:35 <xx>	I'd still prefer to try to force my brain to retrieve the memory of what the contents of that todo file could have been
Feb 21 00:14:06 <xx>	the file was created and then deleted at most 30 minutes later, there's no way it is recoverable
Feb 21 00:14:11 <Random6>	Hello, I just installed scrcpy and it easily streams Android Devices for me to use keyboard and mouse. I am wondering if anyone here has set it up for wireless?
Feb 21 00:14:20 <xx>	Random6: it works
Feb 21 00:14:25 <Random6>	:)
Feb 21 00:14:40 <Random6>	Does wireless require a fast WIFI connection?
Feb 21 00:14:53 <Random6>	I seen online that I can set the bitrate if the connection is too slow
Feb 21 00:14:53 <xx>	yes, but you can use the scrcpy flags to use lower bitrate
Feb 21 00:15:00 <Random6>	^ perfect thanks
Feb 21 00:15:06 <Random6>	Do you use it frequently?
Feb 21 00:15:10 <xx>	yes
Feb 21 00:15:21 <Random6>	If I needed some help tonight to set it up, think you could lend ahand?
Feb 21 00:15:28 <xx>	no guarantees
Feb 21 00:15:32 <Random6>	okay
Feb 21 00:15:44 <ssm_>	ask when you actually run into a problem
Feb 21 00:16:17 <Random6>	Can you point me in the right direction with a website that is reputable?
Feb 21 00:17:08 <ssm_>	https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/doc/connection.md
Feb 21 00:17:12 <Random6>	Thank you
Feb 21 00:17:27 <Random6>	Is github usually a good place to find directions for stuff?
Feb 21 00:17:41 <ssm_>	that's the official project's documentation
Feb 21 00:17:47 <Random6>	nice thank you
Feb 21 00:17:59 <ssm_>	parent folder for all docs: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/tree/master/doc
Feb 21 00:20:38 <Random6>	I wonder if I can get an advantage over players on PUBG using this method lol - while using a mouse and keyboard
Feb 21 00:20:45 <Random6>	PUBG mobile lolz
Feb 21 00:21:15 <ssm_>	could you not just use a usb hub with usb and hdmi/display port with no quality loss?
Feb 21 00:21:23 <ssm_>	it's what I do with my steam deck
Feb 21 00:21:48 <ssm_>	latency on wifi's gonna most likely be awful
Feb 21 00:22:08 <ssm_>	at worst you should try a wired connection, and at that point you might as well just hook up the phone to a monitor
Feb 21 00:23:29 <Random6>	Yes I am fine using wired, I was thinking moreso for phone calls and text messaging I would use wireless.
Feb 21 00:24:15 <Random6>	Do you know if a phone / tablet's USB port can be split into two USB-A inputs?
Feb 21 00:24:35 <Random6>	^ such as USB-Mini 2.0 into 2 USB-A
Feb 21 00:32:28 <TheChinaskiBoy>	playing around with mdns but can't get it to work. using systemd for everything on one host and avahi on the other, the services are running, resolvectl shows the interface +mDNS, -LLMNR, i can nmap the ports, but still get "name or service not found" when pinging the .local on either end, any idea?
Feb 21 00:33:01 <uwharrie>	"pinging" how?
Feb 21 00:33:21 <TheChinaskiBoy>	uwharrie: ping foo.local
Feb 21 00:33:35 <TheChinaskiBoy>	is the search domain in resolv.conf important? that does not have local
Feb 21 00:34:48 <rocks>	.local is a special reserved domain for this purpose and doesn't use regular DNS queries, hence resolv.conf isn't important
Feb 21 00:34:50 <uwharrie>	it's a convenience feature

Feb 21 00:54:23 <Random6>	Debian didn't always have systemd?
Feb 21 00:54:36 <Disconsented>	Correct
Feb 21 00:54:40 <TheChinaskiBoy>	avahi-resolve -a <host ip> times out (but i can ping and nmap the same ip)
Feb 21 00:54:41 <Random6>	interesting
Feb 21 00:54:45 <Disconsented>	systemd is a relatively recent migration
Feb 21 00:55:03 <Random6>	Is it motivated by beaurocracy?
Feb 21 00:56:51 <uwharrie>	Random6: There was some of that. This has some info on the background: https://archive.fo/5Gx8C
Feb 21 00:57:25 <TheChinaskiBoy>	if NetworkManager is running, shouldn't there always be something in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections? or how else can I see the properties of the bridge interface?
Feb 21 01:17:56 <ssm_>	uwharrie: that is a good article, a lot of the systemdebate is just tribalism
Feb 21 01:20:56 <Disconsented>	https://0pointer.de/blog/projects/the-biggest-myths.html is also interesting
Feb 21 01:21:11 <Disconsented>	But in general, we'd prefer to avoid the systemd vs whatever "debate" its rarely productive.
Feb 21 01:21:20 <ssm_>	I think of anyone who can write a commentary on the debate, the uselessd author is a good contender
Feb 21 01:22:08 <phogg>	There aren't too many who have the knowledge and perspective to do it properly who are also not firmly pro- or anti-
Feb 21 01:22:19 <rascul>	i'm pro-beer
Feb 21 01:22:25 <phogg>	I am anti-beer
Feb 21 01:22:30 <phogg>	mead or bust!
Feb 21 01:22:40 <rascul>	mead is acceptable
Feb 21 01:22:42 <ssm_>	I am pro-beer anti-wine pro-coffee anti-decaff
Feb 21 01:23:09 <ssm_>	I have yet to try mead
Feb 21 01:24:23 <phogg>	ssm_: there are many kinds for various occasions. If you try some I recommend starting with a heavy proportion of honey.
Feb 21 01:24:48 <ssm_>	I'll keep that in mind
Feb 21 01:26:18 <VecT0r_X>	hi
Feb 21 01:29:02 <jim>	hi
Feb 21 01:29:11 <Disconsented>	I've never enjoyed alcoholic drinks

Feb 21 02:19:56 <bparker>	is google.com busted for anyone?
Feb 21 02:20:13 <Armand>	Nope
Feb 21 02:21:01 <NeXeN>	WTF GOOGLE.COM HAS GONE BUST!!!
Feb 21 02:21:12 <NeXeN>	oh wait, just cleared the cache....it's good...my bad
Feb 21 02:21:20 <bparker>	Blocked Page   An error occurred during a connection to www.google.com.
Feb 21 02:21:31 <bparker>	never seen this kind of page before
Feb 21 02:21:44 <NeXeN>	your sysadmin has blocked google because he Doesn't Want You To Know.
Feb 21 02:22:12 <bparker>	I am the sysadmin
Feb 21 02:22:40 <NeXeN>	probably shouldn't mix drink and qualudes then
Feb 21 02:23:29 <ssm_>	a sysadmin that blocks google.com is a good sysadmin

Feb 21 02:54:13 <mdogg>	My neighbor's pickup was the victim of a falling tree last night --> https://www.mdogg.com/mdogg/temp/pine.png
Feb 21 02:55:06 <drkshadow>	Is there any way to stat a deleted file? I want to see how large it is. A process creates a temp file, opens it, and immediately deletes it (or somehow-else creates an anonymous file). So that process has a file descriptor for it, and it grows, but I would like to see information on it.
Feb 21 02:55:41 <ananke>	drkshadow: lsof +L1 /filesystem
Feb 21 02:56:01 <ananke>	you're not going to 'stat' it, but you'll see its size. look for 'deleted'
Feb 21 02:56:03 <ayecee>	drkshadow: can you do it from /proc/<pid>/fd of the process that still has it open?
Feb 21 02:57:03 <drkshadow>	aycee: as in, gdb-attach to the process? Sigh..
Feb 21 02:57:07 <ayecee>	no
Feb 21 02:57:13 <ayecee>	where did you get gdb from that
Feb 21 02:57:43 <drkshadow>	ananke: I think that did it..
Feb 21 02:57:51 <mdogg>	I was going to suggest using something like 'debugfs' or 'extundelete' but now that I look at them they don't seem to work for files that are already deleted.
Feb 21 02:58:00 <drkshadow>	ayecee: "of the process" -- it's deleted. Knowing its name doesn't help. The process still has it open.
Feb 21 02:58:45 <ayecee>	drkshadow: you've completely misunderstood me and i don't know how or where.
Feb 21 02:58:46 <drkshadow>	ananke: thanks. :-) Interesting. Hard to read, .
Feb 21 02:58:57 <ayecee>	drkshadow: a process has the file open. the process isn't deleted.
Feb 21 02:59:04 <drkshadow>	aycee: perhaps you've provided an incomplete solution.
Feb 21 02:59:04 <mdogg>	^
Feb 21 02:59:07 <ayecee>	that process has a directory in /proc
Feb 21 02:59:23 <ayecee>	that directory has a fd subdirectory that lists the open file descriptors for the process.
Feb 21 02:59:26 <NeXeN>	mdogg: that's crazy how trees have better aim than lumber jacks
Feb 21 02:59:35 <mdogg>	My ^ was intended to appear after [2024-02-20 17:58:57] <ayecee> drkshadow: a process has the file open. the process isn't deleted.
Feb 21 03:00:01 <drkshadow>	ayecee: Don't stop there. I've done that. Now how do you get the size from that? Try it. DO IT. Then come back and elaborate.
Feb 21 03:00:21 <Khaytsus>	Important question. Do you say "Prock" or "Pross" for /proc
Feb 21 03:00:27 <ayecee>	drkshadow: if you've already done it, and it didn't work, i don't see why you had to work so hard to misunderstand it.
Feb 21 03:00:35 <NeXeN>	i say prock you priss
Feb 21 03:00:46 <ayecee>	drkshadow: it was an idea, not a final and polished solution.
Feb 21 03:00:58 <NeXeN>	it's flied lice you plick
Feb 21 03:01:03 <mdogg>	NeXeN: We've had a ton of super windy days this winter, and it was a pine tree which isn't really all that strong to begin with.  I wonder how much all of that is going to cost.
Feb 21 03:01:31 <drkshadow>	ayecee: you say that I'm misunderstanding something. That I've completely misunderstood you. But it seems I haven't. You simply didn't provide a solution, and I was trying to fill in the blanks to figure out the missing step -- connect to the process with gdb, and call fstat() to get info on the file descriptor.
Feb 21 03:01:42 <NeXeN>	mdogg: i wonder what insurance will cover .....or does it exclude acts of god? crazy because my god don't destroy trees i'm of the chuch of latter day arborists
Feb 21 03:02:12 <drkshadow>	khaytsus: I say "proc"
Feb 21 03:02:14 <ayecee>	drkshadow: that's a bizarre leap. it's no wonder i couldn't follow it.
Feb 21 03:02:44 <rocks>	Here is your $0 payment for your free solution suggestion
Feb 21 03:03:02 <NeXeN>	is that tax deductible or do you have to pay tax on it?
Feb 21 03:03:08 <Khaytsus>	drkshadow: but..........but
Feb 21 03:03:08 <ayecee>	the payments are small but i make it up in volume.
Feb 21 03:03:39 <drkshadow>	khaytsus: :-) Another way to interpret that is: I don't "say" things like this. I have only ever typed them.
Feb 21 03:04:04 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 21 03:04:04 *	litharge removes ban on $a:sam113101$##fix_your_connection
Feb 21 03:04:04 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 21 03:04:26 <mdogg>	Well, the did come from a different neighbors yard (private property) but it fell onto the HOA common area.  I'm not sure who has strict liability, the home owner or the association since it was obviously an act of God.  I do know that my neighbor (the guy with the pickup) won't be responsible for it.  haha
Feb 21 03:04:46 <Khaytsus>	drkshadow: Really?  huh...  I've had to explain it to someone verbally before.  And I say words I read in my head ;)
Feb 21 03:05:03 <drkshadow>	khaytsus: and so it's like seeing a new word, and you say it one day, and everyone's like, "Wut?" -- because the way it sounds in your head isn't the way that everyone else always said it in their head. In this case, there isn't a definition. People say "OOM" like "Boom", and the whole sound just drives me crazy. It's _quicker_, even, for me to say "oh-oh-em". Then, "[b]OOM-killed" is just.. *cringe*
Feb 21 03:05:08 <ayecee>	drkshadow: the fdinfo directory in the same place shows the current position in the file. if it's appending to the deleted file, that would be the size.
Feb 21 03:05:10 <NeXeN>	Khaytsus: i think, because the syllabification is pro-cess, that legitimately it should be "prahss". It's not like the suffix has softened the consonate.....but the quirky nature of english speakers would dictate that you say "prahk" because that's how you read it on screen, like roc or frock
Feb 21 03:05:28 <mdogg>	Like tomato - the people in England say it differently in their head.
Feb 21 03:05:29 <NeXeN>	or should it be prohss?
Feb 21 03:05:35 <Khaytsus>	NeXeN: I do say "pross" myself..  since it is short for process.
Feb 21 03:05:41 <rocks>	OOM-killed is exactly how people say it, not Oh Oh Emm Killed
Feb 21 03:05:45 <NeXeN>	well you're a confirmed weirdo
Feb 21 03:05:47 <SFaulken>	it's "prok" in my head.
Feb 21 03:05:48 <drkshadow>	So anyway, I say it with a k-sound. Neither one is really more correct than the other. Sometimes people take it with context (procedural, process-info filesystem), sometimes they take it visually (what a croc)
Feb 21 03:06:06 <Khaytsus>	rocks: O O O O'Re..wait
Feb 21 03:06:16 <mdogg>	rocks: Don't they say "oooo-mmmm"?
Feb 21 03:06:22 <Khaytsus>	Like monk
Feb 21 03:06:23 <rocks>	Exactamundo
Feb 21 03:06:27 <mdogg>	lol
Feb 21 03:06:31 <SFaulken>	rocks:  uh, actually I absolutely say O O M Killed
Feb 21 03:06:37 <NeXeN>	of course, i find myself outnumbered when I say "Ess-queue-ell" instead of "sequel"
Feb 21 03:06:48 <rocks>	Sequel is MS SQL Server
Feb 21 03:06:51 <NeXeN>	and it irks me to no end when people say "sequel"
Feb 21 03:06:58 <drkshadow>	There are certain sounds that just don't happen in language. It's hard to roll from a consonant into a verb, or vice-versa, so we say "boxez" instead of "box-ess". OOM-killed is the same. It's a hard sound to aurally make. It's wrong.
Feb 21 03:07:00 <SFaulken>	NeXeN:  people that call it sequel are weird, and I don't like it.
Feb 21 03:07:01 <Khaytsus>	Y say "S Q L" too.  But I say "Jay son" for JSON.
Feb 21 03:07:18 <Khaytsus>	s/Y/I/
Feb 21 03:07:19 <drkshadow>	I say "J-S-on". :-)
Feb 21 03:07:30 <rocks>	You people are all mad
Feb 21 03:07:33 <SFaulken>	but I do admit, I say postgres-q-l
Feb 21 03:07:37 <mdogg>	As long as you don't say "Line-Ex"
Feb 21 03:07:43 <drkshadow>	probably because JavaScript has had more impact on me than the serialization format.
Feb 21 03:07:55 <SFaulken>	nope, I say leeeeeeeeeeeenux, jsut to be dramatic.
Feb 21 03:08:02 <drkshadow>	mdogg: I say "lineux", like Torvalds! >:-[
Feb 21 03:08:10 <Khaytsus>	rocks: I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like most of us had.  Cery hard to explain why you're mad even if you're not mad.
Feb 21 03:08:32 <ayecee>	i'm not mad. just a little angry, that's all.
Feb 21 03:08:41 <mdogg>	drkshadow: You should also have an eye patch over one eye and wear a beret to complete the look.
Feb 21 03:08:43 *	Khaytsus hands ayecee a ferret to pet
Feb 21 03:09:09 <hackinghorn>	SeQueL!!
Feb 21 03:09:18 <mdogg>	Maybe a black scoop-neck shirt.

Feb 21 03:09:51 <drkshadow>	nonono

Feb 21 03:10:04 <Khaytsus>	rood
Feb 21 03:10:06 <drkshadow>	If you can, you do. If you can't do, you teach. If you can't teach, you manage.
Feb 21 03:10:19 <drkshadow>	"if you can't, you teach."*
Feb 21 03:10:23 <mdogg>	I can modify .conf files.
Feb 21 03:10:24 <ayecee>	what do you do if you can't manage
Feb 21 03:10:31 <drkshadow>	lol fail up
Feb 21 03:10:32 <mdogg>	And .php files.
Feb 21 03:10:44 <ayecee>	i guess you still manage
Feb 21 03:10:44 <NeXeN>	i say jay-ess-oh-inn
Feb 21 03:10:46 <drkshadow>	the more incompetent a manager is the higher they get promoted.
Feb 21 03:11:00 <hackinghorn>	lol really? thats funny
Feb 21 03:11:08 <ayecee>	ick. cynicism makes me feel gross.
Feb 21 03:11:16 <NeXeN>	but that's because people don't normally pronounce acronyms that aren't meant to be pronounced.....you don't say "ibuhm" for ibm or "oooo-sah" for "usa"
Feb 21 03:11:32 <rocks>	They're not acronyms if you can't pronounce, them, they're initialisms
Feb 21 03:11:34 <espresso>	cynicism, the banner of surrender.
Feb 21 03:11:44 <mdogg>	I have seen that happen before but I do not agree that is how it normally works.
Feb 21 03:11:45 <drkshadow>	away from the technical work -> more removed from the actual things that matter -> promote them up. They can sit around while their underlings get things done. Firing someone is hard/expensive, unless you can show negligence.
Feb 21 03:12:13 <ayecee>	prescriptivist detected
Feb 21 03:12:25 <mdogg>	I mean, look at - wait.  I was going to say the White House but I shouldn't.
Feb 21 03:12:59 <SFaulken>	mdogg: so help me, if you just started a politics discussion, I'm going to lock you in a phone booth with a rabid weasel.
Feb 21 03:13:03 <mdogg>	I take it you have not had very good experience with your supervisors, drkshadow?
Feb 21 03:13:11 <drkshadow>	president: "What is this?" Party member: "Just sign it." president: *rolls eyes, signs*
Feb 21 03:13:12 <mdogg>	SFaulken: Just ignore that line.
Feb 21 03:13:15 <kfrench>	NeXeN: *cough*gif*cough*
Feb 21 03:13:27 <ayecee>	no more politics please
Feb 21 03:13:34 <mdogg>	experiences *
Feb 21 03:13:38 <rocks>	I wonder if managers that work in soup factories are called soupervisors
Feb 21 03:13:41 <drkshadow>	mdogg: it's a larger corporation thing. I stay with smaller corporations. Easy enough for them to perform a round of cost-cutting? *shrug*
Feb 21 03:14:00 <NeXeN>	kfrench: like the peanut butter?
Feb 21 03:14:12 *	kfrench agrees with NeXeN.
Feb 21 03:14:13 <mdogg>	There are advantages and disadvantages to working at both large and small organizations.
Feb 21 03:14:27 <NeXeN>	kfrench: don't point out my inconsistencies when i'm pontificating
Feb 21 03:14:32 <ayecee>	as long as they don't find out about each other
Feb 21 03:14:41 <drkshadow>	mdogg: indeed.. I'm considering an immigration where being at a company with three-times the yearly revenue would halve my taxes. Sigh..
Feb 21 03:14:48 <kfrench>	NeXeN: Sorry, your holiness.
Feb 21 03:14:55 *	NeXeN pardons kfrench
Feb 21 03:15:04 *	NeXeN forever and ever for all posterity
Feb 21 03:15:13 <rocks>	Halving your taxes is easy; just work half the hours
Feb 21 03:15:25 <drkshadow>	rocks: if you're salary, that'll zero your taxes :-P
Feb 21 03:15:28 <mdogg>	Yeah, or make more money.
Feb 21 03:15:35 <drkshadow>	hah, fail up.
Feb 21 03:16:11 <NeXeN>	I have some nice offshore tax shelters you can invest in....turns out if you're scammed of your income *before* you receive it, it's not taxable
Feb 21 03:16:19 <NeXeN>	but you gotta use direct deposit
Feb 21 03:16:50 <mdogg>	How can that happen?
Feb 21 03:17:04 <NeXeN>	you can't, it's a scam, it's not supposed to work
Feb 21 03:17:07 <mdogg>	Before you receive it?  So before a check is issued to you?
Feb 21 03:17:09 <mdogg>	hahaha
Feb 21 03:17:16 <mdogg>	lol - ok.. I gotcha.
Feb 21 03:17:37 <drkshadow>	If I use the immigration method, there are benefits.. but if I *don't* use the immigration method, I don't have to tell them how much I make.
Feb 21 03:17:50 <NeXeN>	duh....and that's pronounced "dee-you-ayche"
Feb 21 03:21:29 <mdogg>	I generally support creative ideas that reduce the amount a person has to pay in taxes, but sometimes a loophole that is designed to save a come tax time will end up costing a lot more in terms of the time and effort it takes to jump through all the hoops so that you qualify.
Feb 21 03:22:24 <mdogg>	I don't know what the 'immigration method' is but it sounds like a pain in the ass.
Feb 21 03:22:34 <NeXeN>	what I don't get is....if you're a bazillionaire, why do you give a flip about paying taxes?
Feb 21 03:22:47 <ayecee>	let's get back to linux
Feb 21 03:22:52 <mdogg>	Yeah
Feb 21 03:23:12 <kfrench>	NeXeN: If you have a bazillion bucks, that means you are a hoarder.  Hoarders do not give up anything - ever.
Feb 21 03:23:58 <NeXeN>	even if tax were 90% on a billion dollars you'd still have 100 million left
Feb 21 03:24:14 <NeXeN>	that's how friggin large a billion is....like orders or magnitude larger than my paycheck
Feb 21 03:24:14 <rbox>	kfrench: but aren't brazillian bucks worthless?
Feb 21 03:24:29 <kfrench>	rbox: To you...
Feb 21 03:24:41 <mdogg>	Does Tux have a birthday?
Feb 21 03:24:56 <rbox>	tux is timeless
Feb 21 03:24:57 <kfrench>	Sept 17, 1991
Feb 21 03:25:03 <mdogg>	Really?
Feb 21 03:25:35 <ayecee>	a creation date, which is almost the same
Feb 21 03:25:43 <NeXeN>	On August 25, 1991, a young Finn named Linus Torvalds typed out a small, now legendary announcement via email to a Minix newsgroup.
Feb 21 03:25:56 <ayecee>	NeXeN: that's for linux, not tux.
Feb 21 03:25:58 <mdogg>	I'm showing 1996, having been designed by Larry Ewing using the X-Face standard and the GIMP.
Feb 21 03:26:01 <NeXeN>	Torvalds put the source code of the first version of his Linux 0.01 online on September 17, 1991.
Feb 21 03:26:08 <NeXeN>	oh, my bad
Feb 21 03:26:23 <mdogg>	Not finding an exact day, though.
Feb 21 03:26:36 <mdogg>	I was going to put that as a yearly calendar event.
Feb 21 03:26:51 <NeXeN>	there was a tux the penguin beanie baby?
Feb 21 03:26:55 <ayecee>	you could use the date on which it was announced as the mascot
Feb 21 03:27:16 <kfrench>	Aug 25 was conception date.  From that day forward, Linus' entire life was going to revolve around that baby.
Feb 21 03:27:19 <ayecee>	i don't know the date of that but i reckon it's more public
Feb 21 03:27:48 <mdogg>	You know, xx asked that question about ideas that could aid in memory recall and I wrote a whole response to him but he went offline before I finished.
Feb 21 03:28:24 <ayecee>	hate it when that happens
Feb 21 03:28:41 <mdogg>	Well, that's twice for me today.
Feb 21 03:28:47 <espresso>	studies have shown that money makes people mean and narcissistic. nevermind. this socialist finds it nauseating :) So yes, Linux!
Feb 21 03:29:11 <mrcoffee>	Hi there, fixed the issue
Feb 21 03:29:21 <mdogg>	Wonderful!
Feb 21 03:29:24 <mrcoffee>	Booting with an older kernel fixed it.
Feb 21 03:29:25 <ayecee>	correlation is not causation
Feb 21 03:29:33 <mrcoffee>	Thanks mdogg
Feb 21 03:29:55 <mrcoffee>	So that did the trick booting with advanced options in ubuntu, and using a previous kernel.
Feb 21 03:30:24 <solol>	sup
Feb 21 03:30:26 <mdogg>	Oh, sheesh.  I can't believe I didn't ask you, "Is this something that has been happening recently or has it always had trouble powering off?"
Feb 21 03:31:35 <mrcoffee>	mdogg the laptop is new and trying to use latest software so i guess it has always happened..
Feb 21 03:31:44 <mdogg>	mrcoffee: I'll take a 20oz cup of whatever you have brewed, if you don't mind.
Feb 21 03:32:36 <mrcoffee>	Got to roast some geisha soon, natural and washed..
Feb 21 03:33:13 <Norkle>	:|~
Feb 21 03:33:14 <NeXeN>	there's nothing I hate more than a friggin news site where the article jumpes around so much because of the adverts that i cant even read the dang thing
Feb 21 03:33:28 *	solol has some coffee brewed
Feb 21 03:33:47 <NeXeN>	or even worse, you try to click on something while the adverts are making it jump around
Feb 21 03:36:05 <mdogg>	mrcoffee: Since the laptop is new, you should consider visiting the manufacture site for the laptop and enter the Files/Drivers section to review the BIOS firmware files they have available.  To check your current BIOS firmware version, run the following in a terminal:     sudo dmidecode -s bios-version
Feb 21 03:36:13 <espresso>	(sorry, must have been a bit crazy day) thought it was a bit late for coffee until SOLOL :)
Feb 21 03:36:19 <mrcoffee>	mdogg yes I Have
Feb 21 03:36:25 <mdogg>	Nice
Feb 21 03:36:34 <mrcoffee>	mdogg Its the dual boot that causes teh trouble..
Feb 21 03:37:00 <mrcoffee>	I reinstalled ubuntu and it was fine, but the moment i touch the windows drive from within ubuntu then i get the issues..
Feb 21 03:37:13 <solol>	It's only 9pm
Feb 21 03:37:19 <solol>	you've got 4-5 hours probly.
Feb 21 03:37:19 <mdogg>	You should disable "Fast Boot" or "Quck Boot" in Windows, and disable hibernation in the Windows Power Management section.
Feb 21 03:37:37 <mdogg>	Actually, you should also disable fast boot in the BIOS, for that matter.
Feb 21 03:37:40 <mrcoffee>	I have disabled fast boot, dont remember why but was causing some issue..
Feb 21 03:37:48 <mdogg>	Yeah, it sucks.
Feb 21 03:38:03 <mrcoffee>	Dont know if I have done in the BIOS mdogg maybe thats the issue..
Feb 21 03:38:36 <mrcoffee>	Modifying grub seemed to fixe things at some point in the last weeks, but now the only thing that does the trick is booting in the older kernel.
Feb 21 03:38:59 <mdogg>	Windows has a similar option someplace.  [2024-02-19 21:32:41] <r1911> mdogg: fast startup
Feb 21 03:39:00 <mrcoffee>	Will check if there is fast boot in the BIOS..
Feb 21 03:39:27 <mrcoffee>	But the issue is causes by accesing the windows drive from within Ubuntu in the ne 6.5 kernel Ubuntu
Feb 21 03:39:44 <mrcoffee>	No issues if using the 6.2 kernel
Feb 21 03:40:55 <NeXeN>	why'd he quit when I was trying to autocomplete his name?
Feb 21 03:41:35 <Armand>	:P
Feb 21 03:41:42 <mdogg>	Those settings that I suggested modifying "disable hibernation in Windows" "Disable fast startup in Windows" and "Disable Fast Boot in BIOS" probably won't resolve the issue you're having writing to NTFS with the new kernel, but in general they have been known to cause issues when writing to a NTFS partition with Windows installed on it in general.
Feb 21 03:41:43 <ayecee>	spidey sense was tingling
Feb 21 03:42:09 <mdogg>	Oh
Feb 21 03:42:15 <mdogg>	Well, whatever.
Feb 21 03:42:26 <kfrench>	ayecee: lice?
Feb 21 03:42:43 <ayecee>	no thanks, never touch the stuff
Feb 21 03:45:17 <NeXeN>	you know what I do touch? new files in a shell script
Feb 21 03:45:44 <ayecee>	not gonna touch that one
Feb 21 03:45:48 <mdogg>	Use the doll and show us where you touch them.
Feb 21 03:45:54 *	nvz reports NeXeN for touching young files
Feb 21 03:46:01 <Norkle>	LOL!
Feb 21 03:46:14 <nvz>	xD
Feb 21 03:46:31 <nvz>	seems I'm not the only one whose mind went there
Feb 21 03:46:51 <kfrench>	nvz: pst.  You're files unzipped.
Feb 21 03:46:57 <nvz>	it would seem as though we all had the thought simultaneously
Feb 21 03:47:21 <CoJaBo>	An app I had to work with years ago would not start if some "Latin-A" bitmap font was not installed
Feb 21 03:47:34 <CoJaBo>	The easiest fix for this was the command..............  `touch latina`
Feb 21 03:47:40 <nvz>	xD
Feb 21 03:47:41 <CoJaBo>	I refuse to believe this was accidental.
Feb 21 03:47:51 <espresso>	heh, I appreciate that jest as a fan of noirs :)  solol: yes, I can be up late *brews doubles for the channel, some with foam and amateurish Tux designs*
Feb 21 03:48:10 <nvz>	CoJaBo: idk I've heard if you even look at latina long enough...
Feb 21 03:48:35 <solol>	Hm...
Feb 21 03:48:37 <nvz>	they can have a baby right there in coat check
Feb 21 03:48:48 <solol>	lol
Feb 21 03:49:49 <nvz>	you know, they don't LOL in Hawaii, cause it's a lo ha state..
Feb 21 03:50:00 <whiskey76>	aha haha
Feb 21 03:50:11 <CoJaBo>	The same company (I think) had a replacement login shell for Windows XP, that was called something like Verisomething Authenticator, or VA for short. You can do the math on what the .dll file was named.
Feb 21 03:50:57 <CoJaBo>	IT people are bad at naming things, but when we do, we make them vaguely creepy.
Feb 21 03:51:46 <ayecee>	i guess it wasn't VA.dll
Feb 21 03:52:10 <iddqd>	men, i've seen arrow of seven spacecrafts in the sky, you call them string, it was beatiful image, i am impressed!
Feb 21 03:52:13 <mdogg>	Yeah, I was associating it with Veteran Affairs.
Feb 21 03:52:14 <espresso>	(ahem, I meant fan of scandi noirs :P)
Feb 21 03:52:14 <kfrench>	ayecee: It's for the Graphical Identification and Authentication piece of windows
Feb 21 03:52:30 <CoJaBo>	Yep.
Feb 21 03:52:43 <kfrench>	CoJaBo: Sometimes it's not even vague
Feb 21 03:52:58 <mdogg>	ladygarden.dll
Feb 21 03:53:02 <CoJaBo>	Which they of course did not accronym as GIA or GIAA, because that'd make too much sense.
Feb 21 03:53:35 <CoJaBo>	mdogg: It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't have a propensity for generating BSODs if the network ever went down.
Feb 21 03:54:23 <mdogg>	I'm not familiar with Versionsomething Authentication.
Feb 21 03:54:51 <ayecee>	being familiar is not important to the story
Feb 21 03:55:08 <mdogg>	I am going to go down and make myself some coffee.  Back in a few.
Feb 21 03:55:09 <CoJaBo>	I don't remember the name, but yeh, it's the accronym that's relevent. Classy.
Feb 21 03:55:25 <mdogg>	ayecee: I'm finding that out.
Feb 21 03:56:20 <mdogg>	The word "laser" is an acronym.
Feb 21 03:56:29 <CoJaBo>	My names are not nearly as interesting. The worst I've had recently is a product called Regicide, which had it's major release right about the time the Queen died.
Feb 21 03:57:04 <CoJaBo>	It has now been fully swallowed up by our JSON-AI™ (which doesn't really have a formal name, but that's what I'm going with)
Feb 21 03:57:54 <mdogg>	Why not jAIson?
Feb 21 03:59:12 <CoJaBo>	It is now named jAIson. =D
Feb 21 03:59:19 <mdogg>	jAiSON
Feb 21 03:59:27 <CoJaBo>	Perfection.
Feb 21 04:00:37 <CoJaBo>	We already have components named things like &rAIa lol
Feb 21 04:01:21 <mdogg>	I think I should be granted a generous percentage of stock given the powerful brand potential.  What do you think about 10%?
Feb 21 04:02:23 <ayecee>	i think it would come across as mercantile when the movie comes out
Feb 21 04:04:01 <CoJaBo>	The original product of mine that jAIson consumed was named BOSS; Bride of Son of Schotty. Which was a rewrite by me of of someone else's SoSII, Son of Schotty...2?. Which I guess rewrote SoS 1, which eventually at some point traces its lineage back to my original Schotty anti-spam which I wrote circa 2005.
Feb 21 04:04:06 <CoJaBo>	Fun times.
Feb 21 04:04:37 <mdogg>	The antagonist will wear a fedora and have Edward Scissorhand gloves that he uses to slash people who  use XML.
Feb 21 04:04:40 <ayecee>	got a whole family tree going on there
Feb 21 04:04:47 <mdogg>	Er, protagonist.
Feb 21 04:05:11 <CoJaBo>	Yeh, someone actually made a visual family tree of all of the Schotty forks. There are lots of them lol
Feb 21 04:05:24 <ayecee>	they can both wear that
Feb 21 04:05:33 <ayecee>	more true to life
Feb 21 04:06:10 <CoJaBo>	Someone made a logo for BOSS and it's kind of funny. Businesswoman in businesswoman clothes wearing one of those wedding veil things.
Feb 21 04:06:28 <CoJaBo>	I think it was just a mashup of emojis
Feb 21 04:06:41 <ayecee>	even the eggplant
Feb 21 04:11:21 <CoJaBo>	Thankfully no, but jAIson includes a component that's just named 🍆⃠
Feb 21 04:11:41 <CoJaBo>	I dunno if that sent right, but it's a crossed-out eggplant
Feb 21 04:12:42 <ayecee>	works for me
Feb 21 04:15:11 <CoJaBo>	Our Reddit binding for it is named libf***spez, which is also pretty amusing
Feb 21 04:15:49 <mdogg>	I thought the eggplant was heading east, northeast.
Feb 21 04:16:03 <mdogg>	Sorry, west.  duh
Feb 21 04:16:15 <mdogg>	West, northwest.
Feb 21 04:18:46 <CoJaBo>	N🍆rth by N🍆rthw🍆st
Feb 21 04:20:33 <mdogg>	In that case it would point a bit more to the 11:00 position.
Feb 21 04:23:47 <CoJaBo>	jAIson also very horiffically abuses SQLite. We've got multi-terabyte databases with replication, and it's just out of control at this point.
Feb 21 04:23:53 <mdogg>	I do not encourage the use of emoticons, but I think you were looking for 🚫, CoJaBo
Feb 21 04:25:15 <CoJaBo>	Yeh, it won't let me paste a combining emoji, dunno why.
Feb 21 04:25:36 <mdogg>	That's alright.  Let's both agree to not use them anymore.
Feb 21 04:34:52 <jasassin>	is there a way to limit io used by a process... for example limiting disk io while extracting a tar so it uses less cpu and disk io but takes longer
Feb 21 04:35:13 <Disconsented>	cgroups
Feb 21 04:35:29 <espresso>	ionice
Feb 21 04:36:36 <mdogg>	Nice
Feb 21 04:36:53 <kfrench>	noice
Feb 21 04:37:09 <mdogg>	You could make the process more 'nice' and it will allow other processes priority.
Feb 21 04:37:27 <jasassin>	ionice
Feb 21 04:37:30 <jasassin>	nice!
Feb 21 04:37:36 <jasassin>	that's exactly it!
Feb 21 04:37:46 <mdogg>	Be careful with very high or low values - don't get too near the edge.
Feb 21 04:37:50 <jasassin>	but that's not quite it....
Feb 21 04:38:03 <NeXeN>	nice is inversely related to priority
Feb 21 04:38:24 <mdogg>	The nicer a process gets the less priority it is given.
Feb 21 04:38:36 <jasassin>	it will still use 100% disk io if nothing else is using it... so it wont really have much impact on lag during disk io
Feb 21 04:38:40 <mdogg>	The less nice a process the more it demands time and attention.
Feb 21 04:38:58 *	NeXeN renice -10 mdogg
Feb 21 04:39:02 *	NeXeN nice puppy
Feb 21 04:39:11 <kfrench>	how rude
Feb 21 04:39:15 <jasassin>	im familiar with nice quite a bit but i just right now learned about ionice
Feb 21 04:39:43 <jasassin>	even with ionice i mean
Feb 21 04:39:44 <mdogg>	Why not just let Linux determine what to do?
Feb 21 04:39:53 <kfrench>	jasassin: Ya, ionice will still soak up all of the available IO.  cgroups can put a hard cap on it though
Feb 21 04:40:09 <jasassin>	kfrench: thanks man!
Feb 21 04:40:20 <ayecee>	it sure makes it easier to solve problems when you can redefine the problem
Feb 21 04:41:31 <NeXeN>	redefine -> resolve?
Feb 21 04:41:33 <mdogg>	I missed the problem entirely.
Feb 21 04:41:38 <jasassin>	ayecee: first question: is there a way to limit io used by a process... for example limiting disk io while extracting a tar so it uses less cpu and disk io but takes longer
Feb 21 04:41:44 <jasassin>	stop being a dick
Feb 21 04:41:58 <jasassin>	you better be nice to me or i'll broil you on the top rack!
Feb 21 04:42:00 <mdogg>	Nobody in here is being a dick, bro.
Feb 21 04:42:12 <ayecee>	jasassin: stop being so sensitive. i was talking about mdogg's redefinition.
Feb 21 04:42:14 <Disconsented>	Huh?
Feb 21 04:42:39 <jasassin>	who gives a shit, it's a dick thing to say
Feb 21 04:42:46 <mdogg>	What is?
Feb 21 04:42:49 <NeXeN>	i think they said ionice
Feb 21 04:43:02 *	themachine is offended on someone elses behalf
Feb 21 04:43:22 <jasassin>	 it sure makes it easier to solve problems when you can redefine the problem
Feb 21 04:43:24 <kfrench>	themachine: Thanks.  I'll rest easier tonight because of you.
Feb 21 04:43:26 <NeXeN>	jasassin: look, no one likes being talked to wrong....but first you need alligator skin
Feb 21 04:43:29 <mdogg>	themachine: You can fill this out -> https://www.mdogg.com/mdogg/pics/misc/butthurt_report.png
Feb 21 04:43:30 <jasassin>	that just pissed me off for some reason
Feb 21 04:43:43 <ayecee>	jasassin: you're right. i apologize.
Feb 21 04:44:16 <peter-cauc>	hi
Feb 21 04:44:21 <Disconsented>	I'm lost here, how was what ayecee said a problem?
Feb 21 04:44:23 <mdogg>	Hello there.
Feb 21 04:44:34 <mdogg>	I haven't got a clue either, Disconsented.
Feb 21 04:44:35 <espresso>	yeah, best answer cgroups. like they said, ionice does not really limit in that way :) I may have new use for cgroups rsync..
Feb 21 04:44:40 <ayecee>	Disconsented: it was a snide remark.
Feb 21 04:44:51 <ayecee>	it was intended as such.
Feb 21 04:44:57 <Random6>	Can Linux / Debian safely unlock and utilize windows 11 bitlocker drives?
Feb 21 04:45:02 <mdogg>	Shouldn't it be me that took offense?

Feb 21 04:45:19 <ayecee>	mdogg: nope.
Feb 21 04:45:39 <ayecee>	one can recognize snide remarks without being the target of them.
Feb 21 04:46:03 <themachine>	Random6: I've used the cinnamon file manager to decrypt a bitlocker drive in debian
Feb 21 04:46:28 <themachine>	so, yes
Feb 21 04:46:28 <mdogg>	Random6: Use LUKS encryption.  It's native to Linux.
Feb 21 04:46:45 <mdogg>	Well, I'm just a LUKS guy I guess.
Feb 21 04:46:53 <themachine>	windows can't read LUKS though can it?
Feb 21 04:47:30 <Random6>	Thanks themachine. ;)
Feb 21 04:47:46 <mdogg>	It can with something called 'dislocker' but even then it may require additional setup and even after that, Windows may not be able to access the disk 100% properly.
Feb 21 04:48:08 <NeXeN>	themachine: you can use it through wsl
Feb 21 04:48:15 <themachine>	NeXeN: oh I never thought about that
Feb 21 04:48:21 <themachine>	hm
Feb 21 04:48:26 <espresso>	Random6: https://man.archlinux.org/man/cryptsetup.8#BITLK_(WINDOWS_BITLOCKER_COMPATIBLE)_EXTENSION seems available, fwiw
Feb 21 04:48:37 <NeXeN>	i think also like librecrypt?
Feb 21 04:48:55 <mdogg>	Windows shouldn't be accessing a native Linux partition anyway, IMO.  You can create an nfs or SAMBA share if you want to work between Linux and Windows safely.  At least that's how I feel about it.
Feb 21 04:49:00 <Random6>	I already have 150GB on the drive, would it be a good idea to transfer the data onto a different drive, and encrypt an empty drive?
Feb 21 04:49:08 <Random6>	*quicker for sure
Feb 21 04:49:45 <mdogg>	You can use 'cryptsetup' to encrypt wait..
Feb 21 04:50:05 <Random6>	Zulucrypt I have used with windows and linux without issue
Feb 21 04:50:10 <mdogg>	Actually, I have never tried to LUKS encrypt a disk with data on it.  Probably a better idea to backup the data and start from scratch.
Feb 21 04:50:26 <mdogg>	Be sure to backup the data first if you make any changes at all, really.
Feb 21 04:50:28 <Random6>	Okay. I think so too
Feb 21 04:50:34 <hays>	im running services on a public server with docker, have firewall blocking ports, and using nginx as reverse proxy with http basic auth... any structural issues with that?
Feb 21 04:50:37 <NeXeN>	some people also use linux in a vm to decrypt the luks then share with samba across the virtual lan
Feb 21 04:50:47 <Random6>	^ interesting
Feb 21 04:51:02 <Random6>	You mean transfering data between host and vm?
Feb 21 04:51:11 <mdogg>	NeXeN: That's very common.  Nice comment.
Feb 21 04:51:24 <NeXeN>	but i would be more worried about guest OS access to the FS
Feb 21 04:51:35 <NeXeN>	err, I know people who worry about wsl luks
Feb 21 04:52:16 <nullvalue>	ew, the mention of wsl makes me throw up in the mouth a little
Feb 21 04:52:50 <mdogg>	You would run Linux in a virtual machine, which then could decrypt a LUKS encrypted device or partition, and then access the data.  That partition/directory can then be shared with Windows by setting it up through SAMBA.
Feb 21 04:53:03 <peter-cauc>	how can i know aviable port in system.my ip_local_port_range is 32768 60999
Feb 21 04:53:03 <peter-cauc>	when i use connect function to connect localhost port 9000,
Feb 21 04:53:03 <peter-cauc>	connect function tell me EADDRNOTAVAIL
Feb 21 04:53:03 <peter-cauc>	use netstat or ss i found not many connection from 127.0.0.1:x to 127.0.0.1:9000
Feb 21 04:53:03 <peter-cauc>	why connect has no resource to connect localhost:9000
Feb 21 04:53:11 <NeXeN>	peter-cauc: don't paste in here....use a pastebin
Feb 21 04:53:36 <NeXeN>	or did you just get pingged out real bad?
Feb 21 04:53:36 <Random6>	Okay. Would it work similarly with an LUKS encrypted file mdogg?
Feb 21 04:54:08 <Random6>	I don't want to do a partition or drive unless I need to.  I just need 50GB of encryption
Feb 21 04:54:10 <mdogg>	So long as it is decrypted first.  Nothing can access the file, partition, or block device when it is encrypted.
Feb 21 04:54:16 <Random6>	ok
Feb 21 04:54:44 <NeXeN>	Random6: maybe you could run linux on a raspberryPI and have it read the file via samba then feed it back via samba
Feb 21 04:54:54 <Random6>	interesting
Feb 21 04:54:58 <NeXeN>	like a decryption appliance
Feb 21 04:55:25 <NeXeN>	you can mount images in linux with luks just like partitions
Feb 21 04:55:43 <NeXeN>	alot of people do that do get the keys from their android internal storage sd cards
Feb 21 04:55:52 <NeXeN>	s/keys/data
Feb 21 04:55:58 <mdogg>	Well, I shouldn't say 'nothing can access it'.   If you have a LUKS encrypted ext4 partition, someone could always delete the partition completely and create a new one in its place.  Then they would have access to that partition but the data that was there is lost forever.
Feb 21 04:56:39 <Random6>	Yeah that's ho9w I want to use it - mounting encrypted images lol
Feb 21 04:57:14 <mdogg>	And it's a little tricky to delete a partition if it has not been decrypted.  It can be done but it can be a bit tricky.
Feb 21 04:57:16 <SponiX>	mdogg: yes, full disk encryption is the best way to lose all of your data easily ;)
Feb 21 04:57:34 <SponiX>	I highly recommend it
Feb 21 04:57:35 <mdogg>	SponiX: I use that on my block devices containing /home.
Feb 21 04:57:48 <mdogg>	SponiX: https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/c0de41261581
Feb 21 04:57:59 <NeXeN>	https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/504230/mount-encrypted-partition-of-an-image-file
Feb 21 04:58:42 <Random6>	If I was to lose an encrypted file by accidentally quick formatting a drive that it is stored on, could I easily restore it?
Feb 21 04:58:52 <SponiX>	mdogg: way too advanced for me
Feb 21 04:58:53 <Random6>	Versus loosing an entire encrypted drive to a quick format?
Feb 21 04:59:23 <mdogg>	No, not easily.  It would be as easy as recovering any file on a disk you accidently quick formatted.
Feb 21 04:59:49 <mdogg>	Formats are always quick unless you use Windows to do it.
Feb 21 05:00:05 <Random6>	What software would you recommend for restoring quick formatted data?
Feb 21 05:00:11 <Random6>	In linux??
Feb 21 05:00:14 <SponiX>	mdogg: https://termbin.com/jj7f
Feb 21 05:00:34 <Random6>	ok
Feb 21 05:02:34 <mdogg>	There are different recovery tools like 'ext3grep' 'ext4grep' 'testdisk' - and there are a bunch more on github.
Feb 21 05:02:40 <Random6>	ok
Feb 21 05:03:07 <SponiX>	Random6: I recommend just pulling it back in from your backups
Feb 21 05:03:18 <Random6>	Alright
Feb 21 05:04:20 <mdogg>	Just   Being proactive is smarter than being reactive so just do frequent backups of your data (usually the /home directory in Linux) and you won't have to worry about trying to recover from a catastrophe if a disk fails or if something is accidently wiped.
Feb 21 05:05:11 <circuitbone>	worship more cron
Feb 21 05:05:12 <mdogg>	And a lot of those recovery tools only work if the sun and moon happen to align properly with Jupiter.  There are no guarantees that they can help.
Feb 21 05:05:17 <Random6>	Yeah true. Sincerely had an issue recently, when doing a factory reset of windows 11, it wiped both my main nvme ssd, and also a seperate data nvme ssd. First time windows did that to me. I lost some data.
Feb 21 05:06:01 <Random6>	* If I use trim on an ssd though, wouldn't that increase the likelihood ot restoring those particular chunks of the ssd?
Feb 21 05:06:09 <mdogg>	Everybody in here has borked an important data directory at least one time in their life.
Feb 21 05:06:10 <SponiX>	Random6: lol ... Trust in Microsoft will often lead to data loss at some point
Feb 21 05:06:21 <Random6>	hahaha
Feb 21 05:06:27 <Random6>	Yes, I learned that the hard way.
Feb 21 05:06:52 <mdogg>	That's how a lot of what we learn is etched into our mind.
Feb 21 05:08:09 <scottpedia>	mdogg: borked?
Feb 21 05:08:15 <circuitbone>	https://crontab.guru/
Feb 21 05:08:27 <espresso>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_recovery lists a few more and warnings, but none of those could save the two SATA disks I slayed by using a cable from a different PSU. (just thankfully, they were not important drives)
Feb 21 05:08:42 <Random6>	lol. Like the time I spilled coca cola on my X250 keyboard and fried the keyboard and mousepad.
Feb 21 05:08:56 <Random6>	Or the time I washed my Google Pixel 7 in a hottub jet, and borked the screen
Feb 21 05:08:58 <scottpedia>	Random6: do you know that msft when windows 10 was released promised that there wouldn't be a windows 11?
Feb 21 05:09:08 <Random6>	lol
Feb 21 05:09:19 <scottpedia>	don't trust msft
Feb 21 05:09:20 <mdogg>	I remember when I was first learning Windows NT 3.51, I saw the "Everyone" group had 'full-control' to the C drive and all directories recursively.  I said to myself, "I'm going to add 'system' 'administrators' 'mdogg' 'network-ops' and give them full-control, and I don't want everybody to have full control so I'll DENY  the 'Everyone' group.
Feb 21 05:10:13 <scottpedia>	gates have become full delusional in recent yeas
Feb 21 05:10:17 <scottpedia>	years*
Feb 21 05:10:35 <mdogg>	I learned then that DENY permissions take precedence over ALLOW permissions.
Feb 21 05:11:03 <SFaulken>	mdogg:  yeah, that behavior drives me nuts.
Feb 21 05:11:19 <scottpedia>	mdogg: yes windows operating systems listen to the superuser that's not even accisble to actual humane users
Feb 21 05:11:25 <SFaulken>	I understand why they do it, but it completely doesn't compute in my brain, everytime I encounter it.
Feb 21 05:11:29 <mdogg>	Actually, it makes sense to me now.  I just didn't understand it at first.
Feb 21 05:11:49 <scottpedia>	accessible*
Feb 21 05:12:05 <Random6>	Anyone here used thunderbolt 4 external GPU in Linux successfully?
Feb 21 05:12:22 <SFaulken>	Random6:  not personally, but I know people do it.
Feb 21 05:12:34 <Random6>	So I can assume safely it works?
Feb 21 05:12:43 <scottpedia>	and they inplanted an NSA decryption in the bitlocker utility
Feb 21 05:12:43 <espresso>	i've seen people have problems with it, but not sure of the nature of that
Feb 21 05:12:48 <scottpedia>	key*
Feb 21 05:12:58 <espresso>	arch forums probably have more info
Feb 21 05:13:02 <SFaulken>	Random6:  you can safely assume that it works for some people, yes.
Feb 21 05:13:38 <mdogg>	As a security measure, you always want users to have the minimum necessary access required so they can perform their necessary duties.  So it stands to reason that there should be no access unless you explisitly allow access.  And if you mark something as denied, then it is disallowed everywhere to ensure it isn't inadvertently allowed someplace else.
Feb 21 05:13:43 <mdogg>	I may not be explaining it very well.
Feb 21 05:13:51 <SFaulken>	I would generally say right now, your experience with the Radeon 7000 series cards might be a little iffy, but that's try when you've got it plugged into an PCIe slot as well.
Feb 21 05:14:12 <SFaulken>	Nvidia, I have no clue, as I really don't pay attention to Nvidida
Feb 21 05:16:05 <Random6>	I got an intel integrated IRIS XE, and it is about the same speed as a GTX 750ti. It is pretty good for a little bastard
Feb 21 05:16:40 <circuitbone>	I think they mean POLP principle of least privilege
Feb 21 05:16:42 <White_Flame>	I wonder why the iris graphics always seemed to be so rare in models
Feb 21 05:17:27 <Random6>	They are rare?
Feb 21 05:18:12 <White_Flame>	I looked around for them all the time, and never really saw them in much beyond Apple products and 1 or 2 overpriced nucs. Not sure if they have more out there today, but I stopped paying attention once AMD's APUs became stronger
Feb 21 05:18:24 <SFaulken>	mainly because Intel only shipped them on relatively high-end mobile CPU's, and then got distracted by Alchemist and making their own discrete GPU's
Feb 21 05:18:46 <ayecee>	possibly limited demand for same
Feb 21 05:18:48 <Random6>	interesting
Feb 21 05:19:28 <Random6>	I will try Skyrim on it tonight
Feb 21 05:19:41 <ayecee>	a narrow intersection between those who want performant gpu and those who want an integrated gpu
Feb 21 05:19:58 <SFaulken>	I game on my APU, and I'm pretty much perfectly happy with it.
Feb 21 05:20:34 <Random6>	Yeah. My lenovo has a thunderbolt 4 port, but only one. So I would be using the laptops battery to run games lol. It would only last an hour or two
Feb 21 05:20:35 <ayecee>	fine. between those who are willing to stump up extra cache for a integrated gpu.
Feb 21 05:21:04 <ayecee>	cash
Feb 21 05:21:15 <ayecee>	these fingers have a mind of their own.
Feb 21 05:21:19 <White_Flame>	that 128MB eDRAM back then was unobtanium as well
Feb 21 05:21:29 <SFaulken>	I honestly thought I'd want to invest in an external enclosure and card, but I really don't.
Feb 21 05:21:33 <White_Flame>	(in terms of actually "cache" ;) )
Feb 21 05:22:20 <mdogg>	Lets say you have a 'users' group and all of your employees are in that group, and you also have some employees in a 'helpdesk' group because they work in the Help Desk.  It's a good idea to create a 'terminated' group (or something like that) where users go when they are no longer with the company.  You would DENY 'terminated' which obviously includes all of the users within that group.  And those users cannot access any resource even if someone
Feb 21 05:22:20 <mdogg>	forgets to remove a particular user from 'users' or 'helpdesk'.
Feb 21 05:22:21 <mdogg>	They will also be denied access to all resources even if they were explicitly allowed access to a resource by name and their username was never removed when they left the company.
Feb 21 05:23:41 <ayecee>	subtractive permissions are tricky.
Feb 21 05:24:28 <ayecee>	sensitive to evaluation order, and you'd also have to tag all new resources with that deny.
Feb 21 05:24:50 <truth>	Hi, I see Linux foundation is advertising special deals for its courses and promoting "career" advancement help. Just wondering if I could get some takes from community here to see if it's worth taking their courses to get started on a Linux career change path? And how easy would it be to go from scratch and get a career going provided enough
Feb 21 05:24:50 <truth>	motivation to do so?
Feb 21 05:25:07 <mdogg>	Great point, ayecee.
Feb 21 05:25:57 <cappy>	Besides borg CLI, can anyone recommend a backup program (GUI) that ignores CACHEDIR.TAG'd directories?
Feb 21 05:26:03 <ayecee>	truth: i've been told by a recruiter that some certification, really any certification, demonstrates interest and a commitment to continuing education.
Feb 21 05:26:14 <espresso>	whatever can be said of Gates, at least he recognized Richard Feynman as 'the best teacher I never had'
Feb 21 05:26:21 <Armand>	Who?
Feb 21 05:26:23 <White_Flame>	truth: I'd think most people here are enthusiasts that are self-taught. But if you aren't and want to bootstrap yourself into useful & sellable linux skills, from my uninformed opinion that would seem fine
Feb 21 05:26:37 <SponiX>	truth: https://linuxjourney.com -- Basics are covered for free there
Feb 21 05:26:54 <White_Flame>	truth: but you do need to then become an enthusiast that keeps up with things, and not just sit on that knowledge
Feb 21 05:27:12 <ayecee>	yup. an old cert with no new certs is not an asset.
Feb 21 05:27:28 <ayecee>	it kinda marks where you stepped off the treadmill.
Feb 21 05:28:04 <mdogg>	Unless you are demonstrating that you are continuing growth and development by actively working in  and participating in it.
Feb 21 05:28:45 <truth>	Thanks guys, that is all super helpful
Feb 21 05:29:01 <truth>	Will check out those links thank you!
Feb 21 05:29:14 <mdogg>	Exactly.  A medical doctor who decided to take a 15 year sabbatical isn't going to be on the top of the list of candidates that a hospital wants to hire.
Feb 21 05:29:53 <truth>	The thing I love about the Linux / open source communities, is that for the most part it's a very friendly & supportive environment.
Feb 21 05:30:01 <cappy>	As per: https://bford.info/cachedir/
Feb 21 05:30:26 <mdogg>	Are you using a Linux operating system right now, truth?
Feb 21 05:30:33 <Random6>	Anyone know why a mini keyboard to a tablet would start glitching out when I press a bunch of keys at the same time? I needed to leave it for 12 hours before it started working again.
Feb 21 05:30:35 <cappy>	I need to filter Rust's "target" dirs.
Feb 21 05:30:50 <White_Flame>	Random6: dying battery, or reboot it
Feb 21 05:30:58 <Random6>	ok
Feb 21 05:31:01 <White_Flame>	(else it's just crap)
Feb 21 05:31:10 <White_Flame>	reboot the keyboard I man
Feb 21 05:31:13 <White_Flame>	*mean
Feb 21 05:31:28 <truth>	mdogg not for everyday use - but experimenting :)
Feb 21 05:31:32 <Random6>	I did that a few times and it didn't work that night. But the next morning it started working again.
Feb 21 05:31:43 <White_Flame>	truth: the only way to really learn is to daily drive it, not just boot it optionally
Feb 21 05:31:46 <Random6>	Hasn't replicated the same issue since
Feb 21 05:31:50 <mdogg>	The more you use it the faster you will begin to understand how it works.
Feb 21 05:32:04 <White_Flame>	sort of like learning a spoken language, immersion
Feb 21 05:32:17 <truth>	Makes sense. Do most of you here use Linux operating system as your daily driver for everything?
Feb 21 05:32:22 <White_Flame>	I do
Feb 21 05:32:36 <SponiX>	lol
Feb 21 05:32:46 <SponiX>	truth: I have since roughly 1996
Feb 21 05:32:49 <White_Flame>	I even play tons of games via emulators. I'm a trailing edge gamer
Feb 21 05:33:07 <truth>	Sheesh that's impressive
Feb 21 05:33:14 <espresso>	well, yes.  and wine is impressive
Feb 21 05:33:29 <lockywolf>	are there some Pi-like machines with nvme?
Feb 21 05:33:47 <truth>	Is it mainly philosophically driven - because I assume somethings are somewhat easier or more convenient on a proprietary system?
Feb 21 05:33:47 <ayecee>	like, arm-based single board computers?
Feb 21 05:33:55 <mdogg>	I've spoken with several people who have taken a variety of different Coursera courses and they all have said that it was a very positive experience.  I just did a quick search for 'Linux', truth - here are some courses that came up --> https://www.coursera.org/search?query=linux
Feb 21 05:33:59 <White_Flame>	I've said for a few years that Linux is now the best desktop operating system. Not that it's necessarily gotten that much better, but that win & mac have gotten that much worse :-P
Feb 21 05:34:18 <ayecee>	well if you've said it for a few years, then it carries more weight.
Feb 21 05:34:33 <White_Flame>	in my experience, hardware support even for things like game controllers are way more plug and play on linux than on other systems
Feb 21 05:34:46 <mdogg>	truth: But like ayecee said, if you aren't constantly trying to apply what you are learning even after the course is complete, then any certificate or degree is meaningless.
Feb 21 05:34:59 <espresso>	truth: philosophical, technical
Feb 21 05:35:00 <truth>	mdogg, thanks sir! I've explored them and Udemy too - bunch of good looking stuff out there. Reason I was thinking Linux Foundation was because I thought it might lead to good networking opportunities too and linking with other Linux nerds
Feb 21 05:35:12 <White_Flame>	ayecee: I just mean it's not a recent thing, the shift happened quite a while ago
Feb 21 05:35:13 <ayecee>	mdogg: not really what i meant
Feb 21 05:35:43 <lockywolf>	ayecee: no necessarily arm-based
Feb 21 05:35:43 <ayecee>	mdogg: i meant that you have to continue getting certifications, whether you apply them or not.
Feb 21 05:35:54 <ayecee>	lockywolf: so, single board computer?
Feb 21 05:36:01 <lockywolf>	just a small-sized computer
Feb 21 05:36:06 <truth>	White_Flame haha good to know! Interested to see what happens within the AI space between the systems too!
Feb 21 05:36:07 <mdogg>	Oh, that's what I inferred when you mentioned "stepping off the treadmill after you get the certificate"
Feb 21 05:36:15 <mdogg>	Oh oh oh
Feb 21 05:36:33 <ayecee>	lockywolf: so, pi-like in what way?
Feb 21 05:36:35 <bradd>	lockywolf: A quick search of 'rpi 5 nvme' shows a hat for the rpi5 thats nvme
Feb 21 05:36:45 <lockywolf>	yeah, I did that search too
Feb 21 05:36:49 <espresso>	lockywolf: i use a Pi 4b with Argon One case which has M.2. (though I'm on desktop atm)
Feb 21 05:37:15 <Mithian>	join #python
Feb 21 05:37:16 <lockywolf>	espresso: hard to get up and running?
Feb 21 05:37:22 <lockywolf>	does it need a fan?
Feb 21 05:37:28 <lockywolf>	Mithian: no
Feb 21 05:37:32 <ayecee>	mdogg: at least, for them to be of value in a job search.
Feb 21 05:37:39 <Mithian>	it was a typo, not an advertisement request :-p
Feb 21 05:39:07 <bparker>	04:34 < White_Flame> in my experience, hardware support even for things like game controllers are way more plug and play on linux than on other systems
Feb 21 05:39:12 <bparker>	I have had the complete opposite experience
Feb 21 05:39:13 <mdogg>	Well, I'm not sure if I completely agree with that.  I mean, if you have an MBA with a major in accounting and you are the comptroller for the city of Phoenix and you plan on working in that capacity until you retire -- you are always (hopefully) surrounded by people and tasks which challenge you.  So it really isn't necessary for you to obtain a PhD in accounting for you to stay competent and economically viable.
Feb 21 05:39:28 <espresso>	lockywolf: Argon case has a fan but it's probably not that necessary. actually I have it using a USB as only drive. Can net install raspbian (debian) and several others, which seem to work well
Feb 21 05:39:33 <lockywolf>	ayecee: good question. small size, no fan, rebooting itself after power is lost and restored
Feb 21 05:39:58 <ayecee>	lockywolf: ah. i guess that rules out desktop pcs in small formfactors.
Feb 21 05:40:06 <lockywolf>	espresso: is the usb inside of the chassis or outside?
Feb 21 05:40:08 <ayecee>	good description.
Feb 21 05:40:14 <mdogg>	That's where I was going with my thought process from the treadmill..
Feb 21 05:41:17 <espresso>	lockywolf: I use a 3.5" externally with cable spaghetti, but a modern pen drive could work as well
Feb 21 05:41:34 <ayecee>	mdogg: i think there's room for continuing education even in that role. but like a fraud prevention course you got a cert for 10 years ago with nothing since, would kinda show you're coasting.
Feb 21 05:41:38 <lockywolf>	I failed to get RPi4 to boot from a pen drive directly
Feb 21 05:41:42 <lockywolf>	not enough power, I guess
Feb 21 05:41:54 <mdogg>	ayecee: Got it - I see what you mean now.
Feb 21 05:41:55 <espresso>	ah yes, that can be an issue
Feb 21 05:42:10 <lockywolf>	I do boot it from a hub-powered drive
Feb 21 05:42:44 <mdogg>	My sister is a registered nurse and she has to re-certify every x years not just for her state license, but to remain in compliance with other regulations as well.
Feb 21 05:42:57 <Armand>	Pretty standard.
Feb 21 05:42:58 <solol>	I probably missed the conversation : NeXeN 22:51:23but i would be more worried about guest OS access to the FS.  Did you get anywhere from here?
Feb 21 05:43:07 <solol>	It was ~50 minutes ago.
Feb 21 05:43:09 <lockywolf>	mdogg: that is sah
Feb 21 05:43:11 <lockywolf>	sad
Feb 21 05:43:16 <mdogg>	What is?
Feb 21 05:43:17 <ayecee>	mdogg: could mean that you're not really interested in it, even where you're competent at it.
Feb 21 05:43:26 <Armand>	lockywolf: That's normal.... and *good*
Feb 21 05:43:27 <NeXeN>	solol: i've never tried it...had a buddy that used to do that
Feb 21 05:43:28 <solol>	wygtb now
Feb 21 05:43:36 <solol>	What was it?
Feb 21 05:43:40 <mdogg>	ayecee: I don't mean that.
Feb 21 05:43:45 <solol>	FS = File server?
Feb 21 05:43:51 <ayecee>	mdogg: no, i mean in my scenario, not yours
Feb 21 05:44:02 <NeXeN>	solol: years ago certain vm hypervisors could corrupt your fs if you let the guest OS access bare steel FS
Feb 21 05:44:11 <solol>	oic
Feb 21 05:44:21 <NeXeN>	I know it's probably not a problem now, but I'm oldschool....i worry about such things
Feb 21 05:44:29 <Armand>	NeXeN: To be fair, that would be deserved.
Feb 21 05:44:42 <NeXeN>	wsl is probably more dangerous than a guest OS accessing a FS
Feb 21 05:44:48 <Armand>	Yup
Feb 21 05:45:03 <solol>	wsl?
Feb 21 05:45:11 <ayecee>	mdogg: i.e. could mean the accountant is coasting.
Feb 21 05:45:13 <bparker>	asl?
Feb 21 05:45:19 <solol>	asl bparker u first
Feb 21 05:45:24 <bparker>	12/f/japan
Feb 21 05:45:25 <Armand>	Gates would be rolling in his grave if he saw WSL... lol
Feb 21 05:45:26 <solol>	-j/k/
Feb 21 05:45:37 <mdogg>	truth: ayecee brings up a very good point -- make sure that you really are interested in something before you decide to pursue a career in that field.  And there is nothing wrong with trying something and changing your mind and moving in a different direction.
Feb 21 05:45:37 <solol>	wyd in japan @ 12?
Feb 21 05:45:46 <bparker>	Armand: but unix services existed in NT

Feb 21 05:45:56 <solol>	u get a sweet costume still?
Feb 21 05:46:04 <solol>	no sms speak ok.
Feb 21 05:46:08 <ayecee>	thanks :)
Feb 21 05:46:11 <solol>	except sms is sms

Feb 21 05:46:31 *	solol Muahaha*
Feb 21 05:46:38 <solol>	haha
Feb 21 05:46:38 <Armand>	NeXeN: No, it was a joke. ;)
Feb 21 05:46:44 *	NeXeN phew
Feb 21 05:46:48 <Armand>	I was hoping for a better reaction. :P
Feb 21 05:46:55 <bparker>	why phew
Feb 21 05:47:04 <ayecee>	couldn't come up with one :(
Feb 21 05:47:17 *	solol winz again~
Feb 21 05:47:17 <Armand>	Gates is his sugar-daddy, bparker...
Feb 21 05:47:27 <Armand>	:P
Feb 21 05:47:45 <mdogg>	Imagine if someone decided that they were going to pursue a career as a peace officer because they know they could do the work physically and they like the starting pay, the pension, and the benefits.  Ideally, someone like that would be weeded out at some point during the selection process.  Or they wise up and quit themself.
Feb 21 05:47:54 <bparker>	must not be giving them much money if they need to stay alive
Feb 21 05:49:08 <ayecee>	bparker: reckon it would be a newsworthy event, and it would be dismaying to have not noticed it go by.
Feb 21 05:49:23 <Armand>	Stayin' Alive... Something the Bee-Gees have struggled with, ironically.
Feb 21 05:49:38 <ayecee>	nobody gets out alive.
Feb 21 05:49:46 <Armand>	Skindred!
Feb 21 05:49:55 <lockywolf>	is autossh in any way better than a plain bash loop?
Feb 21 05:49:58 <solol>	wHAT'S A peace officer?
Feb 21 05:50:01 <ayecee>	lockywolf: yup
Feb 21 05:50:06 <Armand>	solol: A lie.
Feb 21 05:50:07 <lockywolf>	ayecee: how?
Feb 21 05:50:10 <solol>	Does anybody even know what that is
Feb 21 05:50:22 <solol>	Is there even money to that job?
Feb 21 05:50:23 <ayecee>	lockywolf: i don't have a specific example onhand.
Feb 21 05:50:33 <solol>	most officers don't make money tho
Feb 21 05:50:43 <nullvalue>	no idea what it means
Feb 21 05:50:45 <solol>	j/k
Feb 21 05:51:19 <ayecee>	solol: look, if you have to label them, they're not good jokes.
Feb 21 05:51:31 <solol>	woopz
Feb 21 05:52:10 <lockywolf>	autossh had this monitoring port thing back in the day, but now it seems redundant
Feb 21 05:55:02 <ayecee>	i'd guess it has retry intervals, logging, and other stuff you _could_ do with a bash script but then you'd have to debug and maintain it yourself.
Feb 21 05:56:40 <lockywolf>	okay
Feb 21 05:57:31 <NeXeN>	I have a vision.
Feb 21 05:57:59 <ayecee>	how do you distinguish those from hallucinations
Feb 21 05:58:05 <NeXeN>	but i'm too drunk to articulate
Feb 21 05:58:13 <ayecee>	probably for the best
Feb 21 05:58:20 <NeXeN>	i just ask the chatbot and it'll tell me what is a hallucination
Feb 21 06:00:25 <nullvalue>	ayecee: XD good one
Feb 21 06:00:29 <lockywolf>	is thee something like a pstree+pgrep on one command?
Feb 21 06:00:46 <mdogg>	We have all encountered someone in our life who is unhappy (or even miserable) with their job.  On the other hand, there are people who have an abundance of passion for what they do and they can't wait to learn more and progress.   I went on a slight tangent so I'll pastebin that -> https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/606109c6d2a4
Feb 21 06:01:21 <nullvalue>	solol: every officer should be an advocate of peace, nuff  said
Feb 21 06:01:41 <ayecee>	hot take
Feb 21 06:02:12 <NeXeN>	mdg, wtf
Feb 21 06:02:31 <bparker>	lockywolf: autossh is worse, even more code to go wrong IMO
Feb 21 06:02:34 <nullvalue>	lockywolf: pstree && pgrep (pattern)??
Feb 21 06:02:53 <ayecee>	mdogg: it makes me think of this comic, the one that says "I'm only trained to do one thing, and if I'm not doing it... then what am I?" https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2012-09-02
Feb 21 06:02:54 <mdogg>	That last was really something I wanted truth to read, but again I was too late.
Feb 21 06:02:56 <nullvalue>	wait lemme check
Feb 21 06:03:03 <bparker>	I have always used bash loops
Feb 21 06:03:16 <NeXeN>	bash loops? wtf
Feb 21 06:03:23 <bparker>	with a sleep
Feb 21 06:03:26 <ayecee>	you just blew his mind
Feb 21 06:03:27 <solol>	nullvalue true

Feb 21 06:04:19 <mdogg>	Those are pretty funny, ayecee.  I'm gonna bookmark that.

Feb 21 06:05:51 <nullvalue>	solol you are just a rondom line that has been omitted in my buffers,lol

Feb 21 06:12:29 <Kaliroot>	 
Feb 21 06:13:16 <jasassin>	whoever invented the shutdown command first... why oh why did the next person change the command line syntax?  example: under BSD shutdown -p NOW  ... under LINUX shutdown -P now
Feb 21 06:13:21 <jasassin>	why?
Feb 21 06:13:49 <ayecee>	that must be very frustrating for you
Feb 21 06:14:00 <jasassin>	oh my God i'm so frustrated
Feb 21 06:14:04 <jasassin>	seriously!
Feb 21 06:14:09 *	jasassin growls
Feb 21 06:14:20 <ayecee>	i reckon the -p was a late addition. back in the day, computers couldn't power themselves off.
Feb 21 06:14:26 <jasassin>	frustrating (like the beerfest movie and the guy with the puppet)
Feb 21 06:14:41 <ayecee>	so that would have been added long after the shutdown command was first invented.
Feb 21 06:14:50 <nullvalue>	whay dont you just create an alias jasassin , it is possible "type whatever = 'runs command what ever"
Feb 21 06:15:03 <nullvalue>	simple as that
Feb 21 06:15:05 <Kaliroot>	Is halt command available of those system
Feb 21 06:15:10 <jasassin>	yeah yeah, but man wth
Feb 21 06:15:19 <nullvalue>	could be if you make it Kaliroot
Feb 21 06:15:20 <Random6>	I miss kali
Feb 21 06:15:26 <ayecee>	jasassin: so it's not something that was set one way and then changed later.
Feb 21 06:15:34 <bparker>	yikes
Feb 21 06:15:48 <jasassin>	what a buncha guys came up with -p -P at the same time?
Feb 21 06:15:49 <nullvalue>	i guess somethings are better left unchanged, is all
Feb 21 06:15:49 <Random6>	Kali had a fatal error the last time I installed it. Is that normal? First reboot upon updating kali led to a fatal error and wouldn't boot after that
Feb 21 06:15:51 <bparker>	jasassin: I prefer "poweroff"
Feb 21 06:15:57 <sem>	I did not know about -p how is it different from -h
Feb 21 06:16:01 <bparker>	and previously, halt
Feb 21 06:16:09 <Azin>	I'm using less -SFX to view mysql output, e.g. an entire table of columns and rows which I need to scroll horizontally. On the first output, before I start scrolling with the arrow keys, less displays the output without taking over the entire screen, but once I start to scroll, it clears the screen and goes fullscreen. Is there any way to force less to not take over the screen when I start scrollling?
Feb 21 06:16:10 <bparker>	why they changed THAT too I don't know
Feb 21 06:16:11 <ayecee>	jasassin: well at least two different people, sure
Feb 21 06:16:21 <jasassin>	ayecee: hahahahah
Feb 21 06:16:27 <jasassin>	pfffft
Feb 21 06:16:33 <jasassin>	i guess so
Feb 21 06:16:37 <bparker>	Azin: discover lnav, please
Feb 21 06:16:53 <jasassin>	either that or someone was vindictive
Feb 21 06:16:54 <Soweelj>	sysctl poweroff
Feb 21 06:16:57 <bparker>	or visidata
Feb 21 06:17:14 <Azin>	bparker: I'm on macOS. Anything native to that?
Feb 21 06:17:22 <bparker>	lnav or visidata
Feb 21 06:17:32 <jasassin>	doesn't macOS have shutdown in a terminal?
Feb 21 06:18:34 <ayecee>	does it?
Feb 21 06:18:40 <jasassin>	i wonder what the syntax is on that!?!
Feb 21 06:18:50 *	jasassin stalks off
Feb 21 06:19:26 <bparker>	it's shutdown -h now on osx
Feb 21 06:19:49 <nvz>	thats exactly what it is on linux :P
Feb 21 06:20:11 <ayecee>	sem: -h halts the cpu, -p powers off the computer using ACPI.
Feb 21 06:20:21 <bparker>	now it's "poweroff"
Feb 21 06:20:45 <NeXeN>	i like to use a hammer...just smash it to bits
Feb 21 06:20:47 <ayecee>	when shutdown is called as poweroff, it does the same as shutdown -p
Feb 21 06:20:48 <solol>	am i back on yet
Feb 21 06:20:48 <bparker>	man poweroff
Feb 21 06:20:51 <bparker>	no
Feb 21 06:20:52 <ayecee>	solol: yup
Feb 21 06:20:56 <solol>	alright
Feb 21 06:21:14 <Azin>	bparker: Thanks, I'll check those out. No way to "fix" less? It's so close to behaving nicely.
Feb 21 06:21:32 <mdogg>	I have two boxes that won't power-off if I just run 'sudo shutdown'.  They will go through the shutdown process and sit at "Reached Target Shutdown" until I press the power-off button.  So I got into the habit of always running 'sudo shutdown -P now' to shutdown and 'sudo shutdown -r now' to restart.  (Big P for power-off, btw)
Feb 21 06:21:39 <mdogg>	ayecee: ^
Feb 21 06:21:42 <bparker>	I don't think you can because it taking up more space on the screen is just what happens by default in terminals
Feb 21 06:21:54 <bparker>	you'd have to use something that is readline-aware to work differently
Feb 21 06:22:03 <bparker>	afaik
Feb 21 06:22:06 <ayecee>	mdogg: i think that's normal behavior for shutdown without -P, isn't it?
Feb 21 06:22:06 <hackinghorn>	why does "sudo shutdown" not work completely?
Feb 21 06:22:15 <bparker>	define completely
Feb 21 06:22:51 <Azin>	bparker: Alright, I was afraid there might be a limitation like that. Thank you for the help!
Feb 21 06:23:05 <nvz>	after all these years, I still don't know what systemd is :P
Feb 21 06:23:14 <mdogg>	Well, my other two boxes will power-off when I run 'sudo shutdown'.  That's why I got into the habit of running the whole command; I got tired of trying to remember which one does which, but ALL of them poweroff with 'shutdown -P now'.
Feb 21 06:23:28 <nvz>	if someone were to ask me what systemd is, I wouldn't have a good answer for them
Feb 21 06:23:30 <Azin>	nvz: http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd-for-admins-1.html ;)
Feb 21 06:23:42 <bparker>	also why does man shutdown list both a half AND a poweroff option, and imply that they somehow work differently but won't bother to tell you
Feb 21 06:23:48 <bparker>	halt*
Feb 21 06:23:57 <ayecee>	mdogg: ah. traditionally, shutdown on its own would bring you to single user mode.
Feb 21 06:24:04 <bparker>	nice nick
Feb 21 06:24:08 <mdogg>	Ohh, is that right?
Feb 21 06:24:19 <ayecee>	as runlevels aren't really a thing now, i guess that behavior had to change.
Feb 21 06:24:28 <nvz>	Azin: that calls it an init system, which isn't even remotely what systemd is
Feb 21 06:24:42 <mdogg>	So technically, the two boxes that wait at "reached target shutdown" are working the way shutdown was designed..  Interesting!
Feb 21 06:24:43 <bparker>	lol?
Feb 21 06:25:03 <ayecee>	mdogg: it's the way i remember it working back in the day when you had to power computers off manually.
Feb 21 06:25:26 <mdogg>	That makes sense.
Feb 21 06:25:28 <ayecee>	when the power switch disconnected the power with a satisfying clunk.
Feb 21 06:25:43 <mdogg>	The days of the rocker-switch for power.
Feb 21 06:25:43 <lkbjfdxjgf>	come up with an idea for a program
Feb 21 06:26:03 <mdogg>	Pre-ATX.
Feb 21 06:26:06 <ayecee>	the ones i used, it was a push button, but one with some weight to it.
Feb 21 06:26:30 <bparker>	aka AT
Feb 21 06:26:33 <mdogg>	Yeah
Feb 21 06:26:34 <bparker>	and before that, XT
Feb 21 06:26:48 <mdogg>	I'm just talking about an AT power supply.
Feb 21 06:26:51 <sem>	Growing up we had a Mac Plus and one of the games was Asteroids.... Which didn't have any way of exiting the game, so you just had to switch off the computer in the back
Feb 21 06:27:00 <nvz>	julie_pilgrim: howdy pilgrim
Feb 21 06:27:01 <mdogg>	Which was also on an XT.
Feb 21 06:27:07 <ayecee>	not a lot of linux on XT :D
Feb 21 06:28:08 <colemickens_irc>	I'm impressed at how iwctl manages to piss me off every single time I use it.
Feb 21 06:28:22 *	circuitbone looks for the turbo button...
Feb 21 06:28:28 <bparker>	isn't it deprecated
Feb 21 06:28:29 <sem>	Thanks ayecee , sounds like -p is the more power-saving option than -h assuming acpi supports it
Feb 21 06:28:36 <mdogg>	I think Khaytsus posted a screenshot of a scene from CLI Miami (or something like that) where the investigator used an AT power supply as a prop - something that he was trying to use to make it look like he was doing something technical.
Feb 21 06:29:10 <bparker>	you mean CSI Miami?
Feb 21 06:29:12 <lkbjfdxjgf>	I want to write a useful program on Linux. Come up with an idea.
Feb 21 06:29:15 <espresso>	nvz: we can tell them 'In brief, Systemd is an initialization and service management system with numerous parts and capabilities for Linux operating systems.'
Feb 21 06:29:27 <mdogg>	HAHA yes.. CSI..
Feb 21 06:29:45 <bparker>	CLI Miami would be a bit boring
Feb 21 06:29:45 <mdogg>	I should start a new Linux series:  CLI Miami
Feb 21 06:29:51 <sem>	Also why do APCI and APIC have to use the same letters....
Feb 21 06:29:58 <bparker>	ACPI*
Feb 21 06:30:03 <circuitbone>	That distro packs heat
Feb 21 06:30:09 <sem>	I can never get them in the right order
Feb 21 06:30:18 <bparker>	they should make it a palindrome
Feb 21 06:30:24 <bparker>	like tacocat or racecar
Feb 21 06:30:47 <sem>	Yeah that would be better.... ACPIIPCA
Feb 21 06:30:48 <ayecee>	sem: there's only 26 to choose from :(
Feb 21 06:31:10 <nvz>	espresso: whats with the single quotes? where is this from?
Feb 21 06:31:16 <sem>	That's a pretty good reason
Feb 21 06:31:31 <bparker>	people use single quotes all the time...
Feb 21 06:31:39 <mdogg>	You could try adding an umlaut over the 'P'.  =>
Feb 21 06:31:50 <bparker>	a what
Feb 21 06:31:59 <ayecee>	AN UMLAUT
Feb 21 06:32:02 <mdogg>	Two dots that make the vowel say it's name.
Feb 21 06:32:09 <sem>	Can emoji be passed to programs as commandline options
Feb 21 06:32:12 <bparker>	it makes it what?
Feb 21 06:32:16 <ayecee>	sem: i don't see why not
Feb 21 06:32:17 <bparker>	you lost me
Feb 21 06:32:24 <bparker>	sem: yes
Feb 21 06:32:54 <solol>	haha sem
Feb 21 06:32:56 <ayecee>	how else are you going to delete the file that you named eggplant-emoji
Feb 21 06:33:00 <mdogg>	Probably easier if you look it up.  It'll make sense then.
Feb 21 06:33:18 <sem>	I'm imagining 'apt-get -🐄'
Feb 21 06:33:22 <ayecee>	XD
Feb 21 06:33:32 <mdogg>	'sudo shutdown <eggplant> now' ?
Feb 21 06:33:40 <bparker>	just apt-get moo works fine
Feb 21 06:34:02 <sem>	rm -:boom:
Feb 21 06:34:09 <bparker>	that's not an emoji
Feb 21 06:34:27 <ayecee>	it can be if you use your imagination
Feb 21 06:34:30 <sem>	Keyboards are not good at emoji :(
Feb 21 06:34:34 <espresso>	nvz: one can substitute double-quotes :) just a description I used when someone asked before
Feb 21 06:34:57 <mdogg>	sem: I'm perfectly fine living in an non-emoji environment.
Feb 21 06:35:28 <bparker>	sem: ctrl-alt-shift-win+space
Feb 21 06:35:32 <nvz>	espresso: oh, well its a pretty good description I suppose, best I've heard... I have been at a loss for words to describe it
Feb 21 06:35:46 <ayecee>	"my father didn't use emoji, and his father didn't use emoji, and by gawd i'm not gonna be the one that breaks the chain"
Feb 21 06:36:05 <espresso>	nvz: hah, it is a bit amorphous
Feb 21 06:36:18 <nvz>	espresso: a bit?
Feb 21 06:36:24 <ayecee>	two bits
Feb 21 06:36:26 <sem>	mdogg: I'm ok with emoji but I don't like how files from Macs use different encodings from Linux when you type things like Mötörhead
Feb 21 06:36:41 <sem>	.mp3
Feb 21 06:37:06 <bparker>	fun fact mp3 is no longer patented
Feb 21 06:37:12 <sem>	:o
Feb 21 06:37:14 <nvz>	oh really?!
Feb 21 06:37:15 <ayecee>	a wild umlaut has appeared, and it brought a friend
Feb 21 06:37:21 <mdogg>	For one thing, I can't tell what 90% of them are just by looking at them.  That one up there looks like a Japanese paper doll.  Secondly, I think they detract from the standard text and are generally distracting.
Feb 21 06:37:30 <bparker>	since 2017
Feb 21 06:38:02 <mdogg>	Hey, an umlaut.
Feb 21 06:38:29 <sem>	I'm glad Ubuntu no longer has to pay a licensing fee to install it by default I suppose
Feb 21 06:38:31 <nvz>	mdogg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXzJR7K0wK0  is the future
Feb 21 06:38:35 <ayecee>	mdogg: i think it would be different for a native speaker, one who grew up using them.
Feb 21 06:38:40 <bparker>	I prefer kaomoji. ╰(*°▽°*)╯
Feb 21 06:38:55 <sem>	They are good :)
Feb 21 06:39:15 <mdogg>	ayecee: I know that to be true.
Feb 21 06:39:21 <sem>	d-_-b \m/
Feb 21 06:39:31 <mdogg>	However my sister uses them constantly and she's only a year younger than me.
Feb 21 06:39:51 <ayecee>	she's merely adopted them. the next generation will be the native speakers.
Feb 21 06:40:11 <mdogg>	There is a saying that a picture is worth a thousand words, but I also find the opposite to be true when it comes to emojis -- five words can be worth more than a picture.
Feb 21 06:40:34 <sem>	I like how the pictures look lol 🤣😆
Feb 21 06:40:47 <espresso>	^ what 'wild umlaut and friend' conjures. xD
Feb 21 06:41:05 <sem>	Yës
Feb 21 06:41:11 <ayecee>	words that have the same meaning often have several subtle additional meanings, and i think that'll be the case for emoji users.
Feb 21 06:41:29 <mdogg>	My sister uses those a lot.  Again, smiling faces are smiling faces to me.  My grin is => and my smile is =D
Feb 21 06:41:33 <ayecee>	sometimes an eggplant is just an eggplant.
Feb 21 06:41:43 <mdogg>	lol
Feb 21 06:41:52 <sem>	^=^

Feb 21 06:42:38 <sem>	(>'-')> kirby
Feb 21 06:42:45 <lkbjfdxjgf>	mdogg, I want to write a useful program on Linux. Come up with an idea.
Feb 21 06:43:45 <bparker>	lkbjfdxjgf: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/de4af7490417042c56190f28165f2417ae3e3a5a2fc5a137aeb92b60cb1e01f5/68747470733a2f2f696d6775722e636f6d2f4f5136423669722e706e67
Feb 21 06:43:49 <ayecee>	i imagine that in some groups, emoticons might be used to evoke the same sense as an old-timey drawl might in person.
Feb 21 06:46:10 <ayecee>	the future is a foreign country.
Feb 21 06:46:40 <solol>	u say what
Feb 21 06:46:47 <ayecee>	you, not u, please.
Feb 21 06:46:50 <solol>	why would anyone click on that link though
Feb 21 06:46:51 <ayecee>	kind of a thing here.
Feb 21 06:46:53 <espresso>	bparker: I could add 'distinct hues generator using the golden ratio'..
Feb 21 06:46:59 <sem>	Like 1337 5P34K
Feb 21 06:47:01 <solol>	don't f'ng click on that link, omghzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Feb 21 06:47:07 <solol>	haha
Feb 21 06:47:09 <solol>	ha
Feb 21 06:47:11 <solol>	ahahahaha
Feb 21 06:47:13 <mdogg>	lkbjfdxjgf: If you're looking for ideas, search for 'Linux' on github and from there you can narrow things down and look for projects that are in development and are requesting contributors.
Feb 21 06:47:51 <circuitbone>	mojo has an emoji extension. I lived past the due by date and saw the fall of code into disreptute.
Feb 21 06:48:01 <mdogg>	You can also use github to see an idea and then create your own project that may enhance something to which you can contribute directly, or create your own project using that as a model.
Feb 21 06:48:11 <Patrick_>	unlike ubuntu, debian's `apt show` output has a section called 'Tags'. Which man page covers this or where can I read about it?
Feb 21 06:48:11 <sem>	Links in libera have to be safe. It's the law™️
Feb 21 06:48:26 <bparker>	what is unsafe
Feb 21 06:48:41 <sem>	Nothing here that's for sure
Feb 21 06:48:41 <ayecee>	bparker: all those letters and numbers at the end looked scary.
Feb 21 06:49:06 <mdogg>	How did they get my hard drive's UUID?
Feb 21 06:49:15 <circuitbone>	lkbjfdxjgf:  Search the web for ideas never do any of those so you don't look like a clone during interviews.
Feb 21 06:49:17 <ayecee>	not so unique now, is it
Feb 21 06:49:36 <mdogg>	I thought I was ahead of the game by upgrading to UUIDv6.
Feb 21 06:49:53 <bparker>	I thought v8 was the new hotness
Feb 21 06:49:58 <espresso>	Patrick_: https://wiki.debian.org/Debtags ?
Feb 21 06:50:02 <mlu>	mdogg: haha, no, stick to uuidv4
Feb 21 06:50:07 <ayecee>	*smack* i coulda had a v8!
Feb 21 06:50:17 <mdogg>	I like V8.
Feb 21 06:50:22 <sem>	UUIDv0xFF
Feb 21 06:51:08 <Patrick_>	espresso: Thank you. I would have guessed that `man apt-cache`, and search for tags would have worked.
Feb 21 06:51:08 <sem>	∅xFF
Feb 21 06:51:25 <smelly_socks>	lkbjfdxjgf: better yet, just make meaningful contributions toward existing projects. nobody's going to hire you to start off building your own software all by yourself... they want someone who can close issues on their existing projects
Feb 21 06:51:35 <mdogg>	sem: That's annoying.
Feb 21 06:52:36 <sem>	That's rude
Feb 21 06:53:04 <ayecee>	that's amore
Feb 21 06:53:14 <sem>	:D
Feb 21 06:56:26 <ayecee>	Patrick_: it does have the text, "for the specific meaning of the remainder of the output it is best to consult the apt source code."
Feb 21 06:56:48 <ayecee>	really doesn't go into much detail on the output fields.
Feb 21 06:57:15 <Patrick_>	funny
Feb 21 06:57:38 <circuitbone>	smelly_socks for president
Feb 21 06:58:06 <ayecee>	not intended to be funny. just saying the manpage doesn't really describe the output.
Feb 21 07:12:45 <Patrick_>	`debtags search` doesn't seem to work
Feb 21 07:12:58 <Kaliroot>	Linux is missing alot, is there an in-built ai in any linux distro? There is no speech to text or text to speech or ai assistant.
Feb 21 07:15:00 <Patrick_>	Kaliroot: you will probably not find anything modern in that genre, but there is festival and espeak for text to speech
Feb 21 07:15:06 <ayecee>	seems a bit of a flamebait
Feb 21 07:15:23 <Patrick_>	eh, I lament this fact sometimes
Feb 21 07:15:45 <Patrick_>	kali makes me think of a noob, so it's believable
Feb 21 07:16:36 <Kaliroot>	So what is the dream of linux
Feb 21 07:17:02 <Patrick_>	but while we are on the topic, has there been any good open source speech to text or text to speech stuff released in the last few years?
Feb 21 07:17:13 <Patrick_>	I feel like there was and I never bothered with it
Feb 21 07:19:34 <Kaliroot>	Ok.
Feb 21 07:23:35 <CoJaBo>	Man. Our HTTP lib kinda sucks.
Feb 21 07:28:23 <louipc>	there's only 1?
Feb 21 07:28:48 <ppw>	is there a freedesktop channel?
Feb 21 07:31:43 <jasassin>	Google docs with voice typing from the tools menu.
Feb 21 07:32:36 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 21 07:32:37 *	litharge removes ban on $a:r1911
Feb 21 07:32:37 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 21 07:32:54 <jasassin>	text to speach? you could probably get one that sounds like Joshua from "War Games"
Feb 21 07:34:31 <nvz>	ppw: they were gonna have one, but they haven't worked out the standard for it yet
Feb 21 07:35:13 <nvz>	ppw: in all seriousness though, I believe its on irc.oftc.net
Feb 21 07:35:58 <ppw>	nvz: thanks (and lol)
Feb 21 07:36:17 <nvz>	ppw: did you know.. they don't lol in hawaii?
Feb 21 07:36:30 <jasassin>	nvz: nope, they lol
Feb 21 07:36:44 <nvz>	becase hawaii is a lo ha state

Feb 21 07:39:01 <r1911>	there was just some disease with penguins in antarctica. i think the news said about 200 mini-penguins died :(
Feb 21 07:39:15 <r1911>	let's have a moment on thoughts and prayers
Feb 21 07:39:19 <jasassin>	bob... he's a strange guy. ya know what's so weird about him....? he spells his name backwards
Feb 21 07:41:05 <nullvalue>	r1911: every day millions of people die,where is your bleeding heart for them -travolta, swordfish-
Feb 21 07:42:31 <r1911>	nullvalue: is that what's called a straw man argument?
Feb 21 07:43:14 <nullvalue>	im too lazy to even search or ask what that is....
Feb 21 07:43:17 <Disconsented>	That's not really a straw man
Feb 21 07:43:40 <r1911>	i'm still learning english
Feb 21 07:43:43 <nullvalue>	Disconsented: is it a real term, i thought r1911 is just making stuff up
Feb 21 07:43:53 <nullvalue>	me too r1911 always learning english
Feb 21 07:43:55 <r1911>	i'm always making stuff up
Feb 21 07:43:59 <Disconsented>	I know its a real term, I'm commenting on its use
Feb 21 07:44:07 <nullvalue>	aah, as i suspected
Feb 21 07:44:18 <r1911>	Disconsented: what's it called when somebody mentions something else than the other talked about?
Feb 21 07:44:38 <danza>	hijacking?
Feb 21 07:44:45 <Disconsented>	  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Feb 21 07:45:01 <r1911>	i need to consult wikipedia then
Feb 21 07:45:38 <nullvalue>	danza, conversation hijacking
Feb 21 07:45:40 <nullvalue>	XD
Feb 21 07:45:40 <danza>	a straw argument is an argument you make expecting it to be invalidated
Feb 21 07:45:41 <r1911>	"A straw man fallacy (sometimes written as strawman) is the informal fallacy of refuting an argument different from the one actually under discussion, while not recognizing or acknowledging the distinction.[1]"
Feb 21 07:46:13 <danza>	well i recalled wrong then
Feb 21 07:46:15 <r1911>	so many difficult words. damn you, brain
Feb 21 07:46:29 <nullvalue>	as Disconsented mentions thats not really a straw, man!!
Feb 21 07:48:51 <nullvalue>	wanna see a kangaroo fight a guy, its hilarious XD
Feb 21 07:52:22 <korn3r>	sounds dangerous. arent those might kill a man?
Feb 21 07:52:52 <nullvalue>	yeah but no one dies in it, well atleast not on camera

Feb 21 07:57:52 <peter-cauc>	use netstat or ss i found not many connections from 127.0.0.1:x to 127.0.0.1:9000 why connect has no resource to connect localhost:9000
Feb 21 07:58:03 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge

Feb 21 07:58:31 <peter-cauc>	i think maybe some progrom bind address-port, but not listen to it
Feb 21 07:58:44 <peter-cauc>	waste resource
Feb 21 07:59:04 <Random6>	Are SNES emulators in linux repository?

Feb 21 08:19:55 <mlu>	Random6: tehy technically acquired Blizzard early on
Feb 21 08:20:04 <lockywolf>	ayecee: about the time when we were locked up for covid quarantine
Feb 21 08:20:07 <nvz>	the /short/ overview of the crap I got laying around https://paste.debian.net/plainh/2dd09eab
Feb 21 08:20:21 <Random6>	I see that right now as I googled that's pretty amazing. He's part of history that's for sure
Feb 21 08:20:35 <Random6>	warcraft project too
Feb 21 08:20:51 <Random6>	Dungeon Masters....
Feb 21 08:21:04 <ski>	no, not D&D
Feb 21 08:21:06 <mlu>	Random6: you'd be surprised at how many conections happen between fraterntiy alumni
Feb 21 08:21:36 <mlu>	Random6: the acquisition probably started out as a random discussion during one of those convensions
Feb 21 08:22:06 <Random6>	Did you go to school with people in that generation?
Feb 21 08:22:21 <mlu>	Random6: I was too young, but the network is a powerful one
Feb 21 08:22:37 <Random6>	I can only imagine
Feb 21 08:22:46 <ski>	nvz : a lot of amstrad
Feb 21 08:22:47 <Random6>	Especially early on in game development
Feb 21 08:23:02 <mlu>	turn's out we're all just friends of friends :P
Feb 21 08:23:14 <luna>	had the Swedish localized version of Math blaster, Matteraketen Math rocket
Feb 21 08:23:28 <nvz>	ski: yeah idk what most of it even is, its just stuff I collected over time and haven't fooled with
Feb 21 08:24:00 <luna>	https://weenjoi.se/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8f691c0856cc5d04b0524b5955c16fb5.jpg
Feb 21 08:24:15 <nvz>	out of those nearly 40k games, I've probably played in my 40 years, maybe 100 of them or less
Feb 21 08:24:41 <Random6>	lol luna, you still have it?
Feb 21 08:24:55 <mlu>	main thing I heard was that educational software was a radical, controversial idea at the time
Feb 21 08:25:09 <ski>	"Math Rocket : The Lost City"
Feb 21 08:25:23 <mlu>	most people didn't have computers in the 90s
Feb 21 08:25:28 <korn3r>	luna: does this cd is even work now? i mean does it even reads?
Feb 21 08:25:32 <ski>	we did
Feb 21 08:25:36 <nvz>	the shit isn't even well organized and such.. it shows only 21 scummvm games, when really I probably have about 100 of them, but they're just not sorted right
Feb 21 08:25:45 <Random6>	Windows 95 or 3.1 haha
Feb 21 08:25:58 <mlu>	my first computer ran DOS
Feb 21 08:26:02 <luna>	korn3r: no idea don't still have it might still be at my grandparents place in another city but don't have it here
Feb 21 08:26:06 <mlu>	used some 286 system that my dad bought used
Feb 21 08:26:08 <korn3r>	nvz: dosbox "roms" looks funny
Feb 21 08:26:24 <Random6>	How was dos installed originally? Was it installed from floppies?
Feb 21 08:26:24 <mlu>	although by the time I actually had my own PC (instead of having to share the family one), I was 7
Feb 21 08:26:31 <ski>	our school had computers, with some simple programs for practicing works (plural forms, declensions, and so on), some math exercises, a simple text editor, and also Logo with Turtle Graphics
Feb 21 08:26:36 <mlu>	and then, that system ran Windows 95 :)
Feb 21 08:26:39 <nvz>	korn3r: well I just threw all the stuff together, some of that is windows games, some of it is dos games, some of it is stuff that'd run in scummvm.. etc
Feb 21 08:26:40 <korn3r>	luna: nice reason to visit grandparents :)
Feb 21 08:26:42 <mlu>	Random6: yup
Feb 21 08:26:46 <ski>	(only, the computers got stolen over easter ..)
Feb 21 08:26:47 <mlu>	Random6: several floppies :)
Feb 21 08:26:58 <Random6>	Interesting... I never got to see what came before dos
Feb 21 08:27:01 <luna>	korn3r: nah not super excited for old education games :p
Feb 21 08:27:04 <Random6>	It was always, just installed
Feb 21 08:27:07 <mlu>	Random6: PCs launched with DOS
Feb 21 08:27:19 <Random6>	ok
Feb 21 08:27:27 <korn3r>	luna: main idea was to visit grandparents... but ok :)
Feb 21 08:27:27 <mlu>	Random6: now, UNIX predates DOS by a lot
Feb 21 08:27:41 <Random6>	Really? How far back/
Feb 21 08:27:46 <korn3r>	like 30 years?
Feb 21 08:27:59 <Random6>	Wow
Feb 21 08:28:23 <Random6>	What about Macintosh?
Feb 21 08:28:25 <korn3r>	less than that. google says they startet at 1969
Feb 21 08:28:27 <mlu>	but yeah, IBM needed an OS for their 5051 PC -- they were originally gonna do CP/M but then Bill Gates sweeped in
Feb 21 08:28:37 <korn3r>	1969 unix that is
Feb 21 08:28:54 <nvz>	and screwed over both IBM and Seattle Computing, and made history
Feb 21 08:28:56 <nvz>	heh
Feb 21 08:28:57 <mlu>	Random6: the Mac OSes came after DOS, and were dead before DOS was dead
Feb 21 08:29:13 <mlu>	fun thing with operating systems; they're usually paired to some system architecture
Feb 21 08:29:35 <mlu>	and there isn'ty always a clear beginning/end -- there's always a lot of cross-influence, etc.
Feb 21 08:29:40 <mlu>	i.e. is Android really a Linux? :P
Feb 21 08:29:56 <mlu>	well, I'd say that Android is Linux as much as WinME is DOS
Feb 21 08:30:10 <Random6>	good points
Feb 21 08:30:14 <Kaliroot>	Yes
Feb 21 08:30:29 <korn3r>	winme was actually the last win that was basically gui over dos if i remember correcly
Feb 21 08:30:39 <nvz>	WinME was lovely, they took all the worst bits of Win98 like the uptime bug, and added in a nice memory leak and buncha other nice features
Feb 21 08:30:39 <korn3r>	although they blocked direct memory access in winme
Feb 21 08:30:40 <danza>	 /j #philosophy
Feb 21 08:31:01 <Random6>	lol nvz
Feb 21 08:31:12 <mlu>	nvz: I hated how they adjusted that ddefault gray into this weird beige
Feb 21 08:31:53 <mlu>	but yeah, UNIX stood the test of time -- it came first, and apparently, it grew and outlasted most stuff that came between
Feb 21 08:32:09 <Random6>	Wolfenstein 3D. I remember my Dad had to install episodes 2 - 6 with an .ARJ file. I couldn't figure that out until I was way older.
Feb 21 08:32:19 <ppw>	they didn't block dma in winme
Feb 21 08:32:22 <nvz>	I used to use that era of microsoft as explaination to people why Windows wasn't a good choice for most people.. that uptime bug was KNOWN and on their knowledge base as of Win95b which released with USB support and IE, and then what do they do, released Win98 and WinME with the same f'n bug..
Feb 21 08:32:23 <mlu>	and while DOS was available, you c ould also purchase OS/2 Wrap and Xenix
Feb 21 08:32:35 <nvz>	something that was probably a simple trivial 4 line fix any kid could do..
Feb 21 08:32:51 <korn3r>	ppw: there is even a patch for ME to have direct access to memory for dos apps
Feb 21 08:33:23 <korn3r>	unofficial one obviously
Feb 21 08:33:26 <Random6>	Could you dual boot early systems?
Feb 21 08:33:30 <ppw>	yes
Feb 21 08:33:35 <Random6>	cool
Feb 21 08:33:36 <mlu>	sure
Feb 21 08:33:45 <ppw>	they did cripple DOS mode in winme though
Feb 21 08:33:45 <nvz>	but by time ME came along, the uptime bug was of little importance because there wasn't a machine out there who could ever last long enough to hit the uptime bug, due to the f'n memory leak they introduced
Feb 21 08:33:47 <mlu>	you could boot as many boot partitions as you could handle
Feb 21 08:34:12 <nvz>	your machine would OOM before it could ever hit the uptime bug
Feb 21 08:34:26 *	mlu remembers when 512MB was a lot of RAM
Feb 21 08:34:36 <korn3r>	ppw: well.. patching io.sys could revert that crippling :)
Feb 21 08:34:38 *	nvz remembers when 1MB was a lot of RAM
Feb 21 08:34:50 *	nvz remembers having 20MB hdd
Feb 21 08:34:57 *	chessmaster remembers <1M being enough
Feb 21 08:35:05 <mlu>	Random6: ever been a one of those computer history museums?
Feb 21 08:35:09 <mlu>	Random6: when did you first use computers?
Feb 21 08:35:10 *	r1911 remembers when he had 38911 bytes free
Feb 21 08:35:17 *	ski . o O ( "Guldkorn Expressen" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pFxLdqN4Q> )
Feb 21 08:36:28 <nvz>	my first computer was so long ago I don't even remember a thing about it.. earliest computer I can remember is the TI 99/4a and Apple IIC, we apparently had an Atari PC before that but I don't remember it at all
Feb 21 08:36:47 <chessmaster>	at the grocer this girl at the counter had a name tag saying "Libera"
Feb 21 08:36:48 <mlu>	ooo, an Amiga :D
Feb 21 08:36:59 <vanessa>	Maybe this is off topic but anybody know how are URLs encoded?
Feb 21 08:37:00 <mlu>	chessmaster: did it have anything to do with the IRC network?
Feb 21 08:37:05 <mlu>	vanessa: for what purpose?
Feb 21 08:37:12 <chessmaster>	mlu: it was her name.
Feb 21 08:37:14 <mlu>	vanessa: there's many differnet ways URLs are encoded
Feb 21 08:37:30 <Random6>	I first used computers around 1991 - 1992
Feb 21 08:37:31 <mlu>	chessmaster: such a weird name :(
Feb 21 08:37:33 <nvz>	back in the day, downloading a game was getting a copy of apple magazine and sitting there for days punching in hexadecimal machine code, marking with pen in the book when you needed to take a break.. or going to the library with a fresh pack of floppies and copying their games
Feb 21 08:37:48 <ski>	r1911 : Razor ?
Feb 21 08:37:48 <Random6>	DOS and Windows 3.1. Wolfenstein 3D got me hooked lol
Feb 21 08:37:56 <Random6>	Yeah Chessmaster
Feb 21 08:38:09 <vanessa>	mlu: I am trying to add a search engine to my browser and I want to add to add `site:youtube.com` to the end of the query.

Feb 21 08:38:32 <vanessa>	I tried this and this is not working
Feb 21 08:38:33 <Random6>	Did you play that game a lot nullvalue?
Feb 21 08:38:37 <mlu>	vanessa: ah, ok -- you writing this in browser-side JS? there's some built-in functions for that
Feb 21 08:38:47 <nvz>	and to download a song, you had to take one of your old casettes you didn't really listen to anymore, chew up a piece of paper, stuff it in that little notch, shove it in your boom box, press rec+pause and wait for it to come on the radio and hurry up and unpause it
Feb 21 08:38:47 <nullvalue>	yes Random6 as a matter of fact i did
Feb 21 08:38:55 <Random6>	haha nice.

Feb 21 08:39:26 <nullvalue>	i also like the newer rendition of return to castle wolfenstein, tht game was lit
Feb 21 08:39:46 <mlu>	vanessa: most languages should have a standard lib for URL-encoding -- be careful to not accidentally double-encode :P
Feb 21 08:39:48 <nullvalue>	Random6: i think mine would be mortal kombat tht also until the 3rd of it
Feb 21 08:40:07 <nullvalue>	mk1 mk3 mk3
Feb 21 08:40:31 <Random6>	Awesome. Yeah those were good games too. I remember when mortal kombat 1 came out for snes, we changed the tint on the television to make the grey spray look like blood lol
Feb 21 08:40:48 <nullvalue>	heh
Feb 21 08:40:49 <mlu>	vanessa: but teh general idea is taht anything that's not alphanumeric gets percent-encoded, and depending on the encoding scheme, a space can either be %20 or +
Feb 21 08:40:53 <Random6>	Didn't like MK3?
Feb 21 08:41:01 <nullvalue>	oh i had a sega console
Feb 21 08:41:15 <nullvalue>	MK3 was ok'ish compared to later ones
Feb 21 08:41:16 <Random6>	awesome
Feb 21 08:41:28 <nvz>	nullvalue: you ever had sega channel?
Feb 21 08:41:43 <nullvalue>	no nvz i haven't
Feb 21 08:42:07 <nullvalue>	you mean a sega channel to distribute roms??
Feb 21 08:42:15 <nullvalue>	have seen some but not on this network tho
Feb 21 08:42:17 <nullvalue>	:P
Feb 21 08:42:18 <nvz>	sega channel, you got a modem cartridge that went into the genesis and hooked to your tv cable, and every month you'd have a list of games and you pick on it downloaded the rom and booted it
Feb 21 08:42:37 <nullvalue>	no nvz we didnt have those
Feb 21 08:42:45 <vanessa>	mlu, yes %20 thing added a space and it does what I wanted. thank you.
Feb 21 08:42:48 <Random6>	lol seriously nvz?
Feb 21 08:42:52 <nullvalue>	i had to get my cartridges from singapore back then

Feb 21 08:44:08 <nvz>	Random6: Mattel was actually the first to do it with Intellivision, but back then the cable companies didnt really have the infrastructure to make it successful
Feb 21 08:44:08 <nullvalue>	wow thts awsome
Feb 21 08:44:28 <nvz>	circuitbone: oh it was def a real thing, I had it.. heh

Feb 21 08:46:19 <Random6>	Was there anything prior to 48kbps internet?
Feb 21 08:46:26 <mlu>	vanessa: even though it might nto strictly be javascript, in practice, anything web-related tends to leak over and most people don't mind

Feb 21 08:49:53 <nvz>	Random6: it wasn't nearly as impressive as the idea of Mattel doing it on the Intellivision, they were just way ahead of their time.. the Intellivision was not only a very good system from a user standpoint, that is still in many ways never been matched or beaten, but at the tech level, it was dead simple, if you go look at the actual electronics that made up that machine and how it was done, it was pure
Feb 21 08:49:54 <r1911>	Random6: what? you do best with the tech you have
Feb 21 08:49:59 <nvz>	genius for being the early 80s
Feb 21 08:50:00 <circuitbone>	xterm, yterm or zterm, depending on your machine was the go.
Feb 21 08:50:33 <justanoobdevelop>	Hi guys. I need a WAF for integrating with kong API gateway. Our needs are detect and block dangerous traffic and log information to anywhere. Then we want to get report from this traffic. Whitch IP tried to attack and so one... What is best solution ?
Feb 21 08:50:59 <Random6>	lol true r1911. We had 56Kbps, which gave us about 3 - 5 KBps download.
Feb 21 08:51:11 <Random6>	waiting days for songs on napster
Feb 21 08:51:19 <nvz>	I was very excited for the idea of releasing a modern intellivision, but that project seems like it's never going to happen... I think COVID had a lot to do with it dying right before release.. the Intellivision Amico would've possibly brought the beauty of intellivision back to a whole new generation
Feb 21 08:51:25 <justanoobdevelop>	I think best solution is writing kong plugin and use a WAF library.
Feb 21 08:51:52 <Random6>	interesting nvz
Feb 21 08:51:59 <nullvalue>	Random6: i suspect you ever got 56k out of those modems back than, most was 32kbs and am talking US Robotics ones
Feb 21 08:52:09 <Random6>	lol
Feb 21 08:52:20 <Random6>	This was around 1997 - 1998 or so
Feb 21 08:52:25 <Random6>	Perhaps it had matured by then
Feb 21 08:52:34 <nullvalue>	those modems were the hype and lit
Feb 21 08:52:48 <korn3r>	also it was funny how software modem (which some ppl called Win modems) worked better under linux than under windows
Feb 21 08:53:04 <circuitbone>	oh win modems!
Feb 21 08:53:06 <Affliction>	If your phone lines were good quality, and you were close to the exchange, 56k was certainly possible
Feb 21 08:53:08 <Random6>	Was Linux sold in stores?
Feb 21 08:53:13 <Random6>	at that time?
Feb 21 08:53:13 <nullvalue>	naah 99 best effort 32kbps, maybe depends on the geographic reigion as well

Feb 21 08:55:21 <nvz>	oh it was horrible
Feb 21 08:55:29 <nullvalue>	bradd: treasure it!!!
Feb 21 08:55:35 <bradd>	yep :)
Feb 21 08:55:54 <nullvalue>	thts awsome you still have it
Feb 21 08:56:22 <bradd>	also openlinux, and c++ builder
Feb 21 08:56:23 <nvz>	I had tried corel and such after, and eventually settled on Mandrake for awhile.. but as I started to get teh hang of using linux, I realized using mandrake wasn't gonna get me anywhere.. they at the time were the ones doing all the polishing of GUI config tools, where no other distros had any such tools
Feb 21 08:56:28 <Random6>	What version of Red Hat are they on now?
Feb 21 08:56:31 <nullvalue>	i think mine was Redhat 6. something first experience with linux
Feb 21 08:56:42 <nvz>	Random6: there isn't a redhat anymore as such
Feb 21 08:56:47 <Random6>	ok
Feb 21 08:56:55 <nullvalue>	Random6: lost interest in redhat so dont knw
Feb 21 08:57:06 <circuitbone>	They tried to flog suse linux at one of the local computer stores as an alternative to windows 95 or 98, I forget.
Feb 21 08:57:08 <nvz>	Random6: now its either RHEL (RedHat Enterprise Linux) or Fedora
Feb 21 08:57:08 <Random6>	I remember corel was used in our schools
Feb 21 08:57:09 <nullvalue>	its RHEL
Feb 21 08:57:15 <nullvalue>	now
Feb 21 08:57:39 <nullvalue>	i <3 corel linux
Feb 21 08:57:51 <nullvalue>	also SuSe
Feb 21 08:58:20 <nvz>	I had after fooling with Mandrake messed with slackware, and almost became a die-hard slack user until one day I was on Distro Watch and I saw the Debian logo, the golden spiral, went to their site, which was even plainer than it is today..
Feb 21 08:58:40 <nvz>	I found on their website their Why Debian? and Social Contract documents, and I knew right then and there I was a debian user
Feb 21 08:58:55 <nvz>	I didn't even need to try it, I knew I found what I was lookin for
Feb 21 08:58:57 <nullvalue>	i remember when debian was first introduced
Feb 21 08:59:00 <nullvalue>	fun times
Feb 21 08:59:13 <ppw>	apt is magic
Feb 21 08:59:19 <Random6>	What could you do on early releases?
Feb 21 08:59:21 <nullvalue>	it was called potato i think
Feb 21 08:59:26 <Random6>	Was it like dos?
Feb 21 08:59:29 <circuitbone>	not much lol.
Feb 21 08:59:34 <nullvalue>	hehe
Feb 21 08:59:35 <nvz>	I didn't find it until around 2002ish, it was 2.2r6 I had downloaded and burned a 3 disk set, shortly after 3.0 Woody released
Feb 21 08:59:47 <nvz>	nullvalue: yeah 2.2 was potato
Feb 21 08:59:51 <Random6>	woody lol
Feb 21 09:00:05 <Random6>	lol funny names
Feb 21 09:00:09 <nullvalue>	yeah
Feb 21 09:00:12 <ppw>	never knew there were so many toy story characters
Feb 21 09:00:13 <nvz>	Random6: Debian releases are all named after Toy Story franchise chracters
Feb 21 09:00:23 <circuitbone>	My first distro `mklinux` trashed the drive ( scsi ) as the drivers had a show stopper. Installing it a couple of times was the exercise until a newsgroups reported it.
Feb 21 09:00:31 <korn3r>	Potato Linux - nice name for linux for (very) old PCs
Feb 21 09:00:34 <nullvalue>	yes nvz it totally was named after them
Feb 21 09:00:39 <Random6>	Interesting. I didn't know that. Was Debian used in the production of Toy Story?
Feb 21 09:00:53 <nullvalue>	not sure, have to check
Feb 21 09:01:06 <nvz>	Random6: no but one of the guy worked at Pixar or something IIRC,
Feb 21 09:01:08 <circuitbone>	It was SGI and irix in the early days, eventually linux took over.
Feb 21 09:01:34 <nullvalue>	there was one movie which was showing off alot of debain, i cant recall what it was tho, my memory is hazy
Feb 21 09:01:43 <circuitbone>	SGI octane, gosh. digital stiffy.
Feb 21 09:02:07 <bradd>	lol, I still have 2 octanes in storage
Feb 21 09:02:08 <Random6>	The drivers ruined your disk drives?
Feb 21 09:02:32 *	circuitbone pops over to bradd's place for a late night mission.
Feb 21 09:02:38 <nvz>	heh
Feb 21 09:02:42 <bradd>	lol! you cant find me!
Feb 21 09:02:47 <circuitbone>	dang
Feb 21 09:03:13 <nullvalue>	i would love to purchase copies of your collection bradd
Feb 21 09:03:25 <nullvalue>	for historical purposes
Feb 21 09:03:40 <bradd>	nah, i think i'll just keep em for nostalgic reasons
Feb 21 09:03:53 <nullvalue>	cool with that too
Feb 21 09:03:58 <nvz>	I'd still like to have an Apple IIgs, but they /still/ sell for like $500 or more.. and I ain't payin that kinda money for one :P
Feb 21 09:04:20 <circuitbone>	fire up Wizardry on that IIGS
Feb 21 09:04:53 <circuitbone>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry:_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord
Feb 21 09:05:00 <nvz>	the IIgs had what looked a bit like MacOS Finder GUI built in to the system on a rom
Feb 21 09:05:03 <nullvalue>	bbl
Feb 21 09:05:06 <nvz>	it was pretty slick
Feb 21 09:06:20 <Random6>	We had a Pentium 2, 233Mhz, with 8MB of ram, and 3GB HDD, that we upgraded with a Voodoo 3 2000 PCI video card, so we could play Indian Jones and Dark Forces 2. It was my favorite PC
Feb 21 09:06:29 <nvz>	if I had the time/money to properly nerd out, I'd have one and have it with some modern hw like ethernet card in it, and setup at the very least as a dumb terminal or something
Feb 21 09:09:17 <nvz>	Random6: one of my fav machines was Ambra 486, it was kinda a knockoff IBM machine, it was a desktop form factor had a hdd caddy that slid in under the PSU in the back, two 5.25 bays in front, 3.5in bay sideways next to it, the mobo had a video card daughter board that sat parallel to the board, then an ISA riser card for expansion ports, and like 8 simm slots iirc. I had one with an Intel Pentium Overdrive
Feb 21 09:09:23 <nvz>	chip in it which ran at 100Mhz
Feb 21 09:09:27 <Random6>	haha
Feb 21 09:09:39 <Random6>	Did it display the 100 Mhz on a display?
Feb 21 09:10:23 <circuitbone>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AMBRA_mouse_(closeup).jpg
Feb 21 09:10:32 <circuitbone>	Interesting position of the buttons
Feb 21 09:10:34 <r1911>	what does it mean when a television has 10-bit color? i use 24-bit on my laptop
Feb 21 09:11:20 <circuitbone>	It usually meant you were using a broadcast ready monitor for video as a computer screen. Sony was lord and saviour in that era.
Feb 21 09:11:52 <Random6>	for color ?
Feb 21 09:11:54 <nvz>	https://wiki.preterhuman.net/Ambra_486
Feb 21 09:12:53 <circuitbone>	https://www.ebay.com/b/Sony-CRT-Video-Monitors/21517/bn_160970
Feb 21 09:12:54 <nvz>	Random6: the Intel 80486 was a 33mhz CPU called the 486SX, then there was a 486DX which was 66mhz and much later came what was called Pentium Overdrive which was a 100Mhz cpu that fit the same socket
Feb 21 09:13:04 <Random6>	:
Feb 21 09:13:06 <Random6>	:)
Feb 21 09:13:19 <circuitbone>	I had the 486 dx 100
Feb 21 09:13:36 <Random6>	unreal
Feb 21 09:13:46 <circuitbone>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_DX4
Feb 21 09:14:00 <Random6>	Were these all different sockets?
Feb 21 09:14:39 <circuitbone>	socket wars was pentium I and onwards. Pentium II was a daughter card to the board at the time so even weirder.
Feb 21 09:14:50 <nvz>	circuitbone: yeah thats the one, the DX4 overdrive
Feb 21 09:14:58 <circuitbone>	yup loved that machine
Feb 21 09:15:18 <magga>	can you use 'sh ...' in a cronjob?
Feb 21 09:15:31 <magga>	or should i use 'source ...' its for running a .sh script
Feb 21 09:16:38 <nvz>	circuitbone: I had one in one of those ambra 486 machines, they were a cute lil form factor and I liked how you could access the hdd easily without opening the case.. had a caddy that slid out from under the PSU in the back, and a locking plate to secure it
Feb 21 09:17:16 <circuitbone>	nods
Feb 21 09:17:34 <nvz>	https://wiki.preterhuman.net/Ambra_486  and its actually the machine I had given to my dad's brother which he had used to meet his wife online if I recall correctly
Feb 21 09:17:49 <nvz>	course he died like 10 years ago now..
Feb 21 09:22:36 <nvz>	Random6: it was after the 486 the sockets began to change.. prior to that all 8086/8088 were the same, all 80286 (i286) were the same, all 80386 (i386) were the same, all 80486 (i486) were the same, then with the i586 and i686 is where things began to get complicated.. and AMD had all kinds of cpus in those early days that fit the same sockets as their contemprary intel counterparts.. and sometimes VIA or such
Feb 21 09:22:42 <nvz>	also made CPUs that fit the same sockets, then as time went on things diverged even more
Feb 21 09:23:08 <circuitbone>	yup
Feb 21 09:24:16 <nvz>	these days each company has their own line of sockets, it wasn't like that in the i586 days
Feb 21 09:24:37 <nvz>	an Intel 586 and an AMD k6 and such fit the same sockets
Feb 21 09:25:21 <nvz>	but really it was AMD that beat the race and gave us 64bit architecture
Feb 21 09:25:25 <r1911>	ski: there's no sailing the high seas on #linux
Feb 21 09:25:45 <circuitbone>	Pentium II and III were daughter cards no socket directly on the board.
Feb 21 09:26:35 <nvz>	yeah then P4 had re-emerged again later as a Socket 775 with hyper threading, was the same socket the Core2 processors used
Feb 21 09:27:08 <nvz>	that was the last desktop I built/owned was a Socket 775 P4, planning to move on to Core 2 later..
Feb 21 09:27:29 <nvz>	now I'm thinking of finally getting a desktop again..
Feb 21 09:27:57 <Random6>	I had a socket 939 AMD 3500+. My first ever cpu
Feb 21 09:28:01 <Random6>	Pc
Feb 21 09:28:14 <nvz>	modern AI and such has finally gotten me curious enough to fool with a desktop computer again and get off my 11 year old ultrabook class laptop
Feb 21 09:28:32 <Random6>	Then a socket 939 X2 4800+
Feb 21 09:29:05 <Random6>	What is inside your 11 year old ultrabook?
Feb 21 09:29:37 <nvz>	my cousin who buys and sells stuff he finds on auction recently traded a scooter he had for a computer identical to his, its a Dell G5-5000 w/ i7-10700F and Dell GTX 2060 Super 8GB, and I can get that for like $600 or less probably off him, which is kinda an offer I can't refuse
Feb 21 09:30:02 <nvz>	Random6: its a Lenovo Thinkpad T440 w/ i5-4300u, 8GB ram, 240GB m.2 ssd, 1TB hdd
Feb 21 09:30:02 <Random6>	Good deal
Feb 21 09:30:12 <nvz>	running Debian 12
Feb 21 09:30:27 <Random6>	^ That's still great for debian. :)
Feb 21 09:30:43 <Random6>	You have other thinkpads?
Feb 21 09:30:46 <nvz>	oh its an AMAZING machine.. thats why I've kept it this long
Feb 21 09:31:03 <nvz>	normally I get rid of stuff while it still has more value so I dont pay to upgrade
Feb 21 09:31:10 <Random6>	How did you find the little m.2 ssd for it?
Feb 21 09:31:46 <Random6>	I tried to find one for my x250's, T450s
Feb 21 09:31:58 <nvz>	I traded a college kid an IBM Thinkpad T42p (Pentium M 1.8Ghz, 1GB RAM, PATA HDD), for this T440 and he had retrofitted it with a 1080p screen and 3 button touchpad which werent options on this model.
Feb 21 09:32:18 <Random6>	Good deal!
Feb 21 09:32:29 <nvz>	Random6: they take a standard 42mm m.2 sata ssd.. they are easy to find.. you put em in the WWAN port
Feb 21 09:33:23 <Random6>	Is it a 14 inch screen?
Feb 21 09:33:57 <nvz>	Random6: the kid was a collector, was trying to like collect one of each model and max em out with latest tech and stuff.. I still felt like I was rippin him off even though he said he wanted that model bad cause his dad used to have one when he was younger.. so I gave him all the misc parts I had for old T61 and T500 and stuff also..
Feb 21 09:34:58 <Random6>	Do you collect them too?
Feb 21 09:35:07 <nvz>	Random6: the T440 is a 14in screen yes, 720p, buttonless clickpad, stock.. this kid had retrofitted it with the 3button touchpad and 1080p screen from the newer line
Feb 21 09:35:09 <circuitbone>	prior to the linux era, I ran a lot of unix bsd derivatives but the penguin pwned all those projects over time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MachTen
Feb 21 09:35:35 <Random6>	Nice find man
Feb 21 09:35:37 <nvz>	Random6: hell no, I grew up in a cluttered houshold I don't collect anything.. everything I own can fit into that honda accord outside :P
Feb 21 09:35:45 <Random6>	Lol
Feb 21 09:36:13 <Random6>	My T450s has a really poor monitor 1600x900 lol
Feb 21 09:36:19 <nvz>	I am 40, been using computers since I was knee high to a grasshopper, probably haven't spent even $2000 on computers in my whole life
Feb 21 09:36:19 <Random6>	Very low contrast
Feb 21 09:36:41 <Random6>	Sounds like you made a oo
Feb 21 09:36:45 <Random6>	Good choice
Feb 21 09:36:47 <nvz>	and I've had all kinds of crap, once had a big ass HP LaserJet 4si that could take two reams of paper with two input and two output trays, full duplex
Feb 21 09:37:28 <nvz>	you gotta get good quality stuff, take care of it, and get rid of it before its not worth anything
Feb 21 09:38:02 <nvz>	I waited a bit too long with this T440 but I could still probably get $300 out of it cause its not stock, and I got two ultradocks and two power cords
Feb 21 09:38:53 <Random6>	Are the docks for underneath?
Feb 21 09:38:57 <nvz>	I kept it so long because its got a good bit of oompf as far as being able to do most things, yet its very good on battery I've had times where I've gotten like 16-20hrs on a charge, and it doesn't get hot or anything like that
Feb 21 09:39:19 <nvz>	Random6: yeah they're real docks, not these octopus port replicator boxes they got now
Feb 21 09:39:35 <nvz>	Random6: this T440 is the last model to have an actual docking port on the bottom
Feb 21 09:39:52 <Random6>	Theyre zo c
Feb 21 09:40:01 <Random6>	SO compatible with linuc a
Feb 21 09:40:07 <Random6>	Linux and debia
Feb 21 09:40:34 <Random6>	I keep hitting enter prematurely
Feb 21 09:40:51 <Random6>	I got i7 5600u, Nd
Feb 21 09:40:51 <Scissors>	nvz: I don't sure if it fix my fan problem, but I just sudo apt remove  almost anything, and re-install only as small set of packages as posible....
Feb 21 09:41:05 <Random6>	And i5 5300u in two
Feb 21 09:41:32 <Scissors>	busybox uptime: ... up 15:42, ....
Feb 21 09:41:46 <Random6>	Perfect speexs for debian and linux i agree with you
Feb 21 09:42:37 <Random6>	nvz: Did you replace your batteries?
Feb 21 09:43:13 <Scissors>	nvz: what hardwarespecs you have now, at your thinkpad? and what was? are you debian/gnu  user?
Feb 21 09:43:56 <nvz>	Random6: no, theyre probably degraded about 75% of original capacity combined.. but the kid traded me with it having the extended life 72Wh removable plus the 24Wh internal.. so .. its still a LOT of power, and this machien uses very little even on wifi, I been using it all day long and the fan hasn't turned on once..
Feb 21 09:43:59 <multi8>	hp elite 840 g2
Feb 21 09:44:25 <Random6>	Cool nvz
Feb 21 09:44:28 <nvz>	Scissors: yeah its Debian 12, i5-4300u 8gb ram, 240G m.2 ssd, 1TB HDD
Feb 21 09:44:42 <Random6>	8gb is a good number tok
Feb 21 09:44:45 <Random6>	Too
Feb 21 09:45:04 <ski>	r1911 : had older brothers, who were in Fairlight, Horizon, Agile, &c.
Feb 21 09:45:33 <nvz>	the i5-4300 is capable of 16gb but these T440 and the X240 only have one sodimm slot and its max 8GB per channel, they have an option of 4GB soldered ram for a max of 12GB but personally I rather have 8GB than soldered ram
Feb 21 09:46:07 <Scissors>	nvz: how many cores/mh your cpu?
Feb 21 09:46:37 <Random6>	Can you find rare 16gb ddr3 sodimms?
Feb 21 09:46:48 <Random6>	Apparently they exist
Feb 21 09:46:54 <Scissors>	nvz: 64bit intel? (not arm, I suppose)?
Feb 21 09:47:07 <nvz>	I had an X240 also, but I had sold it to my cousin for $100 a while back then 6mo later after upgrading the ram and hdd, he wanted to get a new computer and I bought it back for $100, took the new HDD out he bought put it in my T440, put a 240G ssd in it, and sold it to a college student with one of my 3 docks I had at the time for $200
Feb 21 09:47:33 <nvz>	Scissors: the i5-4300u is an AMD64 2c 4t, w/ Intel HD 4400 iGPU
Feb 21 09:48:01 <Random6>	Intel cpu
Feb 21 09:48:01 <nvz>	Scissors: its a 1.9Ghz base clock with I believe a 2.9Ghz burst
Feb 21 09:48:37 <Scissors>	nvz: super!!and it use ... how many watts? by theway, how to see, how many watts my laptop use?
Feb 21 09:49:09 <Random6>	Did you prefer the x240?
Feb 21 09:49:13 <xiaomiao>	X270 idles at about 3-4W, display takes most
Feb 21 09:49:33 <xiaomiao>	also, wlan creates many interrupts/wakeups
Feb 21 09:49:37 <Random6>	What cpu in it xiaomiao
Feb 21 09:49:40 <xiaomiao>	with new batteries ~30h idle time
Feb 21 09:50:04 <xiaomiao>	Random6: I have one with i5-7300U CPU @ 2.60GHz, but there's a few different CPU options
Feb 21 09:50:05 <nvz>	Scissors: I just look in my power applet but you can also read that from the kernel in /proc/ or such.. it typically uses about 5-7W with normal usage doing stuff like IRC, web browsing, streaming, playing videos in vlc.. if you start doing stuff like running games in wine or doing google earth or such where its really doing somehting, the fan will turn on and it will use more like 10-15W
Feb 21 09:52:06 <nvz>	Scissors: thats the main reason I kept it so long, it draws so little power and has the ability to have 96Wh total at like a 5-7w draw.. thats a long battery life.. which is mostly because the little ultrabook processor doesnt heat up unless you're really sweating it with 3d or transcoding or such, and most all the time the fan is at 0rpm, long as your fan isn't running, your cores arent at 100%, and you're
Feb 21 09:52:12 <nvz>	backlight isn't at 100%, it uses very little power
Feb 21 09:52:35 <Scissors>	Anyone, where in /proc can I see power consumption?
Feb 21 09:53:02 <nvz>	the folk in #hardware accused me of trolling for saying this crap even after I took the damn thing apart and filmed a video on my phone of me on IRC with wifi on, and also playing video in VLC, and showing the fan wasn't spinning
Feb 21 09:53:11 <Scissors>	nvz: fantastical, your laptop use lower energy that seems possible...
Feb 21 09:57:04 <xiaomiao>	Scissors: newer notebooks are amazingly horrible
Feb 21 09:57:18 <xiaomiao>	I have a Lenovo T14s that I can't get under ~7.5W
Feb 21 09:57:26 <xiaomiao>	the GPU alone burns at a bright 2.5W!
Feb 21 09:57:38 <Scissors>	xiaomiao: they are more easily to damage occasionally, I mean, mechanically
Feb 21 09:57:41 <xiaomiao>	meanwhile, X270 runs at literally half that, with GPU at ~0.7W
Feb 21 09:58:01 <xiaomiao>	Scissors: yes that too ... I recently replaced parts on a T430 and was amazed how nice these devices are
Feb 21 09:58:19 <xiaomiao>	estimated an hour, took 15 minutes because it was so easy
Feb 21 09:58:26 <steering>	nvz: it's amazing how much power the backlight can use
Feb 21 09:58:26 <Scissors>	xiaomiao: probably you can "underclocking" your gpu?
Feb 21 09:58:48 <xiaomiao>	Scissors: but it's (supposed to be) idle ?!
Feb 21 09:58:56 <nvz>	steering: the backlight and fan use more power than most things
Feb 21 09:59:00 <steering>	i can't charge my laptop with one of my chargers if i have backlight on max, on min i can charge it in an hour or something
Feb 21 09:59:05 <Scissors>	xiaomiao: idle aloso can be underclocked
Feb 21 09:59:21 <Scissors>	steering: broken cable?
Feb 21 09:59:36 <steering>	crappy usb-c charger off amazon or something
Feb 21 09:59:45 <Scissors>	steering: there are possibility to decrease backlight
Feb 21 09:59:57 <steering>	supposed to be 65W but doesn't come close to matching the stock (lenovo proprietary charge connector) 65W brick
Feb 21 10:00:14 <steering>	Scissors: yeah, I just turned the backlight down when I needed to use that cable. These days I just use my Steam Deck charger instead. lol
Feb 21 10:00:19 <nullvalue>	me looks at lenovo brick and nods
Feb 21 10:00:36 <Scissors>	steering: depends on screen technology, just black screen maybe consume less energy, so, onen any blak webpage :)
Feb 21 10:00:54 <steering>	hah! no, i don't think it has any of that dynamic backlight fanciness or anything
Feb 21 10:01:06 <xiaomiao>	Scissors: on the X270 idle really means idle, new stuff is just weird
Feb 21 10:01:10 <lockywolf>	How can I build multistage docker builds sequentially?
Feb 21 10:01:13 <steering>	but fn+f5 or somewhere around there works well ;)
Feb 21 10:01:33 <xiaomiao>	extra fun: T14s has literally half the battery capacity of the X270, while burning twice as much power
Feb 21 10:01:44 <Scissors>	steering: wow! my fn+f5 also disable liht :)
Feb 21 10:01:53 <xiaomiao>	I would consider upgrading if an upgrade existed :\
Feb 21 10:02:31 <nvz>	Scissors: cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/power_now
Feb 21 10:02:41 <TuxJobs>	I have `MyCustomApplication*iconPixmap: /valid/path/to/a.xpm` in `~/.Xresources` and `xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources` has been run. When I open an XTerm with -class MyCustomApplication, it still gets the default XTerm icon in the top-left corner of the terminal's Plasma window. Other options such as `MyCustomApplication*faceName: Monospace` work, so it's not a case of the config not being read. The ".xpm"
Feb 21 10:02:43 <nvz>	Scissors: you have to be on battery power to see values there
Feb 21 10:02:46 <TuxJobs>	icon was created with `convert input.png a.xpm`. What is wrong?
Feb 21 10:02:59 *	steering glances at his UPS
Feb 21 10:03:14 <steering>	it would tell me i'm using ~150W but i need to warranty it :'D
Feb 21 10:03:14 <nvz>	Scissors: there is no straightforward way on most systems to know how much power a laptop is consuming when on AC
Feb 21 10:03:20 <Scissors_>	sorry, I tried Fn+f4, but accidentally press Alt+f4 :)
Feb 21 10:03:35 <steering>	oooooops!
Feb 21 10:03:43 <nvz>	Scissors: so when you're on battery power you can do cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/power_now  and see how much power its using
Feb 21 10:04:11 <suid_dumpable>	xiaomiao: i had an X230, until its display died. now i have a T490 and it doesn't seems as horrible as the T14.
Feb 21 10:04:48 <nvz>	Scissors: when I unplugged my system just now, one battery said 0 and the other said 5276000 which is 5.276 watts
Feb 21 10:06:09 <xiaomiao>	suid_dumpable: for me the X270 is the local optimum, newer stuff lacks connectors (ethernet, docking station) and has less battery range
Feb 21 10:06:48 <xiaomiao>	Scissors: 'powertop' might be useful for power-related investigations
Feb 21 10:06:59 <suid_dumpable>	xiaomiao: that's why i went from X to the T series. though it had to be the T490, not T490s. the latter has no rj45.
Feb 21 10:07:36 <nvz>	however that was with my backlight off entirely still sitting in the dock, with the backlight at full brightness it says 9288000
Feb 21 10:07:59 <nvz>	so the difference between backlight off and full bright is about 4w
Feb 21 10:08:15 <xiaomiao>	suid_dumpable: I like 'small' for mobile devices
Feb 21 10:08:28 <xiaomiao>	(which is why I hate modern smartphones, they require infrastructure to be mobile)
Feb 21 10:08:45 <suid_dumpable>	xiaomiao: well, 13" with full hd resolution is just too small for me (yeah, i am old :))
Feb 21 10:09:23 <xiaomiao>	suid_dumpable: that's why I have a 27" screen for the non-mobile situation
Feb 21 10:10:33 <Scissors_>	xiaomiao: System baseline power is estimated at 718 mW
Feb 21 10:10:50 <Scissors_>	xiaomiao: I assume it's wrong, or so
Feb 21 10:11:15 <Scissors_>	xiaomiao: by theway, by your nick, - I assume you are Chinese?
Feb 21 10:11:41 <xiaomiao>	Scissors: no, I'm not chinese
Feb 21 10:12:03 <nvz>	my backlight has settings from 0(off) to 841  and at even like 300 which is plenty viewable even in a lit room, its actually brighter than I need it to be, I'm only at 6.4W so its only using about 1W rather than the 3-4W it uses at full bright
Feb 21 10:12:10 <Disconsented>	xiaomiao> Apothecary?
Feb 21 10:12:25 <xiaomiao>	Disconsented: no, why do you ask?
Feb 21 10:13:02 <Scissors_>	Disconsented: diaries? :)
Feb 21 10:13:09 <Disconsented>	https://kusuriya.fandom.com/wiki/Maomao
Feb 21 10:13:12 <Disconsented>	Came to mind
Feb 21 10:13:21 <Disconsented>	"Nickname Xiao Mao"
Feb 21 10:16:18 <Scissors_>	3.12watt at max cpu usage... probably it doesn't see crrectly
Feb 21 10:16:42 <xiaomiao>	Scissors: yes that looks a bit off

Feb 21 10:46:35 <Scissors>	 both /sys/class/powercap and /sys/class_power_supply are empty folders; powertop and powerstat desn't see anything reasonable; :(
Feb 21 10:50:08 <Scissors>	Does laptop usually consume nax possibility from AC adapter?
Feb 21 10:50:10 <Scissors>	*max
Feb 21 10:52:11 <korn3r>	if battery is charging, then it should
Feb 21 10:52:44 <korn3r>	otherwise its current system power consumption
Feb 21 10:53:38 <lopid>	it seems like the news media all decided to drop "(formerly known as twitter)" this week
Feb 21 10:55:08 <Scissors>	I mean, does laptop usually consume 100% of AC possibility? or 20%? or 50%?
Feb 21 10:55:23 *	Scissors trying to aproximately calculate watts usage
Feb 21 10:55:54 <korn3r>	consumption depends on load
Feb 21 10:55:54 <lopid>	is it usually charging?
Feb 21 10:56:07 <Scissors>	no, it's without battery at all
Feb 21 10:56:58 <korn3r>	then its exactly what system currently requires, if its idle - consumption is low, if system is at 100%, consumption is probably much closer to 100% of what AC can give you
Feb 21 10:57:59 <lopid>	i doubt a laptop would consume anywhere near a wall outlet's maximum power
Feb 21 10:58:21 <korn3r>	i meant power adaptor, not wall obviously
Feb 21 10:59:04 <lopid>	i just saw "AC", but i didn't read the entire conversation before
Feb 21 10:59:21 <lopid>	the power adaptor provides DC
Feb 21 11:01:24 <korn3r>	ok, i wrote that one wrong. but anyway modern pcs do not consume much when they are idle. there is close to 0 chance that pc that doing nothing will consume maximum that DC can give. if it does, then it is doing something, really heavy load
Feb 21 11:02:34 <scottpedia>	korn3r: the charging of the batteries may be
Feb 21 11:02:36 <scottpedia>	?
Feb 21 11:02:56 <korn3r>	scottpedia: "<korn3r> if battery is charging, then it should"
Feb 21 11:03:06 <korn3r>	also guy said he has no battery at all
Feb 21 11:03:17 <scottpedia>	ohh okay sorry didn't read the logs
Feb 21 11:10:15 <korn3r>	and its probably not even "close to zero", its actually 0. if it consumes power, its either doing something, or there is some hardware malfunction like short circuit (wich usually leads to harware burning). because power consumed equals work done. well, almost equals, there is tiny overhead for hardware using some power for just being powered on, but thats not much
Feb 21 11:11:02 <mdogg>	What is it you are measuring?
Feb 21 11:11:33 <Scissors>	mdogg: power consumption of laptop;
Feb 21 11:11:47 <mdogg>	Ah
Feb 21 11:13:35 <korn3r>	also dont forget DC adapters are not 100% power efficient. so if your laprop or pc is using lets say 100wh, DC drains from the wall 100/0.9=110 (given its at 90% power efficiency)
Feb 21 11:14:53 *	Scissors assume, that, if laptop with battery can be powered by AC adapter, it's reasonable to assume that AC adapter can provide twice more energy that laptop is need; (for laptop + for battery charging); so, ne can divide AC power to 2 and expect approximately accurate higher border of laptop-without-battery consumption?
Feb 21 11:15:01 <r1911>	what can i do to reduce delays when i play my synth? the sound comes with a delay
Feb 21 11:15:16 <r1911>	i'm using ardour
Feb 21 11:15:33 <xiaomiao>	Scissors: that's not always valid - some high-power laptops can't charge and run at full speed at the same time
Feb 21 11:15:50 <xiaomiao>	but in general, the power supply is enough for battery charging and the rest of the system
Feb 21 11:16:02 <Scissors>	r1911: did you mean small random interraption? or you mean some delay, for software, to work with your synth?
Feb 21 11:16:16 <xiaomiao>	for smaller thinkpads it's roughly 30W charging peak, 25W system peak, 45W power supply
Feb 21 11:16:20 <r1911>	Scissors: i play my synth but the sound comes with a delay
Feb 21 11:16:31 <xiaomiao>	it'll charge slower if the rest of the system is using max power
Feb 21 11:17:01 <Scissors>	r1911: what delay? 50ms? 500ms? (approximately)
Feb 21 11:17:34 <r1911>	Scissors: i don't know how to measure it
Feb 21 11:17:50 <r1911>	Scissors: but it bothers me so that it's not ok
Feb 21 11:17:54 <Scissors>	xiaomiao: or such thinkpad, if system peak is 25wt, what is low/idle consumption?
Feb 21 11:18:20 <xiaomiao>	Scissors: about 3-4W, and peak 25W can only be sustained for a short burst
Feb 21 11:18:39 <xiaomiao>	iirc, cooling saturates around 15W
Feb 21 11:18:49 <mdogg>	The formula for calculating finding Power (Watt) is P=IV (current times voltage).  The only way to really do that is to use a clamp which can measure the current in a circuit uses without disconnecting anything - they look like little jumper cables.
Feb 21 11:19:02 <mdogg>	Or, you could get a device like this which will calculate the current, voltage, and phase angle automatically  -> https://www.amazon.com/Poniie-PN1500-Electricity-Electrical-Consumption/dp/B07VPTN8FZ
Feb 21 11:19:09 <Scissors>	r1911: try to run with sudo; it will increase priority and decrease delays; if software need not Xorg, disable Xorg completely; see "busybox top" if something use CPU;
Feb 21 11:19:26 <r1911>	Scissors: run ardour with sudo?
Feb 21 11:19:41 <r1911>	Scissors: i don't think that's wise
Feb 21 11:20:16 <mdogg>	Any other method would really be a very broad estimate of power consumption based on probable power usage by each individual component on the computer.
Feb 21 11:20:23 <Scissors>	r1911: sorry, I don't know what ardour is; I just give you generic advices, which may or may not be useful
Feb 21 11:20:31 <r1911>	Scissors: ardour is a daw
Feb 21 11:20:40 <r1911>	digital audio workstation
Feb 21 11:21:28 <Scissors>	xiaomiao: will AC adapter get from wall as wattsas written on it? Always? or only in max usage?
Feb 21 11:22:01 <xiaomiao>	Scissors: only on demand, their idle consumption is very low
Feb 21 11:22:05 <boc_th>	I don't think that should require root
Feb 21 11:22:31 <korn3r>	watts that written on it is how much it can provide to laptop, from it wall it gets that whatts divided by power efficiency
Feb 21 11:22:42 <r1911>	Scissors: i installed the lowlatency kernel and setup the limits for the audio group users
Feb 21 11:24:06 <boc_th>	Are you running ardour under that group?
Feb 21 11:24:17 <Scissors>	boc_th: r1911: use (re)nice instead; it's better; but usuallty, root have higher hardware priority than user
Feb 21 11:24:18 <r1911>	boc_th: yes i'm a member in that group
Feb 21 11:24:38 <mdogg>	Scissors: Let me see if 14A is average for these devices - not that you would typically need that but I'm curious now.
Feb 21 11:24:57 <r1911>	boc_th: do i have to make it my primary group?
Feb 21 11:25:16 <boc_th>	possibly
Feb 21 11:26:13 <Harm133>	Hey guys, I'm trying to setup a host to host bond, is this possible? (2 network interfaces connected directly host to host)
Feb 21 11:26:19 <boc_th>	Are you setting the higher priority too?
Feb 21 11:26:27 <korn3r>	r1911: is it just an app you run or does it have some service that is started? if latter one, you might want to check if that service is started under user that is also member of that group.
Feb 21 11:26:43 <boc_th>	just changing the limits won't do anything if the program doesn't try to renice itself
Feb 21 11:26:43 <nvz>	Scissors: a power supply is designed to provide a specific voltage, and adjusts its current to keep that consistent, as the load changes it changes its current to keep the voltage steady, so the watts/amps it says are just the MAX it can provide that particular voltage at, how much it uses depends on how much load there is on it
Feb 21 11:26:48 <r1911>	boc_th: yes in that /etc/security/limits.d/ config file
Feb 21 11:26:56 <Scissors>	Harm133: have ou/need you dhsp server?
Feb 21 11:27:15 <r1911>	korn3r: ardour is the audio program that i control through midi
Feb 21 11:27:26 <r1911>	korn3r: and ardour controls my synth
Feb 21 11:27:34 <mdogg>	Also, this comment is from someone who purchased it "Decimal point moves around, so 1.23 watts is displayed with 3 digits to the 100th watt -- with the leading zero blanked, 12.34 watts is displayed with 4 digits to the 100th watt, etc."  I would find that annoying.
Feb 21 11:28:22 <r1911>	boc_th: so i should start it with nice ?
Feb 21 11:28:39 <Harm133>	Scissors No,  I have 10.1.1.1 on the first bond, 10.1.1.2 on the 2nd
Feb 21 11:32:03 <boc_th>	you change nice and ionice in htop
Feb 21 11:32:22 <boc_th>	when you run htop as root; [ / ] to change nice, i to change ionice
Feb 21 11:33:04 <boc_th>	have you checked ardour configuration options?
Feb 21 11:33:24 <Fyr>	guys, how can I search files in Midnight Commander, like *.cpp and *.h?
Feb 21 11:33:31 <boc_th>	it possible that it can do it itself
Feb 21 11:34:32 <Fyr>	I know how to search for *.cpp, I know how to search *.h, I have no slightest idea how to search both.
Feb 21 11:35:20 <boc_th>	C-o and then find . -iname '*.cpp' -or '*.h'
Feb 21 11:35:45 <Fyr>	boc_th, I know find.
Feb 21 11:36:06 <Fyr>	I meant Find File dialog in Midnight Commander.
Feb 21 11:37:08 <nvz>	Fyr: just put both in the search
Feb 21 11:37:15 <nvz>	Fyr: space seperated I believe works
Feb 21 11:40:55 <nvz>	Fyr: ah no, its a | seperator
Feb 21 11:41:27 <Fyr>	Yes, it's the | separator.
Feb 21 11:41:49 <nvz>	thats something that always annoyed me about GUI like search tools, you never know what shit they use, some use , some use ; some use | some just use spaces.. heh
Feb 21 11:42:07 <Fyr>	Far uses comma
Feb 21 11:42:44 <nvz>	I've been using MATE a long time when I use a DE and I don't have the slightest clue what the mate search tool uses for that :P
Feb 21 11:43:02 <nvz>	yet I haven't been on windows in like 20 years and I can still remember how to do it on windows
Feb 21 11:45:22 <r1911>	boc_th: i'll try thanks
Feb 21 11:45:29 <r1911>	boc_th: do you create music?
Feb 21 11:46:44 <boc_th>	no, I was trying to set up noise supression or at least gating for my mic
Feb 21 11:47:32 <boc_th>	should be much easier now with pipewire
Feb 21 11:48:28 <nvz>	I don't think I'm on pipewire cause I was having an issue I thought it was causing, and I forced my system back to pulseaudio
Feb 21 11:48:38 <nvz>	never did figure out what was causing that problem
Feb 21 11:49:11 <mdogg>	Scissors: I'm purchasing this one right now.  The output is super easy to read/understand, it allows up to a maximum of 16A and will work with standard U.S. 60Hz voltages (110V-225V) and U.K./E.U. 50Hz voltages between 220V-240V.  It is rated to report up to 1800W (in the U.S.) and about 3000W in the U.K.  The second photo illustrates the output modes -> https://www.amazon.com/Poniie-PN2000-Electricity-Electrical-Consumption/dp/B0777H8MS8/
Feb 21 11:49:49 <Ooze>	Hi. I messed up and ran sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var instead of against the local var/ dir. I cancelled it pretty quickly, but it seems it still made some changes in /var. What can I do?
Feb 21 11:50:20 <nvz>	I could swear in previous years I could always use one app on one output and another on a different output and it stayed that way, but I was trying to do it now on Debian 12 and it kept changing which output apps used anytime like media changed in VLC or such it'd start outputting to whatever output was still being used by the other app rather than keeping it what I set it to
Feb 21 11:50:38 <nvz>	I thought maybe it was that pipewire causing the issue, but apparently not
Feb 21 11:51:04 <nvz>	Ooze: what distro are you using?
Feb 21 11:51:17 <Ooze>	Debian. No activity in that channel this early, though
Feb 21 11:52:14 <nvz>	Ooze: I'd imagine everything under /var should be root:root and 755
Feb 21 11:52:57 <jonusenet>	nvz, thats most, some problems may come up
Feb 21 11:53:00 <boc_th>	Ooze check the permissions against your backup and revert them where needed
Feb 21 11:53:14 <nvz>	Ooze: if you wanna be /certain/ thats why I'd need to know the distro because we'd have to examine the packages and fix the permissions with help of the package manager
Feb 21 11:53:15 <circuitbone>	or install debian into a vm  and compare
Feb 21 11:53:18 <Ooze>	backup? :) Sounds like I may have created a re-install situation
Feb 21 11:53:38 <mdogg>	Ooze: I'm not sure if this will help you or not, but all of the directories that I have in /var are 755 with the exception of the following two, which are 1777:   /var/mail and /var/tmp
Feb 21 11:54:27 <nvz>	yes there are a few exceptions in /var that have different permissions for mail, www, tmp, bittorrent things like transmission often default to this location..
Feb 21 11:54:53 <boc_th>	Ooze first check which files were wrongfully changed, that should be easy
Feb 21 11:55:03 <boc_th>	the hard part is figuring out what were the original permissions
Feb 21 11:55:07 <boc_th>	since you don't have backup to look
Feb 21 11:55:14 <mdogg>	Ooze: Oh, one note:  The directory containing my virtual machine data is not in /var - I have that under my root directory.
Feb 21 11:55:59 <nvz>	thats where you'd have to consult the package management system to know what the original permissions were
Feb 21 11:56:18 <mdogg>	What bittorrent data would be found in in /var?  I'm just curious.
Feb 21 11:56:36 <boc_th>	Ooze somehting like find /var -user www-data
Feb 21 11:57:08 <nvz>	something like this would work on debian: pkexec apt-get --reinstall install $(find /var -exec dpkg -S {} + 2> /dev/null | grep -v "no path found" | cut -d : -f 1 | sed 's/, /\n/g')
Feb 21 11:57:37 <boc_th>	nvz: dmpg has files in /var
Feb 21 11:57:42 <nvz>	would check files in /var against dpkg to figure out what packages they belong to, then pass those along to apt for reinstallation, fixing the permissions
Feb 21 11:57:42 <boc_th>	*dpkg
Feb 21 11:58:16 <nvz>	boc_th: yes, it does, thats where both apt and dpkg keep their cache files
Feb 21 11:58:41 <nvz>	things like post/pre install scripts, package cache, etc..
Feb 21 11:59:45 <Scissors>	nvz: have you site/blog? How long are you in gnu/linux stuff? 20 years?
Feb 21 12:00:12 <nvz>	Scissors: little more than 20 years and no, I don't have anything like that
Feb 21 12:00:51 <nvz>	Scissors: I used to be a highly active supported of debian but I'm now persona-non-grata :P
Feb 21 12:01:39 <nvz>	so I'm far more out of touch with the changes and issues users are facing than I used to be
Feb 21 12:02:03 <Scissors>	nvz: but what happens??
Feb 21 12:04:10 <nvz>	Scissors: not sure, nobody would talk about it. admittedly I can be verbose and talk a lot about my personal stuff, and I had just gone through some shit that had me in a bad headspace, but best I could tell it was related to something in an -offtopic channel and I woke up one morning and I was blanket banned from all debian namespace on both networks, and told not to use the wiki, or anything else @.@
Feb 21 12:04:45 <mdogg>	Scissors: There are similar products with backlights and stuff but in looking at them more closely they seem to try doing a lot of extra calculations that really are not necessary, in my opinion.  P.S., do /not/ get the one in that first link I sent.
Feb 21 12:04:52 <nvz>	Scissors: I don't even care at this point, far as I'm concerned they are the ones that are firmly in the wrong cause they violated the Social Contract in acting that way. if they had a problem, they should've said something to me first
Feb 21 12:04:52 <Scissors>	nvz: it's horrible shit O.o
Feb 21 12:05:21 <nvz>	the social contract clearly says they will not hide problems and that they will deal with things a certain way
Feb 21 12:06:32 <Ecko>	when doing  `login-ctl enable-linger <user>` it creates a file in /var/lib/systemd/linger/<user>.
Feb 21 12:06:32 <Ecko>	Is it enough to create that file as root? or do I specifically need to call the login-ctl command?
Feb 21 12:07:08 <Scissors>	^^ it's example o problem(s), that exist(s) in systemd spae only :)
Feb 21 12:07:53 <mdogg>	I'm happy to take on any issue related to systemd so long as I can continue to use systemd.
Feb 21 12:08:00 <nvz>	Scissors: mind you this all happened like 5 years ago now, perhaps more.. and I'm still the only one on their IRC banlists :P
Feb 21 12:08:24 <Scissors>	nvz: there was a problems in their side? if so, don't worry :)
Feb 21 12:08:26 <mdogg>	I'm banned in ##FlatEarth
Feb 21 12:08:36 <Scissors>	mdogg: why?
Feb 21 12:08:49 <mdogg>	I'm just kidding.  I've never been in that channel.
Feb 21 12:09:03 <Ooze>	Okay, I exported a 'find /var -user www:data' into a file. It doesn't look to be too bad https://dpaste.org/d6zwp
Feb 21 12:09:20 <mdogg>	LOL - someone just entered it.
Feb 21 12:09:30 <brutusmcforce>	yeah, i had to check
Feb 21 12:09:33 <brutusmcforce>	i'm sad it wasn't real
Feb 21 12:09:33 <mdogg>	LOL
Feb 21 12:09:40 <mdogg>	oh dear
Feb 21 12:09:53 <mdogg>	Ok, back to GNU/Linux
Feb 21 12:10:35 <nvz>	idk about anyone else but that goofy paste site won't load here
Feb 21 12:10:43 <mdogg>	brutusmcforce: You're the founder, now.  It can be as real as you imagine it to be.
Feb 21 12:10:56 <brutusmcforce>	i'm honored
Feb 21 12:10:59 <nvz>	Ooze: fwiw, one debian user to another... paste.debian.net is a no-nonsense pastebin
Feb 21 12:11:02 <mdogg>	Maybe I'm amazed.
Feb 21 12:11:39 <mattallmill>	Another Paul McCartney fan!
Feb 21 12:11:49 <boc_th>	corpo networks probably don't like these paste sites
Feb 21 12:11:50 <mdogg>	I created ##PhantomZone because I think it could be a really cool place, though I haven't done anything with it thus far.
Feb 21 12:12:02 <Ooze>	nvz: this was too large for their limit
Feb 21 12:12:13 <nullvalue>	##PhantomZone
Feb 21 12:12:15 <nvz>	Ooze: ah, well, yeah.. there is that..
Feb 21 12:12:34 <nvz>	Ooze: even termbin has limits
Feb 21 12:13:06 <Scissors>	there is no limits in /dev/null! expect speed :)
Feb 21 12:13:11 <nvz>	my 3 goto are paste.debian.net, termbin, and bpa.st which I use more for code cause I like the way it works for showing code and output and such
Feb 21 12:13:31 *	nvz redirects Scissors to /dev/null
Feb 21 12:13:38 <mdogg>	Speed is irrelevant in /dev/null
Feb 21 12:13:49 <nvz>	they've gone PLAID!
Feb 21 12:13:50 *	Scissors trying to run away rom /dev/null, but can't .... :(
Feb 21 12:14:25 <mdogg>	You have become pure energy.
Feb 21 12:14:38 <jonusenet>	if its a web server you can try the cloud, google cloud costs like 12$/mo if configured right, one time it cost me 80$. they have really advanced setups, and a trial. i setup a win10 server with remote win, Ooze
Feb 21 12:14:52 <Scissors>	Can pure energy run away from /dev/null? :)
Feb 21 12:15:34 <jonusenet>	basically you login with your gmail and you can ssh into a linux server running a distro you choose off their server
Feb 21 12:15:34 <nvz>	jonusenet: how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck chucked wood?
Feb 21 12:15:38 <mdogg>	I don't imagine pure energy has to run from anything.
Feb 21 12:15:57 <jonusenet>	lol nvz
Feb 21 12:16:11 <nvz>	jonusenet: I'm just trying to see if you're some kinda spambot.. :P
Feb 21 12:16:18 <nvz>	heh
Feb 21 12:16:49 <jonusenet>	no i dont work for google or get money from them lol
Feb 21 12:17:07 <nvz>	well not only did it seem like you were advertising, but it didn't seem relevant to anything
Feb 21 12:17:27 <jonusenet>	Ooze, is running a web server right?
Feb 21 12:17:47 <nvz>	all I know is ooze made a booboo with recursively setting permissions
Feb 21 12:18:06 <nvz>	don't see what that has to do with web servers and clouds
Feb 21 12:19:11 <jonusenet>	yeah, most i can help him with that is a vm with debian with a similar setup with a little script maybe with awk that reads the user and maybe permissions and writes it to a file, then you can move it to another computer. dont know awk too well, just got back into linux
Feb 21 12:19:27 <mdogg>	Scissors: In our universe, we have always tied energy to either mass or other particles., but now that you exist as pure energy you are tied to nothing and can exist within your own self.
Feb 21 12:19:34 <Ooze>	/var/lib/containerd/io.containerd is what's most concerning to me
Feb 21 12:19:36 <nvz>	I had already suggested a oneliner to check files against dpkg and reinstall any packages
Feb 21 12:19:37 <Scissors>	If busybox have the cat, why this cat never catch my mouse? I can't understand, why people pay for elecrticity if such cat is needed
Feb 21 12:19:57 <xenoan>	Waste my entire day for someone called "madaidan" (he's have a *personal* hate of Torvalds.). I've read his issues on github and realized he's so conservative about windows. "Security expert" Madaidan say insecure, but Kaspersky say secure. I * will *  trust Kaspersky more than unknown guy.
Feb 21 12:19:59 <Ooze>	It would be a pain to reinstall the whole system, but it's good practice anyway. I used to do it once a year and clean things up
Feb 21 12:20:35 <xenoan>	Type sudo password vs Yes/No  UAC prompt, we all know what is more secure.
Feb 21 12:21:24 <jonusenet>	basically i think with /var i think compiles check on those files through programs (anyone?), if they cant access it, you might not be able to compile certain software
Feb 21 12:21:43 <Scissors>	And, why cat never jumping out of busybox by it's own initiative?
Feb 21 12:21:45 <nvz>	this is why I tell people to use pkexec when I recommend stuff, cause its more modern and takes desktop linux into account.. and not only that, sudo isnt even installed by default on a debian system unless you don't set a rootpw in the installer, but pkexec is
Feb 21 12:22:12 <mdogg>	Ooze: It should be very simple to wipe the root and /swap partitions so long as /home has it's own partition someplace else.  I suggest backing /home up prior to modifying partitions, though.
Feb 21 12:23:00 <nvz>	you don't need to /wipe/ anything worst case you reinstall every package.. which is trivial and can be done online while still using the systm
Feb 21 12:23:01 <Ooze>	I'm using LVM. I think /home is on its own parttion
Feb 21 12:23:17 <Ooze>	nvz: Oh?
Feb 21 12:23:27 <jonusenet>	nvz, does that script idea work? could you write it for ooze? i think its ls -l | awk $1 $2 $3 > file then a script reading it and setting values
Feb 21 12:23:33 <nvz>	Ooze: did you also change permissions or just ownership?
Feb 21 12:23:50 <Ooze>	Just ownership. sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var
Feb 21 12:23:54 <scottpedia>	Ooze: lvm is magic
Feb 21 12:24:16 <nvz>	Ooze: just set it back to root:root then
Feb 21 12:24:25 <mdogg>	During the Linux install, specifically when the installer queries your block devices, you will be asked to provide the LUKS decryption password for /home (if it exists).  Then as you create the mount points for /efi/boot /root and /swap and set those to be formatted, you will click on the existing /home directory and opt not to format it, but to mount it as /home during boot.
Feb 21 12:24:48 <scottpedia>	you can't properly use linux without lvm set up mdogg
Feb 21 12:25:05 <mdogg>	Then when the installer gets to the part where it creates the first user account it will ask if you would like to import user data from an existing partition - say yes and select /home
Feb 21 12:25:28 <mdogg>	scottpedia: What do you mean by 'properly use Linux'?
Feb 21 12:25:31 <nvz>	Ooze: only things not owned by root in /var are like /var/www which /is/ www-data owned, and like /var/mail/ subdirs and such
Feb 21 12:25:33 <Ooze>	nvz: Not sure everything is root:root. I've seen some under wheel. I also heard that chown may even change perms
Feb 21 12:26:05 <scottpedia>	mdogg: i mean to use linux to the fullest
Feb 21 12:27:10 <mdogg>	scottpedia: Nothing says that you have to make @/home a logical volume under the root partition.  You can create a separate btrfs partition and create a logical volume for @/home there.  That way it's separate from root which is what I consider to be a best practice.
Feb 21 12:27:24 <nvz>	Ooze: https://termbin.com/9mat
Feb 21 12:28:08 <xenoan>	Tl; dr : Don't trust madaidan-insecurities. It's a FUD.
Feb 21 12:29:54 <louipc>	why's that
Feb 21 12:30:46 <nvz>	Ooze: there are two types of things in /var, those installed by packages, and those created by privleged access ..
Feb 21 12:31:13 <nvz>	Ooze: those installed by packages can be fixed using a one liner like the one I pasted earlier, to reinstall any packages with files in /var
Feb 21 12:31:15 <xenoan>	I don't know why Xen is random crashing when open just Firefox on domain 0 (yeah, I've allocated enough RAM for domain 0).
Feb 21 12:31:46 <nvz>	Ooze: those done by priv access won't fuckup the system much cause they're crap something made at runtime
Feb 21 12:33:16 <xenoan>	I want use Xen for para-virtualization (please don't recommend containers because I decided run them in Xen domain U.)
Feb 21 12:33:37 <nvz>	Ooze: and even if you did run the whole debian-installer again, all you do is just don't format the /home partition and/or don't format any partitions, make a list of installed packages (dpkg --set-selections > package.list) and then install all the same shit once you're back up and running
Feb 21 12:33:49 <Guest39>	Can anyone help me understand and set correct rights to gunicorn socket and service? I have user and group set to 'celery' user from which i start my celery... service and socket files placed in systemd/system with ln -s, so they are just links with root:root rights..
Feb 21 12:33:50 <Guest39>	Starting gunicorn service as root works fine, but that's not the way i want my services to work. Any ideas?
Feb 21 12:37:34 <Ooze>	Okay, thanks a lot nvz. Considering my options
Feb 21 12:38:10 <nvz>	Ooze: a bash guru may be able to offer you much better on-liners, they can be found in #bash
Feb 21 12:38:50 <nvz>	Ooze: but the general idea is what I showed earlier, just doing a dpkg -S on the files in /var and passing those to apt-get --reinstall install
Feb 21 12:39:36 <nvz>	pkexec apt-get --reinstall install $(find /var -exec dpkg -S {} + 2> /dev/null | grep -v "no path found" | cut -d : -f 1 | sed 's/, /\n/g')
Feb 21 12:39:42 <nvz>	was the half-assed thing I came up with
Feb 21 12:41:03 <nvz>	I'm pretty tired right now though, so I would take my ability to concoct a one-liner well lightly :P
Feb 21 12:41:49 <nvz>	the folks in #bash are much better at such things
Feb 21 12:42:25 <Ooze>	Okay. I also ran your one-liner by the folks in #debian before I commit to it
Feb 21 12:44:28 <nvz>	that one-liner would produce among other things a lot of duplicates and doesn't remove any duplicates, though I'd thinkg apt-get would be fine with that, and it also makes use of find and dpkg -S which would be a bit slow due to both searching the filesystem and querying the dpkg database
Feb 21 12:46:03 <nvz>	I also suspect the dpkg bot probably already has a factoid for this sort of thing
Feb 21 12:47:09 <nvz>	its certainly not a new problem, shit has always happened :P
Feb 21 14:01:41 <mort>	With /sys/class/gpio being deprecated, what's the intended way to read gpio from e.g a shell script?

Feb 21 14:09:48 <mort>	m$$$11?
Feb 21 14:11:07 <boc_th>	that's lack of proofreading

Feb 21 14:25:08 <gloomy>	Hi there, been asking on #archlinux but this is fairly generic and maybe someone here has more experience in this regard. Trying to troubleshoot an error from Kooha:
Feb 21 14:25:15 <gloomy>	    4: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod: No such interface “org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast” on object at path /org/freedesktop/portal/desktop
Feb 21 14:25:19 <louipc>	Foxboron: that's the clubs version of syntax error
Feb 21 14:25:49 <zanoh>	Portals might be most convoluted thing possible. They only work when they feel like it.
Feb 21 14:26:06 <gloomy>	What I found out so far (trying to learn a bit more about dbus along the way): I have apparently  two busses (org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop and org.freedesktop.impl.portal.desktop.kde) who *both* have an object path `/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop`, except only the one in `org.freedesktop.impl.portal.desktop.kde` has the `ScreenCast` interface
Feb 21 14:26:23 <FakuVe>	Hi , does anyone understand the following lines on man screen , for GNU screen? I am actually looking for modifying the cursor visibility , as I am having an issue with it
Feb 21 14:26:24 <gloomy>	zanoh: that's been exactly my experience so far :-)
Feb 21 14:26:46 <FakuVe>	       ESC Pn p                   Cursor Visibility (97801)
Feb 21 14:26:54 <FakuVe>	                                  Pn = 6                     Invisible
Feb 21 14:27:02 <FakuVe>	                                  Pn = 7                     Visible
Feb 21 14:27:26 <FakuVe>	What are the commands or actual keypresses to get my cursor visible?
Feb 21 14:27:31 <zanoh>	Pn... I'm assuing it's one of the F-x keys?
Feb 21 14:27:45 <boc_th>	gnu manpages are awful
Feb 21 14:27:46 <gloomy>	Question 1.: is it normal for two busses to have the same path? What is even a "bus"?
Feb 21 14:27:54 <boc_th>	try using info
Feb 21 14:27:58 <boc_th>	or just use tmux instead
Feb 21 14:28:02 <zanoh>	gloomy, bus means d-bus.
Feb 21 14:28:05 <FakuVe>	its then Esc + F7 + p ?
Feb 21 14:28:19 <FakuVe>	I am using tmux too
Feb 21 14:28:29 <zanoh>	The things I do to get thumbnails in my file picker.
Feb 21 14:28:35 <FakuVe>	lets solve this question , noone knows?
Feb 21 14:29:56 <zanoh>	GTK devs are extremely lazy. They're taking their sweet time to make it possible for GTK4 to auto generate thumbnails if missing.
Feb 21 14:30:06 <gloomy>	2. How do I proceed from here? :D screenshot of d-spy with the relevant info: 1. https://i.imgur.com/VriM0Af.png

Feb 21 15:01:35 <Atlas667>	Hi, all, hope you're all doing good. Just wanted to ask, is it possible to kill an HDD by interrupting a wipefs or mkfs? mine seems to have died :O
Feb 21 15:02:06 <ananke>	Atlas667: no
Feb 21 15:02:11 <rascul>	probably just need a mkfs to finish
Feb 21 15:02:14 <ski>	FakuVe : also see the `cnorm',`civis',`cvvis' terminfo capabilities (try e.g. `infocmp -1 screen | grep -e vis -e norm')
Feb 21 15:02:34 <ananke>	Atlas667: when you say 'have died', what are the actual symptoms? got any system logs?
Feb 21 15:05:09 <Atlas667>	thanks, : Fsck wont run no matter what, mkfs will sometimes finish, the device will be mountable, but then disconnect after i try to actually put data into it. Ill post some logs.
Feb 21 15:07:01 <rascul>	sounds possibly like a potential issue with the drive that probably isn't related to wipefs or mkfs, dmesg and smartctl should provide more info
Feb 21 15:07:32 <rascul>	could also be useful to know what error message you got from mkfs when it didn't succedd
Feb 21 15:08:41 <boc_th>	try to recreate partition table too
Feb 21 15:10:40 <ananke>	Atlas667: check 'dmesg' and 'journalctl'. sounds like the device may be dying. no, it would not be caused by some aborted write from wipefs nor mkfs
Feb 21 15:11:18 <Atlas667>	This is just for today, its on an ARM sbc right now, but ive tried on my main system and even wiping on windows
Feb 21 15:11:19 <Atlas667>	I canceled the first wipefs because of how long it would take 8TB 3 passes and then tried to rebuild the filesystem.
Feb 21 15:11:19 <Atlas667>	MKFS will finish without error messages, but the device will be unusable and even claim hardware issues.

Feb 21 15:14:30 <carpenter>	yt-dlp  wants to install to ~/.local/bin/yt-dlp but that folder doesn't exist what heck are they thinking?
Feb 21 15:14:56 <carpenter>	and where should I install it instead?
Feb 21 15:15:52 <xx>	crete that directory?
Feb 21 15:16:17 <Atlas667_1>	I have not tried to encrypt, seeing as everything else fails i woudlnt want to waste my time doing large operations on the drive
Feb 21 15:16:47 <rascul>	Siecje no, it's for file/directory encryption
Feb 21 15:17:04 <xx>	Atlas667_1: drives die
Feb 21 15:17:27 <xx>	you can try some ATA SECURE ERASE to restore some pending stuff, maybe it will still work afterwards
Feb 21 15:17:30 <xx>	but I'd never trust it
Feb 21 15:17:31 <Siecje>	rascul: Can I do it with any of these? https://github.com/raspberrypi/cmprovision/issues/39#issuecomment-1928087983
Feb 21 15:17:32 <rascul>	Atlas667_1 smartctl -a /dev/sda
Feb 21 15:17:51 <rascul>	Siecje i'm not sure what you're asking
Feb 21 15:18:14 <Siecje>	How to encrypt an existing disk partition.
Feb 21 15:18:51 <rascul>	i think cryptsetup has something for that which may or may not result in data loss
Feb 21 15:19:19 <carpenter>	https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation
Feb 21 15:19:27 <carpenter>	someone please tell me how to install it
Feb 21 15:19:52 <rascul>	carpenter download the binary and put it somewhere in $PATH
Feb 21 15:20:07 <rascul>	exactly how it is shown in the link
Feb 21 15:20:25 <rascul>	possibly exactly
Feb 21 15:20:45 <Atlas667_1>	rascul
Feb 21 15:20:45 <Atlas667_1>	https://paste.linux.chat/?3d9cdcb220a9e65e#78v7ndws2epnhzaQtStCCEZboMQ9ha1yBVVvuyXcH6ZE
Feb 21 15:20:46 <Atlas667_1>	There are some sort of smartctl error concerning this specific drive (Seagate) and ARM, which I've read can lead to many smartctl errors. But the drive had been working fine as backup for years and only when i went to wipe did it become a brick of sorts.
Feb 21 15:20:52 <carpenter>	rascul, not sure what you mean
Feb 21 15:21:19 <rascul>	carpenter what part of the instructions you linked to do you have issue with?
Feb 21 15:21:44 <rascul>	Atlas667_1 the drive has probably not been working fine and you didn't notice it
Feb 21 15:23:07 <boc_th>	unless you regularly scrub the drive, it's easy to not notice
Feb 21 15:23:09 <ananke>	Atlas667_1: from your previous errors, looks like the device was on its last leg
Feb 21 15:23:10 <carpenter>	rascul, I get an errormessage because the output directory doesn't exist
Feb 21 15:23:34 <rascul>	carpenter create it and add it to $PATH or put it in a directory already in $PATH
Feb 21 15:24:12 <boc_th>	shit like this is why you should use a hashing filesystem and schedule a scrub every few weeks
Feb 21 15:24:48 <ananke>	smartctl exists, if one just pays attention.
Feb 21 15:25:08 <boc_th>	it's certainly better than nothing, but isn't always reliable
Feb 21 15:25:39 <ananke>	most distros run smartd as a service, and many systems have an actual bios setting 'report smart issues', which would notify you at boot
Feb 21 15:25:42 <suid_dumpable>	the bad thing about SMART is there are so many vendor specific values
Feb 21 15:26:34 <ananke>	the issue at hand was identified by SMART, this isn't some hypothetical scenario with unknown vendor codes
Feb 21 15:26:40 <treatmenice>	has anyone ever installed linux on a lenovo laptop
Feb 21 15:26:57 <ananke>	treatmenice: you're going to have to be more specific than that
Feb 21 15:27:01 <r1911>	no one ever has i think
Feb 21 15:27:07 <Atlas667_1>	Aye, aye. Thanks all, I must accept the drives fate.
Feb 21 15:27:41 <treatmenice>	anake: to be more specific ill say a lenovo ideapad flex 5
Feb 21 15:27:47 <boc_th>	at least you didn't loose any data, presumably
Feb 21 15:28:26 <boc_th>	treatmenice: disable secure boot and all that stuff, boot from usb drive
Feb 21 15:28:38 <rascul>	treatmenice are you having an issue with it?
Feb 21 15:28:49 <boc_th>	that's basically how it works everywhere nowadays
Feb 21 15:28:54 <rascul>	most mainstream distros can handle secure boot fine, no need to disable it
Feb 21 15:28:57 <Atlas667_1>	treatmenice
Feb 21 15:28:57 <Atlas667_1>	Im on linux on a x1
Feb 21 15:30:19 <suid_dumpable>	lenovo ideapads tend to have el-cheapo components like realtek wifi. i'd prefer thinkpads.
Feb 21 15:30:26 <treatmenice>	no just asking because i might install linux in the future and even if i did have issues then i wouldnt be in a irc chat of all placces
Feb 21 15:30:39 <r1911>	he just said he has an idepad
Feb 21 15:31:10 <r1911>	i have an asus laptop from 2017 and kubuntu sat on it just like that
Feb 21 15:31:25 <carpenter>	rascul, how do I add a dirctory to $PATH ?
Feb 21 15:31:25 <treatmenice>	suid_dumpable: i was on a budget at the time so i couldnt splurge on a new laptop and its fine in windows anyway
Feb 21 15:33:06 <rascul>	put something like this in ~/.bash_profile :     PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
Feb 21 15:33:45 <rascul>	if you're not using bash then it's a different file
Feb 21 15:33:51 <Atlas667_1>	The pc they gave me at work is an ideapad 7 slim pro and it's never flinched. Although they wont let me put linux on it
Feb 21 15:35:11 <suid_dumpable>	treatmenice: just saying. if it has realtek wifi, be prepared to have some issues. some realtek wifi chipsets are okay, others like the one used by the rtw_8723de driver are horrible.
Feb 21 15:35:54 *	kfrench secretly replaces suid_dumpable's rtw with bcm.  Let's watch and see what happens.
Feb 21 15:35:54 <treatmenice>	suid_dumpable: do you expect problems with the wifi
Feb 21 15:36:55 <suid_dumpable>	kfrench: broadcom, oh yeah. hate it.
Feb 21 15:37:26 <suid_dumpable>	14:35 < treatmenice> suid_dumpable: do you expect problems with the wifi .... lost connection
Feb 21 15:42:03 <Lantizia|Work>	Hey... you know a long while back we all switched from eth0,1,2,etc... to enp3s0,enp4s0,etc...
Feb 21 15:42:30 <Lantizia|Work>	I just took a graphics card out of a machine and all the interfaces went down by 1 (i.e. an interface that was enp6s0 was renamed enp5s0)
Feb 21 15:42:32 <r1911>	Lantizia|Work: i didn't: net.ifnames=0
Feb 21 15:42:45 <Lantizia|Work>	isn't all this stuff meant to prevent such renamed?
Feb 21 15:42:47 <Lantizia|Work>	*renames?
Feb 21 15:42:50 <kfrench>	r1911: +1
Feb 21 15:43:03 <r1911>	strange generalisation
Feb 21 15:43:22 <r1911>	Lantizia|Work: it's predictable of course
Feb 21 15:43:29 <Lantizia|Work>	lol not in this case
Feb 21 15:43:33 <r1911>	Lantizia|Work: you just didn't expect it
Feb 21 15:43:55 <r1911>	Lantizia|Work: a sysadmin from work told me about that
Feb 21 15:44:00 <Lantizia|Work>	my only thinking is it's counting pci-e slots from the "beginning"... but the "beginning" has changed (as a motherboard/bios level) without the gpu inserted
Feb 21 15:44:04 <xx>	Lantizia|Work: you could use names based on MAC addresses instead
Feb 21 15:44:31 <Lantizia|Work>	true, but it's a horrible default if it doesn't work 100% of the time
Feb 21 15:44:52 <rascul>	systemd.net-naming-scheme(7)
Feb 21 15:45:33 <rascul>	it works 100% of the time but you don't understand how it reaches the results so you can't predict it
Feb 21 15:45:40 <rascul>	there's only like 2 people who actually know how it works
Feb 21 15:45:43 <suid_dumpable>	Lantizia|Work: quite surprising. i have never seens PCI slot numbers change for the remaining cards if one PCI card is removed.
Feb 21 15:46:25 <boc_th>	this is why filesystems use uuid
Feb 21 15:46:49 <suid_dumpable>	boc_th: yeah, but NICs aren't block devices :)
Feb 21 15:46:53 <rascul>	theoretically you should be able to determine the interface name by looking at lspci (if it's on the pci bus)
Feb 21 15:47:03 <kfrench>	rascul: net.ifnames=0, created bond0, add eth0 and eth1 to the bond, use dhcp, sleep soundly.
Feb 21 15:47:29 <rascul>	kfrench yep i can't even pronounce en0ps3 or whatever but i can pronounce eth0 just fine
Feb 21 15:47:32 <boc_th>	the logic is the same, you want to uniquely identify the physical thing
Feb 21 15:48:50 <boc_th>	but it does make sense that you'd want to swap a faulty one and have it work ootb
Feb 21 15:49:37 <Lantizia|Work>	rascul, well i suspect the nic that was on 06:00.0 (as shown on lspci) is now the nic on 05:00.0
Feb 21 15:49:58 <Lantizia|Work>	which goes to show the removal of the gpu has somehow rejigged how the board/bios reports the pci locations to the OS
Feb 21 15:50:14 <Lantizia|Work>	which means this new naming convention is kind of predicated on that not happening
Feb 21 15:50:34 <Lantizia|Work>	well "new" - it isn't new, not by any means
Feb 21 15:52:11 <rascul>	there, you've showed that the name can be predicted by looking at lspci
Feb 21 15:52:29 <rascul>	if the numbers reported by lspci change that's not the fault of the interface naming scheme
Feb 21 15:53:08 <Lantizia|Work>	sure but having a scheme based on such information, when that information isn't a reliable indication of any actual change in where the hardware is plugged in... is :)
Feb 21 15:53:14 <rascul>	i don't find this naming scheme particularly useful so i make the change that has been mentioned twice
Feb 21 15:53:21 <Lantizia|Work>	I know I know
Feb 21 15:53:42 <Lantizia|Work>	it's just surprising and irritating and I thought I'd rant
Feb 21 15:55:51 <suid_dumpable>	the whole idea of naming NICs after their location on the PCI bus was to have stable names even when NICs are added/removed. but if the PCI bus enumarates *existing* slots if one card is removed then the whole thing is pointless.
Feb 21 15:56:05 <Lantizia|Work>	right!
Feb 21 15:56:27 <hodapp>	whatever, I lived through devfs so everything looks cleaner tome
Feb 21 15:57:11 <suid_dumpable>	hodapp: well, NICs have no /dev entry anyway
Feb 21 15:57:23 <hodapp>	screw this, I'm using plan 9
Feb 21 15:57:32 <suid_dumpable>	:]
Feb 21 15:57:47 <hodapp>	if I wanted a filesystem this useless, I'd use an iPad
Feb 21 15:59:03 <suid_dumpable>	hodapp: does plan 9 really have its NICs in /dev? can you do "cat /dev/eth0" and it's a poor man's tcdpdump?
Feb 21 16:01:01 <kfrench>	echo 192.168.1.50 >>/dev/eth0/ip4
Feb 21 16:03:44 <boc_th>	cat can't intercept what other processes are reading/wrinting from/to file
Feb 21 16:04:08 <boc_th>	you've invented.... netcat
Feb 21 16:04:18 <boc_th>	oh wait
Feb 21 16:05:25 <Lantizia|Work>	kfrench, what about multiple ip's and matching them with their subnets? :D
Feb 21 16:05:37 <kfrench>	Lantizia|Work: That's why I used >>
Feb 21 16:05:59 <kfrench>	probably should have included the netmask in the IP.  /shrug
Feb 21 16:06:19 <kfrench>	I've never used/seen Plan9.  I'm from Earth.
Feb 21 16:06:47 <Guest9>	me joining a channel. first post is bs about plan9 not beeing in prod
Feb 21 16:07:13 <kfrench>	Guest9: You're a file
Feb 21 16:07:29 <Guest9>	everyhting is a file.
Feb 21 16:07:38 <Guest9>	thats the whole point, right?
Feb 21 16:09:36 <Guest9>	kfrench but for real plan 9 is widely used in nokia, ericsons and all the other western SP-grade appliances.
Feb 21 16:09:51 <kfrench>	What's a SP?
Feb 21 16:10:06 <Guest9>	service providers.
Feb 21 16:10:17 <Guest9>	cellular, energy, networks
Feb 21 16:10:24 <kfrench>	aah
Feb 21 16:10:33 <Guest9>	if you ever move the big stuff be sure to bring your plan9 cheatsheet
Feb 21 16:10:51 <kfrench>	I have that in a file somewhere
Feb 21 16:10:59 <hodapp>	you have any other information on the use of Plan 9 there? I was only familiar with things like Inferno
Feb 21 16:11:07 <hodapp>	articles or case studies or whatever
Feb 21 16:12:10 <tesseract>	guys, is it possible to record "journalctl -b 0" as text to inspect later?
Feb 21 16:12:22 <Guest9>	not really just experience. mostly these vendors don't tell you whats on their machines. their update cycles are few in a decade and mostly this stuff operates without interaction from installation to replacement
Feb 21 16:12:58 <kfrench>	tesseract: $ModLoad imjournal with rsyslogd?
Feb 21 16:13:39 <hodapp>	e.g. I had thought Ericsson famously ran on Erlang which I didn't think even ran on Plan 9
Feb 21 16:14:13 <tesseract>	kfrench: its ok. using journalctl -b 0 > record.log works
Feb 21 16:15:22 <Guest9>	hodapp i know that ericson has solaris and linux. i thought there was plan9 aswell. i might be mistaken. this was back in 00s
Feb 21 16:15:52 <Guest9>	but cellular controllers are where i first ever encountered plan9
Feb 21 16:16:12 <Guest9>	and the senior technician told me that its the most common OS after solaris.
Feb 21 16:16:33 <kfrench>	In the 00's, sure.
Feb 21 16:17:05 <TuxJobs>	What a missed opportunity of the Audacious developers to not make it possible to bind a key to "go to next playlist" -- only "go to next track in current playlist". I almost never want to do the latter, but the former is something I frequently need, but now have to open the program and manually click on the next playlist to continue on it.
Feb 21 16:18:31 <Guest9>	kfrench as if the controllers for radio communications for gas/oilpipelines have been changed since then.
Feb 21 16:18:33 <TuxJobs>	I frequently encounter such situations, where the developer of some program fails to take into consideration something that would be very easy for them to add (because they already have done the basic work for other things), and they just seem to... not use their own software?
Feb 21 16:18:57 <Guest9>	i saw stuff from the 70s in operation.
Feb 21 16:19:50 <Guest9>	TuxJobs whats your definition of next playlist. next file in the dir you started the current one from?
Feb 21 16:20:15 <boc_th>	You don't understand, you're just using it wrong!
Feb 21 16:21:10 <TuxJobs>	Guest9: Literally "the next playlist", as in, the "playlist" tab that is right to the one currently focused/playing.
Feb 21 16:24:27 <Guest9>	TuxJobs so you have playlists inside of the specific player, not represented t=by actual playlist files?
Feb 21 16:30:35 <Siecje>	I'm trying to customize this build. I'm getting "c-stack.c:55:26: error: missing binary operator before token "("" More output https://dpaste.org/19Zex

Feb 21 16:53:45 <locutus_>	i have an imx8 board that only has a single PCIe lane that is connected to an FPGA. That FPGA has like 8 different peripherals on it that in a sane world would each have their own pcie bus with a pcie switch and a device driver. I have made independent pcie drivers that all work when mounted alone, but the bus (understandably) wont letme mount multiple of them at once since theyre using the same pcie bus
Feb 21 16:53:52 <locutus_>	anyone have any advice other than building one horrific monolithic device driver that switches between all the peripherals?
Feb 21 16:55:01 <Scissors>	locutus_: kernel boot parametre: pci=bios
Feb 21 16:55:17 <MinusOne_>	locutus_: I would say this is the problem that PCIe bifurcation is meant to solve, but throwing the FPGA in the middle of things makes me scratch my head
Feb 21 16:55:31 <MinusOne_>	oh lol you said one lane, not one slot. nevermind
Feb 21 16:55:44 <akk>	c
Feb 21 16:55:46 <Scissors>	locutus_: see kernel documentation, about pci=.... ; I'm not sure, anyway, if your bios see your crazy hardware stuff.....
Feb 21 16:57:14 <bombastick>	was GPT4 nerfed again? I asked "I want to search all branches of a git repo for a filename that contains the word "compile" in the filename (not the content). I also know it has a .sh extension." and both attempts gave wrong answers. (What I wouldn't give to access the GPT4 from immediately after launch, before Big NGO got their tentacles on it...)_
Feb 21 16:57:56 <Scissors>	locutus_: probably you need also "acpi=off ";
Feb 21 16:58:33 <locutus_>	So if I were to enable those what would that achieve? I could load multiple kos each trying to register pci on the same bus?
Feb 21 16:58:47 <locutus_>	Looking at the kernel-parameters page the pci=bios description doesnt tell me much
Feb 21 16:59:59 <Scissors>	locutus_: it *maybe* disable requirements to use .ko at all; but *only* if bios completely works with shit hardware on it's own;
Feb 21 17:00:56 <TuxJobs>	Guest9: I assume that they are represented by files stored somewhere, but yet, they are inside Audacious. I don't understand why you think I mean something else.
Feb 21 17:01:20 <MinusOne_>	I wonder if you could somehow design a driver that acts like a usb controller and exposes the peripherals over usb
Feb 21 17:01:41 <TuxJobs>	xx: A keybind? I can make keys run a command, but Audacious has no command-line parameter to "play next playlist", and no such thing can be set from KDE multimedia global hotkeys.
Feb 21 17:01:53 <MinusOne_>	I have zero experience working with FPGAs so I don't know what kinda stuff you can realistically make it do
Feb 21 17:02:16 <locutus_>	hardware looks like,
Feb 21 17:02:30 <Guest9>	because my mediaplayer is a headless server that plays paths i present. so opening a dir of playlist file with it results in the next command resulting in the next file aka. playlist beeing opened
Feb 21 17:02:34 <locutus_>	                             |-axi-> periph 1
Feb 21 17:02:35 <locutus_>	procesor -pcie-> | fpga -|
Feb 21 17:02:37 <locutus_>	                             |-axi-> periph 2

Feb 21 17:02:51 <locutus_>	pcie goes to a bunch of different axi buses to the peripherals
Feb 21 17:02:58 <locutus_>	formatting got fucked up there
Feb 21 17:03:04 <MinusOne_>	locutus_: you may get auto kicked for spamming if you paste too many lines =P
Feb 21 17:03:08 <MinusOne_>	pastebin is your friend
Feb 21 17:03:12 <Khaytsus>	locutus_: Chill on the language and the random pastes.
Feb 21 17:03:13 <locutus_>	thanks
Feb 21 17:03:32 <locutus_>	apologies.
Feb 21 17:03:57 <Scissors>	locutus_: also, there probably exist gnu/linux driver about your hardware; just see "sudo lspci -vv " and try to find gnu/linux driver by code, such as "ABCD:0000"
Feb 21 17:05:05 <suid_dumpable>	locutus_: there is this wonderful thing called termbin. just pipe your text output to  nc termbin.com 9999
Feb 21 17:05:24 <Scissors>	locutus_: personally at my opinion.... it seems to be nice idea, to write script, which will automatically load/unload .ko, by see , what you wanna to do in current moment; or, by "hotkeys".....
Feb 21 17:05:42 <locutus_>	I mean I have no problem bringing up the pcie, the problem is that I am using it in a non standard way. unfortunately I have no alternative at the moment. the only feasible thing ive found is to register the pcie in the __init function then in the probe load all the different drivers.
Feb 21 17:05:56 <locutus_>	@Scissors yeah thats another alternative ive been looking at, super messy but possible
Feb 21 17:06:09 <locutus_>	im currently writing all the drivers independently so I can do just that.
Feb 21 17:06:39 <locutus_>	bus contention is a nightmare too, as well as handling the interrupts since multiple of the devices have interrupts so i would need like a global isr
Feb 21 17:08:07 <Scissors>	locutus_: there was (a lot of) kernel parametres, about interrupts; I can't remember them, but you can open their doc and search by "IRQ"
Feb 21 17:08:30 <Scissors>	locutus_: same page as about parametre pci=.....
Feb 21 17:11:32 <Scissors>	locutus_: probably see source code of "main" (or of all used .ko-files), and disable/comment line which forbids to use them simultaneously? /* my opinion: it's risky, it may almost certainly "freeze" your OS...)
Feb 21 17:11:37 <Scissors>	*/
Feb 21 17:13:19 <locutus_>	Scissors: hah, I may do that just to to see how the system responds. Id be worried the multiple modules would just be stepping on each other trying to access the bus
Feb 21 17:34:11 <locutus_>	Scissors: someone just informed of MFDs which I haven't heard of and this looks to be the canonical answer to this issue
Feb 21 18:04:49 <TuxJobs>	XTerm problem: I have `MyCustomApplication*iconPixmap: /valid/path/to/a.xpm` in `~/.Xresources` and `xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources` has been run. When I open an XTerm with -class MyCustomApplication, it still gets the default XTerm icon in the top-left corner of the terminal's Plasma window. Other options such as `MyCustomApplication*faceName: Monospace` work, so it's not a case of the config not being read. The ".xpm" icon was created with `convert input.png

Feb 21 18:18:00 <raja>	Hello, I am trying to understand below line from dwm config.
Feb 21 18:20:29 <raja>	``` { 0, XF86XK_AudioMute,        spawn, {.v = mute_vol } },
Feb 21 18:20:29 <raja>	       { 0, XF86XK_AudioLowerVolume, spawn, {.v = down_vol } },
Feb 21 18:20:29 <raja>	       { 0, XF86XK_AudioRaiseVolume, spawn, {.v = up_vol } },
Feb 21 18:20:56 <brjl>	which one :þ
Feb 21 18:20:59 <raja>	is there any keybinding already mapped to these lines ?
Feb 21 18:21:13 <uwharrie>	there are 3 keybindings mapped to those lines
Feb 21 18:21:15 <raja>	{ 0, XF86XK_AudioMute,        spawn, {.v = mute_vol } },
Feb 21 18:21:34 <brjl>	As X is concerneed,  XF86XK_AudioMute is a key present on your keyboard
Feb 21 18:21:35 <raja>	how can Interpret them, could you you please ?
Feb 21 18:22:26 <uwharrie>	XF86XK_* are keysyms that have been bound to call a function... AudioMute calls mute_vol, AudioLowerVolume calls down_vol, etc etc
Feb 21 18:23:33 <raja>	Oh got it, the multimedia keys on my keyboard
Feb 21 18:23:35 <raja>	Thank you.
Feb 21 18:42:50 <donofrio>	superkuh, yep is it lxc
Feb 21 19:20:31 <zzzzzzzzz>	hi i have issue with wireguard, tough dont think its issue with wireguard cuz it works i can ping  vpsPC(10.0.0.1) i can ping homePC(10.0.0.2)  10.0.0.0/24 is my wieguard network, but vpsPC-publicIP packets that enter there wont route to 10.0.0.2,
Feb 21 19:20:35 <zzzzzzzzz>	PostUp = iptables -i eth0 -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 9999 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.2:9999 PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; PostUp = iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
Feb 21 19:21:38 <Khaytsus>	If eth0 really your interface?
Feb 21 19:21:51 <Khaytsus>	Because it probably isn't on most distros for many yeras
Feb 21 19:22:18 <zzzzzzzzz>	2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000     link/ether b2:26:2e:c7:56:a6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff     altname enp0s18
Feb 21 19:22:50 <zzzzzzzzz>	ip adrr , so i guess it is
Feb 21 19:23:09 <zzzzzzzzz>	should i use altname?
Feb 21 19:23:19 <Khaytsus>	And that is your WAN?  And you have enabled basic routing etc?
Feb 21 19:23:23 <korn3r>	also you can forcefully return eth* naming to any distro afaik
Feb 21 19:23:33 <Khaytsus>	korn3r: I realize that
Feb 21 19:23:35 <korn3r>	as i do on any new install :)
Feb 21 19:23:46 <Khaytsus>	korn3r: So you like eth0/eth1 swapping randomly?  Why?
Feb 21 19:23:55 <korn3r>	because i dont have eth1
Feb 21 19:24:02 <Khaytsus>	So why do you even care
Feb 21 19:24:04 <Khaytsus>	anyway
Feb 21 19:24:19 <korn3r>	i dont like enp0s-whatever naming
Feb 21 19:24:59 <korn3r>	and i write rules from time to time, so i like eth0 more than that new feature to help people with more than one network adapter
Feb 21 19:26:00 <Khaytsus>	zzzzzzzzz: Have you asked in #wireguard?  They have a pretty active channel last I looked.
Feb 21 19:26:43 <zzzzzzzzz>	i did no reply atm
Feb 21 19:27:30 <Khaytsus>	Might put together a pastebin of your router/server config, and your client config.  Of course redact keys
Feb 21 19:27:37 <Khaytsus>	make it clear which is which
Feb 21 19:29:20 <NeilRG>	does anyone know how ~/.local/bin  differs from ~/bin ?
Feb 21 19:29:28 <NeilRG>	kitty is suggesting I link to the former
Feb 21 19:29:39 <NeilRG>	but I have a few things linked in bin and nothing in the former
Feb 21 19:30:09 <uwharrie>	NeilRG: ~/bin is the traditional place to install executables in your home directory. ~/.local/bin/ is the newer XDG place
Feb 21 19:31:33 <NeilRG>	uwharrie, okay, should I prefer the newer place then and move everything over?
Feb 21 19:31:49 <Khaytsus>	Do what you want NeilRG
Feb 21 19:31:50 <cappy>	You can simlink one to the other.
Feb 21 19:32:17 <NeilRG>	I just want to know what the best practice is so that I can mindlessly follow it :)
Feb 21 19:32:29 <cappy>	s/simlink/symlink/
Feb 21 19:33:55 <uwharrie>	there is no best practice, it comes down to personal preference...does it bother you that you have directories in your home other than "My Documents" "My Pictures" "My Music" "My Desktop" etc? then use the XDG stuff to shove it all one directory deeper
Feb 21 19:34:04 <Khaytsus>	zzzzzzzzz: Here's mine, btw, you can compare.  I'm using 10.10.0.0/24.  If wg is working at all your keys are probably fine.  Check your client config AllowedIPs, sometimes people put the wrong value there.  https://paste.centos.org/view/70a6574e
Feb 21 19:34:19 <uwharrie>	otherwise it's deck chairs
Feb 21 19:34:55 <r1911>	i set net.ifnames=0 because i don't like interface names like enx00deadbeef00
Feb 21 19:37:00 <ioria>	Red Hat advises not to set net.ifnames=0
Feb 21 19:37:38 <ioria>	it breaks a bunch of things (it claims)
Feb 21 19:38:48 <r1911>	r1911: well that's red hat. i don't use rhel
Feb 21 19:38:55 <korn3r>	nothing for me yet. i doubt my pc is able do detect single network card in wrong order.
Feb 21 19:38:59 <zzzzzzzzz>	Khaytsus: my wirguard is working fine i can ping from each other >< on wiregurad IP my issue is from VPS public IP it wont forward to homePC
Feb 21 19:39:07 <ioria>	it suggests net.ifnames.prefix=net
Feb 21 19:39:19 <r1911>	net.ifnames=0 works fine
Feb 21 19:39:28 <Khaytsus>	zzzzzzzzz: Check client AllowedIPs, a lot of people put a specific IP or something there
Feb 21 19:40:25 <zzzzzzzzz>	i did not put anything and like i say wireguard works, if i put caddy infront it reverse proxy no problem issue is when i try to forward packets via iptables it does not work
Feb 21 19:40:39 <Khaytsus>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Feb 21 19:41:19 <zzzzzzzzz>	oh righ i have allowed ips but agian its 10.0.0.0/24
Feb 21 19:41:35 <zzzzzzzzz>	will put 0.0.0.0 and try tough i think that should not matter
Feb 21 19:41:39 <Khaytsus>	In the client config?  that's probably wrong.
Feb 21 19:41:51 <Khaytsus>	That would ONLY route traffic into the wireguard network, but NOT any other traffic.
Feb 21 19:42:13 <rocks>	You don't need net.ifnames=0 if you use the modern things like systemd-networkd to configure your interfaces based on their properties, like MAC, rather than some name. You also get the bonus of being able to rename them if you really do want them called eth0 etc.
Feb 21 19:42:25 <rocks>	Bi-winning!
Feb 21 19:44:24 <ssm_>	names are fine, assuming you're not changing your hardware, or if there's a race condition with driver loading
Feb 21 19:45:30 <Khaytsus>	Dual interfaces WILL randomly flip flop..  it was a real annoyance before the 'new' naming scheme.
Feb 21 19:45:50 <Khaytsus>	I used to have stupid scripts that looked at the mac address to figure out which was which
Feb 21 19:46:16 <r1911>	if you have that problem just use udev to set it up
Feb 21 19:47:09 <Khaytsus>	Seems like that solution didn't fix it either for some reason...  If I recall it would run into a collision sometimes.  Been a long time.
Feb 21 19:47:21 <Khaytsus>	The new interface name scheme works perfectly fine.
Feb 21 19:48:00 <r1911>	the names are just weird
Feb 21 19:48:23 <Khaytsus>	I don't care, they go in a few scripts and that's that.
Feb 21 19:51:25 <korn3r>	rocks: yeah... nice property to configure interface, MAC. very human-friendly
Feb 21 19:51:35 <korn3r>	(sarcasm)
Feb 21 19:51:43 <zzzzzzzzz>	Khaytsus: wht you mean only rout trafic into wireguard network
Feb 21 19:52:37 <Khaytsus>	zzzzzzzzz: If your client AllowedIPs is set to 10.0.0.0/24 it means that it will only route packets to 10.0.0.0/24 through wireguard.  Set it to 0/0 to have it route ALL packets through wireguard, assuming that's what you want.
Feb 21 19:55:13 <zzzzzzzzz>	but i want it to only communicate in 10.0.0.0/24 netwokr betwean VPS and homePC, my only issue is  VPS:PublicIP >> iptable wont forward masquade it to 10.0.0.2 homePC
Feb 21 19:56:14 <mlu>	zzzzzzzzz: masquerading happens after routing
Feb 21 19:56:32 <mlu>	zzzzzzzzz: i.e. if you go over a VPN link, the masquerading doesn't happen beacuse it's not over the public link
Feb 21 19:58:37 <budjaviIRC-zzzzz>	<budjaviIRC-zzzzz> sorry i got droped form irc cuz nickname ..... zzzzzzzzzz << did you replay to me soemthing
Feb 21 20:13:23 <CrtxReavr>	What's the best way to correlate what one sees in lspci with lsmod?
Feb 21 20:15:19 <calamari>	I'm attempting to troubleshoot an avahi problem, where avahi-resolve-host-name NAME.local doesn't work. I set the host-name, domain-name=local, and allow-interfaces (and commented out deny-interfaces). I checked that no firewall is blocking it. I ran it foreground. Both linux devices are on the same network switch and can ssh/ping in both directions. Any tips on troubleshooting this?
Feb 21 20:15:53 <calamari>	*ran avahi-daemon foreground
Feb 21 20:16:37 <suid_dumpable>	CrtxReavr: lspci -k
Feb 21 20:20:17 <CrtxReavr>	suid_dumpable, ahh - perfect - thanks.
Feb 21 20:22:40 <korn3r>	calamari: are you sure multicast is allowed in network? do you see packets in tcpdump?
Feb 21 20:23:26 <calamari>	korn3r: Not sure. What should I run to answer your questions?
Feb 21 20:24:26 <calamari>	korn3r: Note: the system I'm trying to get info from does not have tcpdump
Feb 21 20:25:10 <korn3r>	well, you can check if another system gets those packets
Feb 21 20:26:32 <rocks>	or install tcpdump
Feb 21 20:27:25 <CrtxReavr>	tcpdump -i <nic> net 224.0.0.0/4
Feb 21 20:27:36 <CrtxReavr>	See if there's any multicast in use.
Feb 21 20:28:14 <calamari>	CrtxReavr: What do I put for nic?
Feb 21 20:28:23 <CrtxReavr>	Oh boy.
Feb 21 20:28:41 <calamari>	Sorry, not a mind reader
Feb 21 20:28:48 <rocks>	"any" will work so we don't have to have another discussion about NIC naming
Feb 21 20:28:56 <CrtxReavr>	nic - network interface card
Feb 21 20:29:02 <CrtxReavr>	ip a
Feb 21 20:29:44 <calamari>	oh, the network device name
Feb 21 20:29:55 <TuxJobs>	I just managed to find the error output `Warning: Cannot convert string "/valid/path/to/a.xpm" to type Pixmap`. That is bizarre. How would it consider the path to the .xpm a "string" which it tries to "convert" to a Pixmap? It's just a standard file path... `MyCustomApplication*iconPixmap: /valid/path/to/a.xpm` in `~/.Xresources`. What could it be talking about?
Feb 21 20:30:43 <CrtxReavr>	What does ``file "/valid/path/to/a.xpm"`` say?
Feb 21 20:32:59 <TuxJobs>	CrtxReavr: "X pixmap image text, 256 x 256 x 167, 2 chars/pixel"
Feb 21 20:33:08 <calamari>	CrtxReavr: thanks.. I see entries on the machine that I'm calling avahi-resolve-host-name from. Once I get tcpdump installed on this embedded system I can see if it's getting those packets too
Feb 21 20:33:09 <CrtxReavr>	Hmm
Feb 21 20:34:07 <CrtxReavr>	TuxJobs, is that xpm file path specified in a config file somewhere?
Feb 21 20:34:09 <[twisti]>	i changed one of my raspi's ssh port and instantly forgot it. is there a trivial way to scan its ip to see on which port sshd is listening ? i got my login and private key file, just accidentally overwrote the changed port in my config
Feb 21 20:34:31 <CrtxReavr>	sudo nmap -sT <up>
Feb 21 20:34:36 <CrtxReavr>	s/up/ip
Feb 21 20:34:46 <rocks>	You don't need sudo for a plain TCP scan
Feb 21 20:35:22 <CrtxReavr>	Might need to add a -p0 depending on how it's configured.
Feb 21 20:36:22 <rocks>	TuxJobs: https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/cygwin/2019-12/msg00305.html

Feb 21 20:38:10 <rocks>	or is it the future?
Feb 21 20:38:20 <CrtxReavr>	That depends. . . got in the habbit on systems that required the source port to be  <1024

Feb 21 20:39:20 *	rocks throws West Coast signs
Feb 21 20:39:35 <FlorianBad>	I have a laptop that has 2 graphics, one Nvidia and a more basic integrated thing. Is there a kernel parameter I can use to prevent kernel from trying to use the nvidia and just have the most basic graphics with integrated?
Feb 21 20:39:51 <CrtxReavr>	I grew up on the left coast. . . always felt three hours behind.
Feb 21 20:41:18 <CrtxReavr>	Was watching Geraldo Rivera opening "Al Capone's Vaults" on TV, and my home came home and says "Oh, they didn't find anything. . . heard on the radio."
Feb 21 20:41:24 <wigums>	FlorianBad yes. or you can blacklist its module
Feb 21 20:41:35 <calamari>	CrtxReavr: the embedded system is receiving the multicast packets okay, so I'm assuming I've misconfigured avahi-daemon in some way.
Feb 21 20:41:53 <FlorianBad>	wigums, what would be the kernel parameter?
Feb 21 20:42:40 <CrtxReavr>	calamari, I know pretty much nothing about avahi.
Feb 21 20:42:48 <FlorianBad>	wigums, there must be some kernel parameter because the USB setup of that same kernel works, while the installed version gives no graphics at all
Feb 21 20:42:55 <CrtxReavr>	Know a fair bit about multicast, but that's it.
Feb 21 20:56:58 <upgreydd>	hey guys. Any iptables guru here? I need a little help. I have remote server with squid installed on port 3128. Server have openvpn-client installed too. I'd like to forward traffic from squid 3128 to tun0 interface. How to route that? I'm digging in the internet from few hours, trying some stuff with no luck. Any help welcome. Thank you in advice
Feb 21 20:57:11 <Disconsented>	heh I get that reference
Feb 21 20:57:43 <upgreydd>	Disconsented, teach me then ;)
Feb 21 20:57:59 <Disconsented>	I would if I'd ever played with any of that
Feb 21 20:58:15 <Disconsented>	The only general advice I have for the VPN side is wireguard or tailscale
Feb 21 20:58:46 <bombastick>	upgreydd: if you dont get any help, ask your buddy George Parsons-Taylor IV
Feb 21 20:59:19 <bombastick>	it seems to know everything about popular Linux systems
Feb 21 20:59:48 <nvz>	there is an open source tailscale, called headscale
Feb 21 21:00:11 <rocks>	Connections go to squid on TCP/3128, not from it, so it's not clear what's being asked
Feb 21 21:00:18 <upgreydd>	bombastick, +1 ;)
Feb 21 21:00:54 <JakLareo>	upgreydd: could you clarify what you want to accomplish? I would expect that other machines would be connecting *to* squid on that port, since it's a proxy server. What are you looking to do?
Feb 21 21:00:54 <AndyCap>	upgreydd: traffic will generally go where the routing table tells it to go.
Feb 21 21:02:10 <nvz>	and in case the you didnt know upgrayedd is spelled thusly... U-P-G-R-A-Y-E-D-D, with two Ds for a double dose of his pimping

Feb 21 21:04:06 <bombastick>	I dont understand people who dont like comedies. Critics especially seem to hate them. Like, how is Hot Time Time Machine 2 a 5/10? It's hilarious!
Feb 21 21:04:50 <velix>	Hot tube time Machine ?
Feb 21 21:05:04 <velix>	How I met your time machine.
Feb 21 21:05:57 <Disconsented>	They're not really the kinds of movies that work for critics

Feb 21 21:10:27 <velix>	man... those old aplpications drive me crazy.
Feb 21 21:10:35 <velix>	the documentation is bigger than the bible.
Feb 21 21:10:42 <lantech19446>	lol no it's not, the sex pistols had to tour as SPOTS because they offended so many people that everywhere literally cancelled them.
Feb 21 21:10:47 <velix>	and bigger than ikea catalog.
Feb 21 21:10:58 <velix>	even the NY telephonebook has less entries.
Feb 21 21:11:26 <W_t>	well there were no websites with docs back then
Feb 21 21:11:29 <velix>	it's easier to find Taylor's telephone number than to find the right switch by trying.
Feb 21 21:11:53 <W_t>	and the old manuals were usually very good, or, people made supplementary documentation beside them.

Feb 21 21:14:09 <Disconsented>	And frankly, that comes off as a dog whistle
Feb 21 21:14:14 <velix>	In Germany we have freedom of opinion, but we can be repressed if we express it.

Feb 21 21:15:07 <lantech19446>	r1911: your premise is conceptually flawed
Feb 21 21:15:14 <r1911>	lantech19446: what?
Feb 21 21:15:25 <velix>	oh man... " -crop 244x44+640+82 -strip -trim +repage" ... there is nothing wrong here!
Feb 21 21:15:29 <rocks>	upgreydd: Usually you will set up OpenVPN to configure routes on the client/server when it connects
Feb 21 21:16:00 <r1911>	velix: have you seen that akik guy?
Feb 21 21:16:11 <r1911>	or was it n4dir?
Feb 21 21:16:19 <Disconsented>	akik got klined
Feb 21 21:16:27 <r1911>	oh it was n4dir. he said akik is an audio guy
Feb 21 21:16:56 <r1911>	i'm trying to get some delay off my audio chain
Feb 21 21:17:04 <velix>	What? akik got klined again??
Feb 21 21:17:23 <velix>	we really need to patch him...
Feb 21 21:17:24 <upgreydd>	rocks, I can't - server is delivered by 3rd party. but I have an idea what I can do - I can add routing specified fqdn over openvpn - maybe that will work
Feb 21 21:17:39 <r1911>	what k-line?
Feb 21 21:17:43 <r1911>	irc k-line?
Feb 21 21:17:44 <lantech19446>	r1911: I literally gave you an example of cancel culture from before 1980
Feb 21 21:17:56 <netmask>	upgreydd: if I get what you're asking, you'd like the end flow to be:    user -> proxysquid:3128 -> vpn -> internet destination ?
Feb 21 21:18:12 <rocks>	upgreydd: In that case, it's odd that you want to provide access to your squid from some third party service, or did you really mean you want to send squid's outbound traffic over the VPN?
Feb 21 21:18:16 <r1911>	lantech19446: it has become so much more frequent now
Feb 21 21:18:57 <r1911>	you say a wrong word and you'll get shitlisted
Feb 21 21:19:31 <upgreydd>	netmask, yes exactly that's what I need
Feb 21 21:19:40 <lantech19446>	r1911: if you're a racist / homophone / transphobe / anti-semite you probably deserve it
Feb 21 21:19:46 <netmask>	and if that's the case, it's should simply be a matter of pushing a default route (0.0.0.0/0) to the openvpn client on the squid box
Feb 21 21:20:00 <uwharrie>	can this garbage go to #linux-offtopic or ##politics?
Feb 21 21:20:04 <Disconsented>	Yeah
Feb 21 21:20:07 <upgreydd>	rocks, I want send my squid outbound traffic to vpn service
Feb 21 21:20:08 <Disconsented>	Time to move on from this
Feb 21 21:20:09 <rocks>	You need to be a little careful if you need to retain network access while changing a default route
Feb 21 21:20:12 <netmask>	you're essentially asking the openvpn client route all internet traffic towards the openvpn server
Feb 21 21:20:13 <r1911>	lantech19446: huh?
Feb 21 21:20:19 <r1911>	lantech19446: was that meant for me?
Feb 21 21:20:45 <lantech19446>	i'm not saying you are those things but that tends to be what people get shitlisted for these days
Feb 21 21:20:48 *	neoncortex shitlist everybody
Feb 21 21:20:50 <r1911>	lantech19446: i'm none of those things but the woke has other ideas
Feb 21 21:20:54 <W_t>	r1911: probably more a general label, for arbitrary client actions
Feb 21 21:21:00 <netmask>	rocks: yeah for sure.. though it sounds like he's using some sort of VPS, and probably has console access in case he locks himself out
Feb 21 21:21:03 <upgreydd>	rocks, that's what I exactly face - my other services are gone while doing route for 0.0.0.0 and I don't want that
Feb 21 21:22:50 <r1911>	now i understand why that akik guy is not here if he got k-lined :D
Feb 21 21:22:58 <rocks>	You may need to ignore the default route that gets pushed by the OpenVPN server first then
Feb 21 21:23:20 <neoncortex>	he was shitlisted.
Feb 21 21:23:47 <bombastick>	lantech19446: do you realize by today's definitions, 99% of the population from 10 years ago would be called a transphobe or racist or homophone? Plus these accusations are often  used as a cudgel to beat or scare people who oppose your politics (you = the elite, not you personally, you're just a well-meaning pawn)
Feb 21 21:23:49 <upgreydd>	rocks, I've ignored it - now I need to add one somehow. I think maybe I can add separate routing table for VPN then somehow try to route traffic over it
Feb 21 21:24:41 <JakLareo>	Can I second the call for this off-topic conversation to be taken elsewhere?
Feb 21 21:24:46 <lantech19446>	bombastick: I absolutely have done things in my past that would warrant those labels, honestly all but the anti-semite label.
Feb 21 21:24:51 <bombastick>	JakLareo: #bsd?
Feb 21 21:25:05 <rocks>	You can do that, yes. Something like 'ip route add default dev tun0 table 1234' then 'ip rule' with rules to match the traffic you want to send over VPN
Feb 21 21:25:20 <netmask>	i've never done VRFs inside linux, but it would probably be what you want
Feb 21 21:25:30 <netmask>	separate routing domains for different interfaces
Feb 21 21:25:37 <r1911>	bombastick: it's enough to criticize islam and you'll be an instant islamophobe :D
Feb 21 21:25:45 <netmask>	one for you 'internal proxy' shenanigans, the other for your external services
Feb 21 21:25:52 <lantech19446>	ok I think I'm annoying people so we'll just leave it at that
Feb 21 21:25:54 <Khaytsus>	Can we move on.  Please.

Feb 21 21:32:00 <bombastick>	I'm thinking I'll finally reorganize my NAS
Feb 21 21:32:04 <Khaytsus>	Keep on topic.  Suggestes completely off-topic thing.
Feb 21 21:32:23 <bombastick>	a multi-year endeavor, unless AI helps me with that too

Feb 21 21:36:25 <velix>	It was such a good OCR :(
Feb 21 21:36:45 <hodapp>	not allowed?
Feb 21 21:36:49 <velix>	hodapp: russian product
Feb 21 21:36:59 <nvz>	heh
Feb 21 21:37:23 <hodapp>	oh, yeah, sometimes we have to nix otherwise good tools because of Russian/Chinese origins and a customer that has strict requirements
Feb 21 21:37:26 <bombastick>	velix: you're not allowed to use FOSS written by Russians? is that right?
Feb 21 21:38:04 <velix>	bombastick: Yeah. Our customers don't allow any russian-based software to be use because of sanctions
Feb 21 21:38:10 <hodapp>	velix: gov?
Feb 21 21:38:17 <velix>	hodapp: yep
Feb 21 21:38:19 <hodapp>	US?
Feb 21 21:38:26 <velix>	hodapp: Germany.
Feb 21 21:38:31 <bombastick>	velix: even if you recompile it/ package it yourself? Like if you called it "velixform"?
Feb 21 21:38:39 <velix>	hodapp: The customer is a federal authority.
Feb 21 21:38:39 <rocks>	Easier and cheaper to say no to it than commit to full code reviews
Feb 21 21:38:46 <hodapp>	velix: ah, I figure they've a lot of similar restrictions
Feb 21 21:39:15 <velix>	bombastick: The source code is still Russia-based... I specifically requested it and it was rejected.
Feb 21 21:39:34 <hodapp>	velix: how's it compare with Tesseract? Or commercial likes like ABBYY WhateverReader
Feb 21 21:39:39 <velix>	So I don't want to try any tricks to get around this.
Feb 21 21:40:30 <velix>	hodapp: Unfortunately, Tesseract is based on word lists and dictionaries. I use it to recognize anonymized codes from questionnaires. ffwQRT3 and stuff like that. Unfortunately, Tesseract doesn't work well at all.
Feb 21 21:40:50 <bombastick>	ah, Europe. Makes sense, you're a vassal state for a real power that hates Russia. So what will you do now? Switch to Tesseract?
Feb 21 21:41:17 <velix>	bombastick: I think I'll go for some OpenCV stuff and Convolution Networks.
Feb 21 21:41:32 <hodapp>	velix: oh, yeah, I have run Tesseract through some similar content and it would fail miserably when it didn't have the help of the probabilistic models
Feb 21 21:41:46 <hodapp>	not sure if I tried Cuneiform or not, this was years ago
Feb 21 21:42:03 <Pikk3wyn>	who cares if the source code is russian
Feb 21 21:42:13 <velix>	Pikk3wyn: don't blame me.
Feb 21 21:42:17 <Pikk3wyn>	if it's been evaluated and passes checks
Feb 21 21:42:28 <Pikk3wyn>	what difference does it make if it was from mars
Feb 21 21:42:48 <Pikk3wyn>	code is code, it either works, doesn't work, or does something it's not supposed to
Feb 21 21:42:52 <velix>	Pikk3wyn: all those trolls try to protect their market, see Huawai
Feb 21 21:43:00 <bombastick>	Pikk3wyn: not easy to evaluate a 200k LOC codebase. Very expensive actually.
Feb 21 21:43:05 <hodapp>	Pikk3wyn: uh, it is that "does something it's not supposed to" that is a very difficult thing to audit
Feb 21 21:43:16 <Pikk3wyn>	bombastick: that's very fair
Feb 21 21:43:40 <Khaytsus>	Customers like the government can impose all kinds of restrictions on how their data is used, how the product you create for them is created, etc.
Feb 21 21:43:44 <Pikk3wyn>	I'm simply wondering that, assuming the code passes, what difference does it make
Feb 21 21:43:49 <hodapp>	also, code's "working" or "not working" isn't really a binary thing, anytime its inputs start to have any level of complexity to them
Feb 21 21:44:00 <hodapp>	even assuming no vulnerabilities in it, that by itself is a very hard thing to evaluate
Feb 21 21:44:12 <Pikk3wyn>	hodapp: that's why I said 'or does something it's not supposed to'
Feb 21 21:44:13 <neoncortex>	there is good wordlists/dictionaries available on linux?  there is that files in /usr/share/dict, they are not super good but it helps.  If there is some standard, I can have multi language completion in my tmux ide easily.
Feb 21 21:44:29 <Pikk3wyn>	neoncortex: password cracking, or actual dictionaries?
Feb 21 21:44:40 <neoncortex>	actual dictionaries.
Feb 21 21:44:40 <Khaytsus>	neoncortex: I just use dictd and aspell for dictionary and spelling
Feb 21 21:44:53 <velix>	Interesting, why does SSH return a 403? :-)
Feb 21 21:44:59 <neoncortex>	Khaytsus: I have my own interfacing, I just want lists.
Feb 21 21:45:03 <Pikk3wyn>	neoncortex: check aiksaurus
Feb 21 21:45:11 <neoncortex>	ok.
Feb 21 21:45:32 <Pikk3wyn>	also vim-thesaurus_query plugin
Feb 21 21:46:00 <hodapp>	but if you've ever dealt with government bureaucrat types: good luck, everything is about paperwork and processes
Feb 21 21:46:09 <velix>	hodapp: some are paperless now ;)
Feb 21 21:46:10 <Pikk3wyn>	also aspell/hunspell might have you covered
Feb 21 21:46:11 <hodapp>	so even a formal proof of the soundness of the code would not be relevant
Feb 21 21:46:19 <velix>	hodapp: but it's the same document, just digital :D
Feb 21 21:46:23 <hodapp>	it is a checkbox about where the code came from
Feb 21 21:46:29 <Pikk3wyn>	hodapp: you gotta outplay them at their own game
Feb 21 21:46:37 <velix>	Pikk3wyn: Passierschein A38.
Feb 21 21:46:43 <hodapp>	Pikk3wyn: by... filing more paperwork?
Feb 21 21:47:08 <Pikk3wyn>	generate valid and EXTREMELY verbose reports regarding the softwares functionality
Feb 21 21:47:16 <velix>	The A 38 pass from the animated film Asterix Conquers Rome, a satire on bureaucracy, is now used to describe it.
Feb 21 21:47:34 <circuitbone>	nltk in python as well neoncortex
Feb 21 21:47:35 <neoncortex>	Pikk3wyn: yeah, Im using some list from hunspell, and that files from /usr/share/dict.  For portuguese and english, but if there is something better =D
Feb 21 21:47:35 <Pikk3wyn>	give em a fat stack of sheets, 'heres my proof, its human readable, i assume you know how to use a dictionary'
Feb 21 21:47:39 <hodapp>	Pikk3wyn: if their process doesn't comprehend that, it's going in the garbage
Feb 21 21:47:50 <circuitbone>	a large corpus or corpora
Feb 21 21:47:53 <Pikk3wyn>	hodapp: what sort of processes are required
Feb 21 21:47:55 <Pikk3wyn>	specifically
Feb 21 21:48:03 <Pikk3wyn>	in order to qualify the code as 'approved'
Feb 21 21:48:28 <Pikk3wyn>	apart from actually making sure it's legit yourself ofc :)
Feb 21 21:48:42 <kfrench>	hodapp: You can't argue with a piece of paper
Feb 21 21:48:46 <neoncortex>	circuitbone: oh, checking.
Feb 21 21:48:47 <Pikk3wyn>	what is the basis of their argument
Feb 21 21:49:02 <hodapp>	Pikk3wyn: depends on a billion things at once but it often comes down to a mandate that, with no exceptions, the code can't be developed from some countries
Feb 21 21:49:44 <Pikk3wyn>	hodapp: is it truly without exception?
Feb 21 21:50:01 <Pikk3wyn>	for example, if it was written by an expat abroad? does that affect it?
Feb 21 21:50:19 <Pikk3wyn>	it's like apple putting a tiny screw in a premade item and saying 'made in america' instead of china
Feb 21 21:50:39 <hodapp>	Pikk3wyn: that tends to be something they're rather uninterested in discussing
Feb 21 21:51:03 <Pikk3wyn>	then you just need to alter it enough that it's 'made in america' ;)
Feb 21 21:51:08 <W_t>	'designed in cupertino' was usually the apple line, afaik.
Feb 21 21:51:13 <hodapp>	you can find/make exceptions, but they'll almost never be driven by the person rubber-stamping paperwork
Feb 21 21:51:22 <W_t>	it clearly stated china as the producer though.
Feb 21 21:51:30 <Pikk3wyn>	hodapp: you just gotta make sure to befuddle them
Feb 21 21:51:35 <uwharrie>	hodapp: you sound like you're making this all up and you've never actually worked for a large entity with multiple layers of bureaucacy. In reality it's so simple. Find the boss of it all and tell him to do what you want. :P
Feb 21 21:52:02 <Pikk3wyn>	if you frame it like 'we got this framework we developed, all locally made, and took inspiration from open source'
Feb 21 21:52:03 <rv1sr>	In htop 3.3.0, I just noticed the username of some processes is pink/light-red. I know the meaning of the differend colors in the "command" column but haven't seen colors in the "user" column before. In this example it's systemd-timesyncd, dbus-broker-launch and rtkit-daemon. I don't see any obvious difference to the other tasks (user shown in default grey). Does anyone has an explanation for this?
Feb 21 21:52:09 <Pikk3wyn>	you dont need to tell em it's russian
Feb 21 21:52:16 <Pikk3wyn>	and 'took inspiration
Feb 21 21:52:22 <Pikk3wyn>	is a very wide range of things
Feb 21 21:52:30 <Pikk3wyn>	lie without lying
Feb 21 21:52:44 <Armand>	So, directly lying.
Feb 21 21:52:46 <Khaytsus>	Yeah, lie to the government.  That's a way to get contracts cancelled and fined.
Feb 21 21:52:48 <Pikk3wyn>	no
Feb 21 21:52:49 <Armand>	^
Feb 21 21:52:51 <Khaytsus>	Let's move on.  this is going nowhere.
Feb 21 21:52:52 <Pikk3wyn>	it's not lying
Feb 21 21:53:16 <Pikk3wyn>	it's just another way of saying you took other code and made it your own
Feb 21 21:53:22 <Pikk3wyn>	what defines 'made it your own'?
Feb 21 21:53:26 <Pikk3wyn>	whatever tf you want
Feb 21 21:53:37 <Pikk3wyn>	refactor it abit, rename some libs or whatever
Feb 21 21:53:46 <Armand>	So, just be fundamentally dishonest.
Feb 21 21:53:53 <scottpedia>	i think to refuse whatever written by russians is just pure paranoia
Feb 21 21:53:56 <uwharrie>	excellent, now you're likely violating the GPL!
Feb 21 21:54:20 <Pikk3wyn>	Armand: it's not unethical unless there is a danger
Feb 21 21:54:35 <Pikk3wyn>	if you have checked it, refactored it, and it's all good
Feb 21 21:54:35 <neoncortex>	do some logic inversions, change the name of the variables and functions, change the place of the things xD
Feb 21 21:54:41 <Armand>	At least I know who I can't trust..
Feb 21 21:54:41 <hodapp>	uwharrie: no, this is definitely what I work with
Feb 21 21:54:42 <Pikk3wyn>	the rest is window dressing
Feb 21 21:54:57 <scottpedia>	it's FOSS not like some closed-source proprietary, as long as there are reviewers there is no chance that they would have spyweres and such
Feb 21 21:55:04 <Pikk3wyn>	Armand: you know you can trust me to get stuff done :P
Feb 21 21:55:10 <Armand>	Nope.
Feb 21 21:55:33 <Pikk3wyn>	if you refuse to use perfectly good code, if I convince you that the code is different enough, that's doing you a favor :)
Feb 21 21:55:47 <Pikk3wyn>	unless you're a beaurocrat, you got nothing to worry about
Feb 21 21:56:20 <Pikk3wyn>	it's difficult to persuade someone rational in that way, because the reason they refuse is irrational
Feb 21 21:56:30 <Pikk3wyn>	ergo, they are irrational, and easy to herd around
Feb 21 21:57:04 <Pikk3wyn>	that sort of thing doesn't work with someone who has more than 3.5 functioning braincells
Feb 21 21:57:05 <scottpedia>	and how are you supposed to know if any FOSS project is of russian origin?
Feb 21 21:57:24 <scottpedia>	it doesn't even have a physical address probably
Feb 21 21:57:50 <Pikk3wyn>	Armand: it's not fundamentally dishonest unless you legitimately would side with the pencil pushers
Feb 21 21:57:55 <neoncortex>	how it change anything?  From russia, or from guatemala, or whatever, code is code.
Feb 21 21:58:27 <Pikk3wyn>	Armand: do you think it's better to follow a meaningless and detrimental regulation, when circumventing it is only beneficial for everyone with no risk
Feb 21 21:58:34 <Pikk3wyn>	?
Feb 21 21:58:38 <Pikk3wyn>	hehe ;)
Feb 21 21:58:46 <Pikk3wyn>	Khaytsus: sorry i just saw now
Feb 21 21:59:02 <Pikk3wyn>	eh, ja, it is somewhat going nowhere
Feb 21 21:59:11 <Pikk3wyn>	neoncortex: deadass lol
Feb 21 21:59:24 <neoncortex>	=D
Feb 21 21:59:46 <Pikk3wyn>	they dealing with some pencil pushing photocopied mindless government thralls
Feb 21 22:00:28 <Pikk3wyn>	unecessary and bizarre regulations are par for that course :P
Feb 21 22:00:49 <Pikk3wyn>	but it's circumventable
Feb 21 22:01:31 <Pikk3wyn>	you don't actually lie to them, you just give them a truth they want to hear
Feb 21 22:01:57 <Pikk3wyn>	everyone wins in the end so it's not like it's immoral XD
Feb 21 22:02:23 <[twisti]>	i often use one of those wifis where when you first connect, it makes you click okay or i agree or whatever on one of those 'play nice' login sites. are there any tools that will automatically do that in the background ? it asks again after an hour and sometimes when i play something or whatnot, ill miss it and wonder why the internet stops working
Feb 21 22:02:40 <Pikk3wyn>	[twisti]: yes, i believe there are
Feb 21 22:02:52 <Pikk3wyn>	also tho, a good 50% you can just straight bypass
Feb 21 22:02:57 <Pikk3wyn>	very easily
Feb 21 22:03:07 <[twisti]>	how so ?
Feb 21 22:03:18 <[twisti]>	and what would i search to find tools like that ?
Feb 21 22:03:30 <Pikk3wyn>	no tools needed really
Feb 21 22:03:47 <Pikk3wyn>	other than macchanger and ip route
Feb 21 22:03:49 <Pikk3wyn>	sometimes just set the default route to the correct gateway, sometimes only dns is needed
Feb 21 22:03:57 <Khaytsus>	[twisti]: that's often called a captive portal, maybe that'll help.
Feb 21 22:04:09 <[twisti]>	ill have to google that, thanks
Feb 21 22:04:13 <Pikk3wyn>	sometimes change the mac address to the same family as the wifi APs
Feb 21 22:04:29 <Khaytsus>	But yeah sometimes they just redirect all 80/443 traffic but don't block anything else.  Sane ones will block everything however.
Feb 21 22:04:41 <Pikk3wyn>	sometimes you can just spoof that you are one of the APs, and spam that ap with WPA disconnects
Feb 21 22:04:55 <Khaytsus>	Pikk3wyn: I think you got lost in the weeds there
Feb 21 22:04:58 <Khaytsus>	He's not cracking WEP
Feb 21 22:05:04 <Khaytsus>	He's trying to automate a captive portal
Feb 21 22:05:05 <Pikk3wyn>	no, the access point
Feb 21 22:05:08 <TuxJobs>	CrtxReavr: What do you mean? `MyCustomApplication*iconPixmap: /valid/path/to/a.xpm` in `~/.Xresources`, like I said? Do you mean something else?
Feb 21 22:05:16 <Pikk3wyn>	you can spoof the MAC of one of the wifi extenders
Feb 21 22:05:21 <Pikk3wyn>	then disconnect the extender
Feb 21 22:05:28 <uwharrie>	so easy!
Feb 21 22:05:30 <Khaytsus>	That seems excessive
Feb 21 22:05:31 <Pikk3wyn>	they are almost always whitelisted
Feb 21 22:05:51 <Pikk3wyn>	Khaytsus: i have no sympathy for people running captive redirects
Feb 21 22:06:01 <Khaytsus>	Pikk3wyn: they hvae a zillion useful uses
Feb 21 22:06:06 <Pikk3wyn>	if the walls are made of paper, ill tear em down :P
Feb 21 22:06:13 <Pikk3wyn>	Khaytsus: i know, and i agree
Feb 21 22:06:25 <Pikk3wyn>	i have personally configured a few for people
Feb 21 22:06:30 <Pikk3wyn>	i just hate them myself :P
Feb 21 22:06:41 <TuxJobs>	rocks: Is the conclusion from that page that I need "xbitmaps" installed? Because I already do.
Feb 21 22:06:45 <Khaytsus>	Breaking someones network to try to get around one isn't very nice
Feb 21 22:06:52 <Pikk3wyn>	Khaytsus: it's only temporary
Feb 21 22:07:05 <r1911>	life is temporary
Feb 21 22:07:07 <Pikk3wyn>	and they don't need 3 wifi extenders in a coffeeshop anyway :P
Feb 21 22:07:58 <Pikk3wyn>	also, you can try set your dhcp ID the same as one of the access points, or scan the network and see if there are any kiosks or something you can try steal the lease
Feb 21 22:08:08 <Elw3>	hmmm so this tar.gz is 1.5gb but inside is a 500mb .image file. How? What?
Feb 21 22:08:10 <Khaytsus>	And like a lot of things...  they are often put there to improve overall usage.  If say a hotel let every laptop, tablet, and phone suck on the internet 24/7 it'd be slow as dialup.  When they only allow temporary sessions and a captive portal to get a new session it allows active users access.
Feb 21 22:08:13 <r1911>	i think it's illegal to mess with other people's network equipment in most countries
Feb 21 22:08:14 <Pikk3wyn>	spoof the same mac family even works pretty well
Feb 21 22:08:27 <Pikk3wyn>	Khaytsus: sure
Feb 21 22:08:29 <Pikk3wyn>	that's why they exist
Feb 21 22:08:45 <Pikk3wyn>	to keep 99% of everyone else from using it properly
Feb 21 22:08:51 <NeilRG>	can I use AUR with ubuntu?
Feb 21 22:08:52 <Khaytsus>	Like my university in the early 2000's..  Someone literally ran a WISP off their wifi, dragging the whole system down.
Feb 21 22:09:01 <Elw3>	Thas is the bacotera linux arm image, i wonder if that works. This doesnt make sense...
Feb 21 22:09:15 <Pikk3wyn>	if you run a speedtest, get an idea of the throughput + load, limit your own speed
Feb 21 22:09:23 <Pikk3wyn>	then you won't make it fall over :)
Feb 21 22:09:45 <Pikk3wyn>	hotels should have very fast internet tho
Feb 21 22:10:23 <Pikk3wyn>	idk about america but i have installed probably 4 hotels with gbit lines, 1 with 500mbit
Feb 21 22:10:25 <W_t>	I change mac addresses ofter than I exchange my empty beercan for a new one, fwiw
Feb 21 22:10:40 <Khaytsus>	gigabit?  Oh wow, that fast?
Feb 21 22:10:51 <Pikk3wyn>	i mean its not that fast?
Feb 21 22:11:00 <Khaytsus>	Hotels with hundreds of users would drag gigtabit into the mud without trying
Feb 21 22:11:01 <xangua>	NeilRG: Rhino Linux has an "aur like repository"
Feb 21 22:11:17 <NeilRG>	ok
Feb 21 22:11:21 <Pikk3wyn>	Khaytsus: let me check what they have now
Feb 21 22:11:25 <Pikk3wyn>	esc
Feb 21 22:11:25 <Pikk3wyn>	sec
Feb 21 22:11:30 <Khaytsus>	It doesn't matter
Feb 21 22:11:44 <Khaytsus>	they're going to pay for what they need for active users, not pay for what the other 80% of inactive users want.
Feb 21 22:12:07 <W_t>	it's not really cost-effective to sit at an hotel and torrent for that matter, also.
Feb 21 22:12:09 <Pikk3wyn>	oh i see what you mean
Feb 21 22:12:17 <Pikk3wyn>	yeah ofc they must limit it per user
Feb 21 22:12:41 <Khaytsus>	300 users with Windows downloading updates or something while they sleep is going to destroy the network for everyone else trying to actually just use it.
Feb 21 22:12:51 <Pikk3wyn>	Khaytsus: actually it wouldnt lol
Feb 21 22:12:57 <W_t>	you could just set up a seedbox or vpn remotely and run all your intensive operations through there
Feb 21 22:13:00 <Pikk3wyn>	it would use BITS to share the update on the lan
Feb 21 22:13:18 <W_t>	s/vpn/vps/
Feb 21 22:13:24 <Khaytsus>	Surely you don't think a hotel wifi isn't isolated
Feb 21 22:13:32 <Khaytsus>	It'd be insane to not be
Feb 21 22:13:38 <W_t>	they often are
Feb 21 22:13:42 <Khaytsus>	I'd hope they always are
Feb 21 22:13:45 <Pikk3wyn>	it would send it over the 'internet' to the hotel's public IP
Feb 21 22:13:52 <W_t>	not that I've 'hotelled' much since corona
Feb 21 22:14:10 <Khaytsus>	Public wifi in general should always have clients isolated from each other
Feb 21 22:14:15 <Pikk3wyn>	ja
Feb 21 22:14:34 <velix>	Is it normal when SFTP throws a 403 at you?
Feb 21 22:14:34 <scottpedia>	Khaytsus: should*
Feb 21 22:14:44 <scottpedia>	but oftentimes they are not
Feb 21 22:14:50 <Disconsented>	velix> 403 is a web thing
Feb 21 22:14:58 <xx>	so not normal then
Feb 21 22:15:04 <Khaytsus>	I've never heard of sftp and 403, no...
Feb 21 22:15:06 <velix>	I know ;) I'm trying to connect via WinSCP and it shows 403 ;)
Feb 21 22:15:13 <W_t>	403 is a httpd response
Feb 21 22:15:13 <velix>	it's 22:15 ... maaannnn
Feb 21 22:15:18 <velix>	W_t: I know ;)
Feb 21 22:15:22 <W_t>	heh
Feb 21 22:15:28 <scottpedia>	even worse they sometimes have upnp enabled
Feb 21 22:15:30 <velix>	Okay, #nightshift.
Feb 21 22:15:36 <velix>	who joins me?
Feb 21 22:15:40 <Khaytsus>	Actually, 403 is "file permissions error" in winscp, perhaps other clients
Feb 21 22:15:52 <velix>	nice... the IT department moved this server out of vsphere...
Feb 21 22:15:55 <Pikk3wyn>	scottpedia: not the ones that I setup, tho I have seen it in the wild
Feb 21 22:15:57 <velix>	Really... WHY do they do that??
Feb 21 22:15:59 <Khaytsus>	Used this fancy thing called a search engine
Feb 21 22:16:12 <Pikk3wyn>	haha only way i'd get past my ones is because I have access to em
Feb 21 22:17:45 <Pikk3wyn>	also kinda helps that the hotel has a server configured to deliver updates over the network to all the staff machines
Feb 21 22:17:47 <Pikk3wyn>	;)
Feb 21 22:18:40 <Pikk3wyn>	hard limiting speed instead of using queues is a skill issue
Feb 21 22:18:58 <Pikk3wyn>	if your mtik/cisco can handle hundreds of clients on gigabit, it should be able to use queues lol
Feb 21 22:19:04 <rocks>	rofl
Feb 21 22:20:03 <Pikk3wyn>	Khaytsus: i get you tho, and i 100% agree, the users need to be carefully herded into a small safe box
Feb 21 22:20:20 <Pikk3wyn>	too bad i'm violently claustrophobic :P
Feb 21 22:22:55 <Elw3>	hm is zcat linux.tar.gz > /dev/sda the right way to write an image? I fear that i merely put the folder representation of it on the drive instead the image itself.
Feb 21 22:23:55 <rocks>	What sort of image?
Feb 21 22:23:56 <nvz>	Elw3: zcat is only going to unzip the tar and write it to the device
Feb 21 22:24:24 <nvz>	not actually extract the tar, it just removes the compression
Feb 21 22:24:25 <rocks>	Image usually means something you'd write out linearly to a disk, rather than a tarball
Feb 21 22:24:37 <MacGyver>	Elw3: What, in your mind, is the difference between "the folder representation" and "the image itself"?
Feb 21 22:25:34 <Elw3>	Well MacGyver what happens if put two files into the archive and then try to write it like that?
Feb 21 22:25:45 <Elw3>	This is the bacotera rpi image
Feb 21 22:26:08 <nvz>	but yes, typically images are not stored in tarballs to begin with unless they're meant to be written to a tape :P
Feb 21 22:26:10 <Elw3>	they suck at writing instructions.
Feb 21 22:26:24 <nvz>	I'd run file on that thing and see what it actually is
Feb 21 22:26:44 <Elw3>	I cant because i cannot unpack it. Its basically a forkbomb
Feb 21 22:26:51 <Elw3>	Ehm zipbomb
Feb 21 22:26:53 <nvz>	heh
Feb 21 22:27:12 <Elw3>	So it appears its the full image of something of several gb
Feb 21 22:27:37 <Khaytsus>	Why not just follow their instructions?
Feb 21 22:27:37 <Elw3>	It compresses down to 1.5 but i have no way of making a midway unpack step
Feb 21 22:27:45 <Elw3>	There are no instructions.
Feb 21 22:27:49 <Khaytsus>	https://wiki.batocera.org/install_batocera
Feb 21 22:27:57 <MacGyver>	Elw3: If I go to batocera.org and download the image, the suggested filename is batocera-bcm2711-bcm2711-38-20231014.img.gz
Feb 21 22:28:09 <dTal>	I've never seen an image in a tarball
Feb 21 22:28:14 <dTal>	that would be pointless
Feb 21 22:28:19 <Elw3>	What kind of ARM did you not get Khaytsus ?
Feb 21 22:28:25 <r1911>	i've seen a cat picture in a tarball
Feb 21 22:28:33 <r1911>	it smiled at me
Feb 21 22:28:56 <dTal>	sigh, can you tell us where you got this file Elw3
Feb 21 22:28:56 <nvz>	Elw3: idk the images I'm seeing on batocera.linux are .img.gz not .tar.gz
Feb 21 22:29:01 <rocks>	So tl;dr you saved the file with the wrong extension
Feb 21 22:29:01 <Khaytsus>	Elw3: The instructions are clearly for a Pi, I don't know what you're trying to imply here.
Feb 21 22:29:09 <Khaytsus>	rocks: Or downloade the wrong file
Feb 21 22:29:48 <Elw3>	Nah i missttypet its img.gz indeed
Feb 21 22:29:50 <Khaytsus>	Although on their download page I don't see a single tar
Feb 21 22:30:13 <dTal>	then yeah that'll work
Feb 21 22:30:16 <Khaytsus>	https://wiki.batocera.org/install_batocera
Feb 21 22:30:35 <Khaytsus>	You can likely just dd it straight to an sdcard too
Feb 21 22:30:36 <korn3r>	gzip -c ./file | dd of=/path/to/device ?
Feb 21 22:30:43 <Elw3>	This is the x84 install with pictures of an rpi which you would see if you would read it Khaytsus
Feb 21 22:30:59 <Khaytsus>	Elw3: It is not.
Feb 21 22:31:15 <dTal>	Khaytsus: you can't dd a gzipped file straight to an SD card
Feb 21 22:31:22 <dTal>	I mean you can but the pi won't boot :p
Feb 21 22:31:24 <Khaytsus>	dTal: Of course not
Feb 21 22:31:41 <Khaytsus>	dTal: I mean, I assumed some common sense here.  I assume way too much, however.
Feb 21 22:31:53 <MacGyver>	Elw3: Then the zcat command you pasted is quite likely the exact command you want, because .img is usually just a byte-for-byte representation of the block device.
Feb 21 22:32:06 <dTal>	zcat file.gz > /dev/sdcard is the simplest way
Feb 21 22:32:22 <dTal>	no need to start throwing around dd
Feb 21 22:32:27 <Khaytsus>	Yep that'll work fine too
Feb 21 22:32:40 <nvz>	its an improper use of cat, for the pedantics, but it'd work
Feb 21 22:32:43 <nvz>	heh
Feb 21 22:32:48 <Khaytsus>	no it's not
Feb 21 22:32:49 <MacGyver>	nvz: *z*cat.
Feb 21 22:33:00 <W_t>	does khayt mean cat and sus mean sus so to speak
Feb 21 22:33:09 <dTal>	when I'm world dictator all the "improper use of cat" pedants will be rounded up and sent to camps for reeducation
Feb 21 22:33:10 <W_t>	your cat is suspect?
Feb 21 22:33:11 *	rocks offers 'gzip -cd file > /dev/sda '
Feb 21 22:33:26 <W_t>	free-minded soul
Feb 21 22:33:36 <Khaytsus>	W_t: Can you reduce the noise now?
Feb 21 22:33:36 <MacGyver>	rocks: Which is literally what zcat is shorthand for.
Feb 21 22:33:39 <hexnewbie>	zcat and gzip -cd are literally the same thing
Feb 21 22:33:45 <W_t>	Khaytsus: oh
Feb 21 22:33:55 <rocks>	I was avoiding the aupposed UUoC
Feb 21 22:35:13 <Elw3>	well its done writing, lets see
Feb 21 22:35:35 <dTal>	unix nerds: look the standard utils are a beautiful and orthogonal set of tools that each do one thing well and can be intuitively composed using pipes. Also unix nerd: wahhh don't use cat to pipe a file to stdin, learn each program's unique and special snowflake syntax for no reason other than I will make fun of you if you don't
Feb 21 22:36:34 <rocks>	Is UUoC better or worse than using shell redirection when a command can take a filename instead?
Feb 21 22:36:41 <steering>	dTal: well, there can be reasons, though there aren't for most programs
Feb 21 22:36:48 <dTal>	extra special mention to "it wastes resources by spawning another process"
Feb 21 22:36:51 <steering>	(particularly the command might want to be able to seek or write)
Feb 21 22:37:02 <neoncortex>	cat is dangerous.
Feb 21 22:37:53 <suid_dumpable>	neoncortex: because it spills file contents unfiltered to the terminal?
Feb 21 22:38:01 <neoncortex>	suid_dumpable: yes.
Feb 21 22:38:08 <hodapp>	use bat
Feb 21 22:38:15 <neoncortex>	it can be mitigated with -e switch.
Feb 21 22:39:05 <Khaytsus>	I prefer lolcat for max kekx
Feb 21 22:40:04 <geirha>	rocks: there were no useless use of cat there, cat wasn't even involved at all
Feb 21 22:40:05 <akk>	dTal: you don't need any special snowflake syntax to use <
Feb 21 22:40:18 <akk>	that works the same with every command
Feb 21 22:40:26 <n4dir>	a cat not involved at all seems like the most useless cat to me
Feb 21 22:42:47 <MacGyver>	#linux: "Don't use cat if you can avoid it!" Also #linux: "You're doing *anything* to something that looks like a block device? Must use dd!"
Feb 21 22:43:41 <steering>	^ kek
Feb 21 22:44:08 <neoncortex>	we are constantly evolving, it is not like we born with knowedge =D
Feb 21 22:44:09 <ananke>	MacGyver: that's a bit overdramatic
Feb 21 22:44:21 <suid_dumpable>	toilet --metal < /etc/fstab
Feb 21 22:45:23 <velix>	*klonk*
Feb 21 22:47:08 <wigums>	no cats were harmed in the making of this conversation
Feb 21 22:50:53 <velix>	For real, how much can a software suck? https://caddyserver.com/download
Feb 21 22:51:01 <velix>	Not a single word, which version you're downloading.
Feb 21 22:51:35 <velix>	Seems like the Caddyfile format changed again :D
Feb 21 22:51:54 <neoncortex>	version?  You download the last one, and thats that!
Feb 21 22:51:59 <velix>	;)
Feb 21 22:52:08 <velix>	neoncortex: I like you ;)
Feb 21 22:52:25 <neoncortex>	I like you, too, you are my linux bro.
Feb 21 22:52:38 <korn3r>	i just installed Gimp on rocky linux and it installed me an "unstable version". Thats strange, lol. Funny splash screen it has tho
Feb 21 22:53:02 <velix>	korn3r: at least they don't promise anything.
Feb 21 22:53:28 <velix>	My Corel X7 crashed about 3 times in 6 years.
Feb 21 22:53:28 <korn3r>	who are those "they" you talking about?
Feb 21 22:53:38 <velix>	korn3r: the makers of Gimp.
Feb 21 22:53:53 <velix>	you can't blame them for crashes when they [makers of Gimp] say it's instable.
Feb 21 22:53:58 <ananke>	yes, the lack of version on the download page is the epitomy of 'suck' when it comes to software. life must be so difficult for you
Feb 21 22:54:32 <korn3r>	i dont blame anyone, im just surprised rhel-based distro has unstable version in default repos
Feb 21 22:54:53 <velix>	ananke: you're not working in a professional environment, are you?
Feb 21 22:55:09 <ananke>	velix: I love when you make false assumptions
Feb 21 22:55:45 <velix>	ananke: I need to document the version... I hate to download it first and hope it has --version
Feb 21 22:56:51 <ananke>	velix: yet you decide to use this channel as a complaint dumpster. go file an issue with caddy
Feb 21 22:56:52 <akk>	might be the python2/pygtk problem, distros have stopped shipping that which makes the stable gimp version a lot less functional
Feb 21 22:58:54 <rocks>	Sounds like DevOps
Feb 21 22:59:07 <rocks>	Who needs compatibility when you can just use the latest version of everything
Feb 21 22:59:18 <velix>	ananke: Have you ever done an anger management course?
Feb 21 22:59:45 <ananke>	velix: have you? you seem to be getting quite emotional over a small issue
Feb 21 23:00:12 <bombastick>	ananke: you';re being very sus here...I bet you dont version your software either. Repent!
Feb 21 23:00:15 <Armand>	Get a room.
Feb 21 23:00:39 <velix>	Armand: Indeed, my garbage dump stinks too much for me. Good night.
Feb 21 23:01:02 <korn3r>	akk: maybe... but compiling "dev" version into rpm is strange to me. it even has version 2.99, while latest stable is 2.10 xD
Feb 21 23:01:17 <neoncortex>	it does still comes with gtk2?
Feb 21 23:01:31 <ananke>	bombastick: it's not about software versions, because that problem is actually easily solved. it's about bitching and complaining, rather than asking a normal question like 'how do I download specific version of caddy server', to which there's actually a perfectly normal answer

Feb 21 23:22:00 <Pikk3wyn>	it's chilled tho, its not like its for work
Feb 21 23:23:37 <n4dir>	let me first ask the guy what he wants. If he can't live with a WM, i'll go for MX. Could get it down to 400 MB usage, and on a 4 Gig laptop that should be fine
Feb 21 23:24:49 <nvz>	i just used debian on a 4gb atom piece of junk i setup for gaming for a kid and it worked fine
Feb 21 23:25:01 <nvz>	and used mate desktop no less
Feb 21 23:26:00 <nvz>	got buncha windows games running fine on there
Feb 21 23:26:04 <n4dir>	nvz: i haven't made up my mind yet. The guy knows nothing, and i am not sure if debian/devuan offer some of the automated stuff MX does
Feb 21 23:26:13 <n4dir>	i don't do such, so not good at configuring them
Feb 21 23:27:14 <nvz>	idk what sort of stuff youre referring to but for me its about setting up the machine as needed so they dont have to and using something thats stable and well supported and that i could support if need be
Feb 21 23:27:29 <Pikk3wyn>	n4dir: try linux mint maybe
Feb 21 23:27:48 <Pikk3wyn>	depends if they are intelligent
Feb 21 23:27:59 <nvz>	these days i am moving to using tailscale or headscale to make remote support options like x2godesktopsharing easier
Feb 21 23:28:05 <n4dir>	Pikk3wyn: the guy in charge for the old laptops is a Mint fan. It is not too easy on ressources
Feb 21 23:28:12 <Pikk3wyn>	some people i've introduced to linux ended up installing arch within 2 months or something
Feb 21 23:28:13 <n4dir>	Pikk3wyn: i already downloaded it anyway
Feb 21 23:28:19 <Pikk3wyn>	n4dir: that would be the DE
Feb 21 23:28:28 <Pikk3wyn>	you could try the xfce/lxde one
Feb 21 23:28:33 <n4dir>	and it is a pain in the butt to disable certain auto-things on Mint
Feb 21 23:28:46 <Pikk3wyn>	such as?
Feb 21 23:28:47 <r1911>	n4dir: hi!
Feb 21 23:29:17 <n4dir>	Pikk3wyn: Mint seems to use 800 MB after log in, MX used 470, and i got it down to under 400 in the blink of an eye
Feb 21 23:29:27 <Pikk3wyn>	n4dir: that's the DE
Feb 21 23:29:30 <Pikk3wyn>	what DE
Feb 21 23:29:31 <n4dir>	Mint ise heavy, depending on your hardware
Feb 21 23:29:35 <n4dir>	xfce
Feb 21 23:29:40 <nvz>	i havent setup headscale yet so im using tailscale currently
Feb 21 23:29:46 <Pikk3wyn>	it's all setup dependent
Feb 21 23:29:46 <n4dir>	antix used 130. lol
Feb 21 23:29:51 <Pikk3wyn>	did you check what is using the ram?
Feb 21 23:29:54 <r1911>	n4dir: i've almost got my audio stuffs running but not 100%
Feb 21 23:30:03 <Pikk3wyn>	pipewire?
Feb 21 23:30:07 <n4dir>	Pikk3wyn: yes, and as said, that is a real pain in Mint. They autostart things from all over the place
Feb 21 23:30:16 <n4dir>	r1911: nice
Feb 21 23:30:27 <n4dir>	Pikk3wyn: MX used pipewire, antix i didn't check
Feb 21 23:30:52 <Pikk3wyn>	it's easy to disable
Feb 21 23:31:11 <Pikk3wyn>	why not give him endevouros with fluxbox or something
Feb 21 23:31:17 <n4dir>	I mean, if i have to spend 4 days to go down with ressource usage on Mint, i might just as well start with debian and configure the few auto-things myself
Feb 21 23:31:30 <n4dir>	in a few hours
Feb 21 23:32:31 <rocks>	What sort of a newer computer will 4 days pay buy you on eBay?
Feb 21 23:32:41 <neoncortex>	yeah, I think in that lxde is king on resource usage.  To go lighter, you need to use a wm only.
Feb 21 23:32:41 <Pikk3wyn>	arch with a WM should use well less than 100mb of ram
Feb 21 23:32:53 <Pikk3wyn>	hell, you can probably get it down to 20 on a barebones system
Feb 21 23:33:05 <Armand>	rocks: None.. I don't buy prebuilt garbage, especially SH.
Feb 21 23:33:05 <n4dir>	so would debian
Feb 21 23:33:12 <neoncortex>	and then you load a gtk/qt program.
Feb 21 23:33:18 <Pikk3wyn>	neoncortex: hehe
Feb 21 23:33:19 <n4dir>	well, not less than 100, but around 100
Feb 21 23:34:10 <n4dir>	as said, antix, out of box, 130
Feb 21 23:34:34 <Pikk3wyn>	it's all down to config mainly
Feb 21 23:34:55 <Pikk3wyn>	the heavier debian distros will be ofc more difficult to streamline
Feb 21 23:34:57 <n4dir>	out of box is out of box
Feb 21 23:35:06 <Pikk3wyn>	why not just start with arch out of the box
Feb 21 23:35:12 <n4dir>	why would i?
Feb 21 23:35:15 <Pikk3wyn>	probably uses about 1mb of ram in the tty lmao
Feb 21 23:35:28 <Pikk3wyn>	i forgot even we have an install script now
Feb 21 23:35:47 <Pikk3wyn>	n4dir: you want best performance
Feb 21 23:36:10 <n4dir>	i got performance well good enough
Feb 21 23:36:31 <neoncortex>	does antix use gnu libc?
Feb 21 23:36:36 <n4dir>	yup
Feb 21 23:45:33 <bparker>	22:33 < Armand> rocks: None.. I don't buy prebuilt garbage, especially SH.
Feb 21 23:45:35 <bparker>	do we really need to be so abrasive?
Feb 21 23:45:48 <rocks>	I always make my own laptops from components
Feb 21 23:46:04 <rocks>	/s, in case it's necessary
Feb 21 23:46:13 <bparker>	:)
Feb 21 23:46:15 <Armand>	I mean, that is a thing... lol
Feb 21 23:46:21 <rocks>	rofl!
Feb 21 23:46:26 <n4dir>	i just take whatever gets in my way
Feb 21 23:46:27 <rocks>	Where can you get laptop parts?
Feb 21 23:46:29 <bparker>	I know they weren't talking about building a framework laptop or such
Feb 21 23:46:34 <n4dir>	the more shitty, the better
Feb 21 23:46:37 <Armand>	eBay... lol
Feb 21 23:46:42 <bparker>	language
Feb 21 23:46:49 <Armand>	Depends on what you're looking for, obvs. :)

Feb 21 23:54:38 <jb1277976>	trying to get sound working on nixos and im suppose to put this https://dpaste.org/4MXkW in configuration.nix can somebody tell me what it does and why does it error out after 4 hours ?
Feb 21 23:55:51 <Elw3>	bacotera is terrible on the pi
Feb 21 23:55:57 <Elw3>	atd least it boots

Feb 21 23:59:06 <nvz>	jb1277976: I think thats a question more appropriate for a nixos channel, its a very convoluted distro-specific kinda thing
Feb 22 00:00:28 <nvz>	jb1277976: personally, I'd be asking myself a more important question of why I'm using such an OS to begin with
Feb 22 00:00:57 <jb1277976>	dam!
Feb 22 00:01:11 <undeadivory>	hi
Feb 22 00:01:19 <wigums>	maybe because they want to
Feb 22 00:01:51 <ssm_>	nixos bad! nixos is the new systemd! nixos declared harmful! netcraft confirms: nixos is dying!
Feb 22 00:01:59 <nvz>	wigums: people do a lot of things for that reason, and often don't realize what they /want/ isn't what they /need/
Feb 22 00:02:22 <wigums>	nvz some people are just hobbyists tho
Feb 22 00:02:35 <wigums>	and thus do things because they want to
Feb 22 00:02:40 <Armand>	ssm_: You need a "/s" to follow that
Feb 22 00:02:44 <ssm_>	I hate /s
Feb 22 00:02:48 <Armand>	Good.
Feb 22 00:02:55 <ssm_>	if I need /s, my joke sucks
Feb 22 00:03:04 <ssm_>	or the audience is wrong
Feb 22 00:03:07 <rocks>	Probabaly the only people using nixOS are hobbyists because no-one is mad enough to use it for things that pay bills
Feb 22 00:03:09 <nvz>	wigums: right, well.. if thats the case I'd still talk about it in #nixos where you are likely to find people who understand in detail their convoluted way of managing packages
Feb 22 00:03:16 <Armand>	It does suck, but that wasn't my point.
Feb 22 00:04:24 <nvz>	cause I have been using computers since the 80s and I've never once had to do something that odd just to get sound to work on anything ever... and its far from a general linux question
Feb 22 00:04:54 <nvz>	it would serve them and everyone else best to ask such questions in a more appropriate place
Feb 22 00:05:37 <nvz>	those are my two best pieces of advice on the matter, ask those who know and use that system, or don't use that system
Feb 22 00:05:49 <Pikk3wyn>	lmao it's straight alsa? not even pipewire?
Feb 22 00:05:58 <Pikk3wyn>	youre using alsa and wonder why you have issues? ;)
Feb 22 00:06:02 <ssm_>	I mean, nixOS IS linux. if we're going to discriminate there, we should also discriminate against everyone not using [init system] [rc manager] [filesystem] [etc]
Feb 22 00:06:03 <Pikk3wyn>	try ask the gentoo channel
Feb 22 00:06:05 <Pikk3wyn>	they love alsa
Feb 22 00:06:39 <Pikk3wyn>	jb1277976: you didn't give the error so there isn;t info
Feb 22 00:07:07 <nvz>	ssm_: its not about discrimination its about the nature of the question, if they had questions about the kernel, vfs, shell scripting, gnu tools, etc.. that'd be one thing.. they're asking about snippets of code for a very complicated package management scheme not used by anything but one distro that has a channel right next door..
Feb 22 00:07:37 <ssm_>	that's extremely normal though, people have domain-specific problems in linux all the time we help with
Feb 22 00:07:44 <nvz>	the question in and of itself was trivially vague, and only mentioned things relevant to #nixos
Feb 22 00:08:15 <ssm_>	I don't even like nixos why am I defending this lmao
Feb 22 00:08:30 <rocks>	roflcopter
Feb 22 00:08:36 <ssm_>	soisoisoisoisoi
Feb 22 00:09:06 <nvz>	ssm_: heh.. cause you're a bored "nerd" on irc, same reason we're all having this conversation :P
Feb 22 00:09:14 <ssm_>	yeah :>
Feb 22 00:10:28 <nvz>	I'd like to help, I just can't and I'm not gonna sit there and pry details out and learn about a system I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole to do so, just so somene can address a trivial problem on something they are only toying with out of curiosity, when they can just go ask the people who use/understand it in another channel
Feb 22 00:11:20 <Pikk3wyn>	hehe
Feb 22 00:11:26 <ananke>	nvz: yet you have enough time and energy to write an essay about how much you don't want to do it
Feb 22 00:11:29 <nvz>	all I can gather is, they're setting up some alsa ucm crap from some possibly random repo from god knows whos advice
Feb 22 00:11:38 <nvz>	ananke: that is well within my capabilities
Feb 22 00:12:00 <ananke>	it wasn't a question of capabilities, rather priorities
Feb 22 00:12:10 <ssm_>	this is why I go on irc
Feb 22 00:12:15 <nvz>	heh
Feb 22 00:12:35 <Pikk3wyn>	my take on the audio stuation is 'whoever told you to do it like that was wrong, use pipewire'
Feb 22 00:12:47 <Pikk3wyn>	'read pipewire doc for your distro and install'
Feb 22 00:12:51 <ssm_>	no! use sndio!
Feb 22 00:13:00 <Pikk3wyn>	OSS!
Feb 22 00:13:13 <MacGyver>	beep!
Feb 22 00:13:16 <nvz>	Pikk3wyn: yeah, pretty much.. there are better ways is often the answer
Feb 22 00:14:44 *	nvz is feeling vaguely hangry and goes to get some turd forming substrate
Feb 22 00:15:09 <ssm_>	pulseaudio just kind of works nowadays, haven't had to pulseaudio -k a single time in recent memory
Feb 22 00:15:29 <Pikk3wyn>	probably because it's using pipewire under the hood now
Feb 22 00:15:35 <Pikk3wyn>	with a pulse shim
Feb 22 00:15:51 <ssm_>	lennart in shambles?
Feb 22 00:15:52 <Pikk3wyn>	pulseaudio isn't even pulseaudio anymore :P
Feb 22 00:15:56 <Pikk3wyn>	and thank god for that
Feb 22 00:17:51 <ssm_>	finally, linux audio isn't hell, I thought I would never see the day
Feb 22 00:18:27 <bparker>	lol
Feb 22 00:18:55 <n4dir>	i will wait for the next soundserver. integrating alsa, jack, pulse and pipewire
Feb 22 00:19:02 <ssm_>	openal?
Feb 22 00:19:09 <ssm_>	not a sound server I guess
Feb 22 00:19:56 <Pikk3wyn>	n4dir: it already exists lmao
Feb 22 00:20:00 <Pikk3wyn>	it's called pipewire
Feb 22 00:20:09 <Pikk3wyn>	pipewire-jack, pipewire-pulse, etc
Feb 22 00:21:01 <n4dir>	Pikk3wyn: no, i meant the next level. Something which integrates all of that and ingegrates pipewire.
Feb 22 00:21:04 <n4dir>	that was the whole joke
Feb 22 00:21:25 <n4dir>	who wouldn't want to run 5 audiosystems
Feb 22 00:22:11 <Pikk3wyn>	haha
Feb 22 00:22:23 <n4dir>	i can't see why we should stop now
Feb 22 00:23:35 <n4dir>	Pikk3wyn: is there something for pipewire like qjackctl for jack?
Feb 22 00:24:17 <Pikk3wyn>	there is some super nifty advanced thing that lets you swap the individual streams around and redirect stuff etc
Feb 22 00:24:21 <Pikk3wyn>	i forget what its called
Feb 22 00:24:29 <uwharrie>	you should technically be able to continue using pulse or jack tooling if you've got the pulse and jack API shims for pipewire installed
Feb 22 00:24:34 <Pikk3wyn>	i think very fwe things use pipewire directly
Feb 22 00:24:42 <n4dir>	where you patch stuff, like catia does for jack?
Feb 22 00:24:43 <velix>	Anyone with an idea why this happens? https://bpa.st/raw/MHRQ
Feb 22 00:25:27 <Pikk3wyn>	you can use qjackctl with pipewire
Feb 22 00:25:39 <n4dir>	http://0x0.st/H5TA.png
Feb 22 00:25:56 <rocks>	velix: If the directory already exists, the second link ends up inside it
Feb 22 00:26:04 <n4dir>	that i found for pipewire, but not something to kinda configure it, say choose soundcard
Feb 22 00:26:05 <Pikk3wyn>	n4dir: ja there is something almost identical to that
Feb 22 00:26:12 <n4dir>	yup, that i found
Feb 22 00:26:24 <Pikk3wyn>	i think very few things use pipewire directly
Feb 22 00:26:29 <n4dir>	forgot the name, but google finds it quickly
Feb 22 00:26:34 <Pikk3wyn>	only thing i seen with an option for it was obs i think?"
Feb 22 00:26:46 <Pikk3wyn>	or some music program i forget
Feb 22 00:26:49 <n4dir>	Pikk3wyn: but how you choose the soundcard? for example? buffer and stuff?
Feb 22 00:27:05 <Liver_K>	Hey, does anybody know if (gnu) emacs requires the Meta keysym names to be assigned to the first kysym slots of the meta keycodes?
Feb 22 00:27:08 <velix>	rocks: But "-f" says `remove existing destination files`
Feb 22 00:27:20 <n4dir>	i'd prefer sticking to jack, but it seems all distros switch to pipewire
Feb 22 00:27:27 <rocks>	There's a special case when it's a directory, in case you mean to replace a link inside a directory
Feb 22 00:27:39 <velix>	rocks: meh...
Feb 22 00:27:40 <rocks>	The only solution is to unlink if the target is a directory and recreate
Feb 22 00:27:45 <velix>	yeah :(
Feb 22 00:27:47 <velix>	thanks :(
Feb 22 00:28:26 <Pikk3wyn>	n4dir: you can adjust the buffers in /etc/pipewire.d
Feb 22 00:28:38 <n4dir>	Pikk3wyn: ah, ok. thanks
Feb 22 00:29:41 <n4dir>	probably when i have to it is back to arch wiki ...
Feb 22 00:30:05 <MacGyver>	The pipewire wiki is pretty good.
Feb 22 00:30:12 <n4dir>	MacGyver: thanks
Feb 22 00:30:23 <MacGyver>	To the point the archwiki won't need to duplicate it.
Feb 22 00:30:43 <MacGyver>	There's a few migration guides on there; can't attest to the quality of the jack migration though.
Feb 22 00:31:40 <n4dir>	i am not too sure if that many audio-programs can be configured to use pipewire. Probably have to run jack
Feb 22 00:32:32 <velix>	rocks: `ln -fsn 01-apps/jdk-11.0.22+7/ java` <-- actually works, but keeps an unreferenced "old version". so I don't save a "rm" ;)
Feb 22 00:33:13 <oerheks>	old, like ubuntu foxal?
Feb 22 00:33:27 <oerheks>	err/focal
Feb 22 00:33:51 <velix>	I really hope debian and ubuntu will switch to version numbers in future :)
Feb 22 00:34:12 <jb1277976>	nvz i'm not going that route again. i'm going to try something else. that error took 4 hours lol i forgot it
Feb 22 00:34:15 <JanC>	they already have version numbers
Feb 22 00:34:30 <velix>	JanC: Sure, but as "main" name.
Feb 22 00:34:38 <velix>	JanC: Nobody says "Windows Memphis".
Feb 22 00:34:40 <uwharrie>	don't need to reconfigure or redevelop anything if you've got the compat layers installed
Feb 22 00:34:44 <velix>	"Windows Longhorn"
Feb 22 00:34:48 <velix>	"Windows Chicago"
Feb 22 00:34:57 <JanC>	nobody uses Windows version numbers either
Feb 22 00:35:04 <velix>	Win 7, Win 10, Win 11
Feb 22 00:35:12 <JanC>	no, those are marketing names
Feb 22 00:35:12 <ssm_>	"Win dows the os becomes usable"
Feb 22 00:35:20 <JanC>	they are not the real version numbers
Feb 22 00:35:30 <velix>	JanC: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.4046]
Feb 22 00:35:37 <velix>	current upgrade.
Feb 22 00:37:13 <JanC>	velix: Windows 11 is also 10.x
Feb 22 00:37:32 <voldial>	I'm on 6.7.3 with 64GB ram. Should I expect /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches to default to something greater than (my current) 8192? Looking at https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/notify/inotify/inotify_user.c#L841 it seems that it should be dynamically calculated on boot?
Feb 22 00:37:40 <JanC>	see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT#Releases
Feb 22 00:37:54 <oerheks>	good thing win7/8 machines are widely available, cheap
Feb 22 00:38:33 <velix>	JanC: oh okay, I don't have the money for Windows 11. But at least the marketing names are sortable ;)
Feb 22 00:39:29 <JanC>	well, not really, considering the server ones in between & random names like 2000, XP & Vista, etc.
Feb 22 00:39:37 <velix>	JanC: No need to sort them anymore.
Feb 22 00:40:04 <ssm_>	velix: I don't think anyone buys windows anymore, M$ is more than happy just mining your personal information to sell to advertisers instead
Feb 22 00:40:10 <NeXeN>	hmm cubase LE 4 works flawlessly in wine except a little flicker on the floating panel thingy....hrmm i think my video card is janky anyways, I see flicker in random other stuff
Feb 22 00:40:26 <Liver_K>	This channel is too busy for questions to not get whisked away in the scrollback ;_;
Feb 22 00:40:46 <MacGyver>	That's IRC.
Feb 22 00:40:53 <oerheks>	♥
Feb 22 00:40:54 <ssm_>	or no one knows the solution to your problem
Feb 22 00:41:01 <Liver_K>	Fair enough
Feb 22 00:41:03 <velix>	ssm_: I've made a lot of money by catching commercial dealers selling pirated copies of Microsoft on ebay. I paid Ikea Pax from it.
Feb 22 00:41:29 <rocks>	Or the question made no sense
Feb 22 00:43:08 <Pikk3wyn>	can i haz pirated copy of microsoft?!?!
Feb 22 00:43:25 <korn3r>	i dont mind
Feb 22 00:43:37 <Pikk3wyn>	how are to pirate microsoft?
Feb 22 00:43:58 *	NeXeN sends microsoft "Clippy" with the Pirate theme to Pikk3wyn 
Feb 22 00:44:01 <oerheks>	Pikk3wyn, you do not have to, you can download legally
Feb 22 00:44:08 *	ssm_ DCC's Pikk3wyn the warez
Feb 22 00:44:19 <Pikk3wyn>	voldial: i've got 64gb and mine is 524288
Feb 22 00:44:26 <JanC>	velix: also, you can actually sort codenames for Ubuntu releases: jammy, kinetic, lunar, mantic, noble (and in a couple months o... will be added)
Feb 22 00:44:37 *	Pikk3wyn receives wares over dcc at 56k
Feb 22 00:44:37 <oerheks>	https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
Feb 22 00:44:44 <oerheks>	it is freeware, man
Feb 22 00:44:54 <JanC>	more like spyware
Feb 22 00:44:56 <NeXeN>	vapourware
Feb 22 00:45:04 <Pikk3wyn>	oerheks: you'd have to pay me to use it
Feb 22 00:45:20 <oerheks>	Pikk3wyn, dm your bitcoin wallet
Feb 22 00:45:34 <Pikk3wyn>	lmao what is that file
Feb 22 00:45:39 <oerheks>	https://popey.com/blog/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-490k-swindle/
Feb 22 00:46:15 <rocks>	That's what you get for using craptocurrency
Feb 22 00:46:26 <Pikk3wyn>	i dont have my NAt open lol\
Feb 22 00:46:33 <oerheks>	oh dear
Feb 22 00:48:25 <voldial>	Pikk3wyn: hmph. Thanks. I'll keep digging around... maybe something is setting it
Feb 22 00:50:01 <Pikk3wyn>	it's not calculated automatically i think
Feb 22 00:50:11 <Pikk3wyn>	8192 is the default
Feb 22 00:50:20 <Pikk3wyn>	it has been for years
Feb 22 00:50:51 <Pikk3wyn>	either arch pkg config or linux-zen is responsible for the increased value on mine
Feb 22 00:51:12 <JanC>	it's probably what you get for testing a random app with half a million dollars
Feb 22 00:52:14 <oerheks>	worst event for snaps, i guess
Feb 22 00:52:21 <oerheks>	but again, buttcoim
Feb 22 00:54:15 <MacGyver>	I've got 64GiB and mine is also 524288. It's being set by /usr/lib/sysctl.d/10-arch.conf, owned by the filesystem package.
Feb 22 00:55:21 <MacGyver>	That file only has two lines, one setting max_user_instances to 1024 and one setting max_user_watches to 524288.
Feb 22 00:55:34 <MacGyver>	Since arch is loathe to override defaults, there's probably a historically good reason for it.

Feb 22 00:58:26 <MacGyver>	Looks like the context was https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/47830
Feb 22 00:58:55 <MacGyver>	voldial: ^
Feb 22 01:00:38 <voldial>	MacGyver: ah, TY. I'm on gentoo, but I bet it's getting set in etc... looking
Feb 22 01:01:11 <MacGyver>	voldial: The linked issue also implies it's *not* dynamic, or at least, wasn't in 2018.
Feb 22 01:02:33 <uwharrie>	looks like the max is dynamic but distinct from the default
Feb 22 01:05:15 <Pikk3wyn>	night everyone
Feb 22 01:05:17 <Pikk3wyn>	sleep well :)
Feb 22 01:06:48 <rocks>	People are loath to spel loath correctly
Feb 22 01:07:06 <kfrench>	loathers gonna loath
Feb 22 01:07:16 <rocks>	Word
Feb 22 01:07:54 <MacGyver>	Loaf.
Feb 22 01:09:04 <MacGyver>	voldial: I wonder whether that computation overflows.
Feb 22 01:09:40 *	kfrench stuffs bread in MacGyver's blinds.
Feb 22 01:09:42 <MacGyver>	voldial: Because if nothing is setting it, it's being clamped to the *low* value for you.
Feb 22 01:10:38 <MacGyver>	voldial: But that makes no sense, because everything should be 64-bit numbers there.
Feb 22 01:10:52 <Siecje>	Where is this?
Feb 22 01:11:05 <MacGyver>	Siecje: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/92890123749bafc317bbfacbe0a62ce08d78efb7
Feb 22 01:11:24 <uwharrie>	it's the max, being the max doesn't imply it's going to be the default or the current
Feb 22 01:12:16 <uwharrie>	similar to the way the limits system works
Feb 22 01:16:12 <korn3r>	any rhel9 users? how do i get access to repos on that thing?
Feb 22 01:16:48 <rbox>	korn3r: talk to red hat
Feb 22 01:16:49 <rbox>	lol
Feb 22 01:17:10 <ssm_>	korn3r: don't and won't use ibm distros, but I would look at how rocky gets their source code, or just copy from them
Feb 22 01:17:20 <ssm_>	as far as I can tell that's where most of the effort would go into getting that stuff
Feb 22 01:19:40 <ssm_>	assuming rhel has gone fully closed source, I wouldn't trust that source code after some time anyways and would just use rocky's
Feb 22 01:19:59 <Armand>	It hasn't.
Feb 22 01:20:43 <Armand>	They've merely proven themselves to be untrustworthy by gating.
Feb 22 01:23:16 <rocks>	Access to which repos?
Feb 22 01:23:35 <rbox>	rocks: you're a repo
Feb 22 01:23:43 <rocks>	Guilty as charge your honour
Feb 22 01:24:19 <Armand>	Plea accepted, charges dismissed.. Get out of my courtroom!
Feb 22 01:24:32 <rocks>	You can sign up for a developer subscription for RHEL, at which point you should be able to register a system and download packages. There's not going to be an open HTTP server you can just grab stuff from
Feb 22 01:25:03 <Armand>	"gating"

Feb 22 01:27:06 <jb1277976>	using pipewire in pavucontrol it shows a pro audio profile. when i select it i have like 5 profiles and profile 5 works for speakers but the microphone dosen't work. also when i plug in headphones it works just not the built in micrphone for the headphones. how can i fix that ? running nixos
Feb 22 01:27:12 <jb1277976>	happend on freebsd also
Feb 22 01:27:58 <MacGyver>	jb1277976: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/wikis/FAQ#what-is-the-pro-audio-profile
Feb 22 01:28:14 <MacGyver>	jb1277976: The answer is, if you have to ask, you probably don't want the pro profile.
Feb 22 01:28:33 <jb1277976>	MacGyver i know. but thats the only way i can get sound
Feb 22 01:28:51 <MacGyver>	Now *that* is the interesting problem.
Feb 22 01:28:55 <jb1277976>	all i get is dummy ouput
Feb 22 01:28:59 <MacGyver>	It shows no other profiles?
Feb 22 01:29:13 <jb1277976>	yea like micrphone and some others but they say unplugged

Feb 22 01:34:43 *	rocks wonders why you'd need a brazilian butt lift for that
Feb 22 01:34:52 <Random6>	Hello everyone
Feb 22 01:34:58 <nvz>	o/
Feb 22 01:37:09 <nvz>	rocks: took me a good 3 minutes to get that joke
Feb 22 01:43:51 <NyB>	hmm... English should introduce parentheses for precedence. (brazilian butt) lift != brazilian (butt lift).
Feb 22 01:46:03 <rocks>	We have hyphens for that, although it only deals with one level of associativity
Feb 22 01:46:06 <NyB>	not to be confused with the more niche brazilian ((brazilian butt) lift)
Feb 22 01:47:37 <NyB>	rocks: I vaguely remember the editor of some academic publication advising against the use of associativity hyphens, but I can't remember which one, so I could be totally wrong...
Feb 22 01:47:46 <NyB>	or it might be a US vs UK English thing...
Feb 22 01:48:03 <rocks>	UK #1
Feb 22 01:48:11 <JanC>	it's probably better to rephrase when something is ambiguous
Feb 22 01:50:52 <NyB>	I love it when a thing says in the online specs "up to 25 kg per shelf" and in the manual "up to 20kg per shelf"
Feb 22 01:51:26 <NyB>	realistically speaking, it would be a horrifically bad design if anything happened with 25 or 30 or even 35 kg of load
Feb 22 01:53:13 <rocks>	Safety factor: 0.8

Feb 22 02:06:57 *	rocks hears creaking
Feb 22 02:08:45 <t4nk_fn>	suppose... just suppose.. I wanted to check out some repo on github.. but, for fun's sake, and maybe simplicity, I wanted to build it from the first commit ever
Feb 22 02:09:01 <t4nk_fn>	which used Qt4
Feb 22 02:09:38 <t4nk_fn>	and presumably gcc and such needed to be from the same time period too
Feb 22 02:10:20 <t4nk_fn>	what would my options be? I'm thinking of setting up some virtual machine perhaps, but are there iso images around I could download for that?
Feb 22 02:10:27 <rocks>	Newer compilers should be fine with older code, although you may need to turn off some flags to shut up warnings and errors
Feb 22 02:10:36 <rbox>	t4nk_fn: docker
Feb 22 02:10:45 <rocks>	You'll need to build all the dependencies though, which may be significant
Feb 22 02:11:12 <phogg>	t4nk_fn: the easiest option is to install an old distro. Debian, for example, makes all old packages available in its snapshot repos. You can install it fresh, perhaps in a container.
Feb 22 02:12:31 <t4nk_fn>	phogg, it does? because I was thinking of that, but from what I thought was experience (with kubuntu) I believed that all hell would break loose if I needed to install some additional stuff
Feb 22 02:12:37 <rocks>	It's a lot of work for a busted-ass old version of something which has been improved in the meantime
Feb 22 02:12:41 <t4nk_fn>	I've been using gentoo for the longest time now
Feb 22 02:12:49 <rascul>	find a distro from the year or the year before the first commit
Feb 22 02:12:51 <phogg>	t4nk_fn: debian is pretty self-contained
Feb 22 02:12:55 <JanC>	NyB: also depends on how that weight is applied to the shelf...
Feb 22 02:13:24 <rascul>	if you can determine what distro they used or what family of distros that can help a lot
Feb 22 02:13:36 <phogg>	t4nk_fn: http://snapshot.debian.org if you're interested. But rbox is right, try current compilers first.
Feb 22 02:15:11 <superkuh>	Ubuntu has http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ for old versions. Works for Ubuntu 10.04 just fine.
Feb 22 02:15:23 <superkuh>	(as the repo base)
Feb 22 02:15:29 <phogg>	I imagine most distros have an equivalent
Feb 22 02:15:44 <t4nk_fn>	yeah, I've been messing around by trying to change it to use qt5 .. but there's a whole lot of error messages popping up concerning that (not that I'm too versed at compiler errors) so hence I thought it would be easier to go back in time with a vm
Feb 22 02:16:30 <t4nk_fn>	and rocks ... yes, a whole lot of trouble, lol.. but I'm really doing this to be able to better understand the basics of the program
Feb 22 02:16:44 <t4nk_fn>	it's pulseview btw, libsigrok
Feb 22 02:19:50 <rocks>	Have they just abandoned it without there being a more modern equivalent, or are their other users still running 10 year old OS?
Feb 22 02:20:49 <NeilRG>	is it possible to make neovim (or vim) my pager for the kitty terminal?
Feb 22 02:21:05 <NeilRG>	I tried export PAGER=nvim, but it didn't do anything ?
Feb 22 02:21:22 <t4nk_fn>	the project is still alive-ish, but the people working on it can be counted on 1 finger
Feb 22 02:22:17 <t4nk_fn>	it's a really nice project though, I like it a lot
Feb 22 02:23:44 <phogg>	NeilRG: I am no vi user, but I thought some switch would be required
Feb 22 02:25:05 <NeilRG>	phogg, okay thanks I think I found it
Feb 22 02:28:33 <espresso>	for posterity, https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Neovim#Use_as_a_pager seems to document some options
Feb 22 02:32:14 <espresso>	[hard crash] so compiling firefox-esr does gobble up some ram.. i'll best do it without other ram-intensive things

Feb 22 02:46:40 <Random6>	Has anyone ever managed to get Bethesda games running on Linux?
Feb 22 02:46:51 <Random6>	IF that can be done, I will delete windows 11 entirely.
Feb 22 02:46:53 <Disconsented>	https://www.protondb.com/
Feb 22 02:47:20 <Random6>	I tried that with steam and had no luck... Perhaps I did something wrong
Feb 22 02:48:18 <Disconsented>	What game are you talking about specifically?
Feb 22 02:58:52 <espresso>	Random6: short answer is 'yes', https://www.protondb.com/search?q=Skyrim (but I think a recent wine can often stand in for proton?) -- this fellow explains in minutes how he configured Skyrim https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOkqTEGjIMs , Fallout 3+4, and others
Feb 22 02:59:57 <Random6>	Awome
Feb 22 03:00:08 <Random6>	Awesome*. I will revisit that endeavor someday
Feb 22 03:00:12 <Disconsented>	Random6> https://www.protondb.com/
Feb 22 03:00:53 <Random6>	I liked playing left for dead 2 on linux
Feb 22 03:04:31 <espresso>	Baldur's Gate 3 ran better here than on a friend's Windows machine, though sometimes Vulkan/nvidia were to blame there. For DirectX stuff, dxvk (DirectX -> Vulkan compiler)
Feb 22 03:07:55 <Khaytsus>	Would I like native Linux games?  Sure, I bought quite a few in the past..  Unreal Tournament 99, 2004, Quake 3, a few others..  but Steam with Proton just seems to work.
Feb 22 03:08:27 <rbox>	Khaytsus: you're a native game
Feb 22 03:08:57 <Disconsented>	Honestly with how good proton is I dont really care about native games
Feb 22 03:09:52 <Khaytsus>	I've only played Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered in it, but it's flawless.  No idea about what a big AAA game or whatnot would do.
Feb 22 03:10:17 <Soni>	what's the best way to setup LVM on cloud storage
Feb 22 03:10:30 <phogg>	same way you set up lvm anywhere
Feb 22 03:10:44 <Soni>	SSHFS? SMB? WebDAV?
Feb 22 03:10:53 <phogg>	what do those have to do with LVM?
Feb 22 03:10:57 <ananke>	'cloud storage'? that's not a concrete technology
Feb 22 03:11:01 <Soni>	no those have to do with cloud storage
Feb 22 03:11:24 <phogg>	if you mean "lvm on a VM that is hosted by someone else" then it's the same as anywhere
Feb 22 03:11:26 <rbox>	what do any of that have to od with lvm?
Feb 22 03:11:29 <rbox>	or the cloud
Feb 22 03:11:30 <ananke>	LVM deals with block devices. not sure what you think 'cloud storage' means
Feb 22 03:11:39 <phogg>	if you mean "LVM on top of object storage" then you can't really do that
Feb 22 03:11:46 <Soni>	cloud storage is cloud storage, block devices is block devices yes these are different
Feb 22 03:11:58 <Soni>	how do you impedance match between them
Feb 22 03:12:02 <ananke>	Soni: 'cloud storage' is a non descript term
Feb 22 03:12:12 <phogg>	Soni: cloud storage is not a thing. If you mean S3 and similar systems, those are object storage.
Feb 22 03:12:13 <ananke>	Soni: it means nothing
Feb 22 03:12:13 *	rbox stores ananke in his cloud
Feb 22 03:12:16 <Khaytsus>	Soni: Restate what you actually want to do
Feb 22 03:12:23 <Soni>	what is a hetzner storage box
Feb 22 03:12:58 <ananke>	Soni: point to actual example of said 'cloud storage'
Feb 22 03:13:21 <Soni>	ananke: google drive?
Feb 22 03:13:32 <ananke>	Soni: is that a question or a statement?
Feb 22 03:14:02 <ananke>	Soni: regardless, the answer is no. it's not a block storage device.
Feb 22 03:14:10 <Soni>	the goal is to use dm-crypt to backup around 1TB of failing hard drives
Feb 22 03:14:20 <phogg>	Soni: google drive uses a custom protocol devised by google, and it's object storage
Feb 22 03:14:50 <Soni>	(encrypting your backups is important)
Feb 22 03:14:54 <phogg>	Soni: having just looked up "hetzner storage box", it looks like they make you a VM with some VM-local block devices, then run various daemons to share it out. Like a NAS hosted over the internet.
Feb 22 03:15:00 <espresso>	in wine, most things tend to be smooth sailing once finding the wine workarounds (DLLOVERRIDES) and deps. But native games do tend to be flawless. X4 is gorgeous.
Feb 22 03:16:59 <Soni>	who actually cares about block storage vs object storage, you can convert between them, that's the whole point of filesystems and loop mounts is it not
Feb 22 03:17:00 <Khaytsus>	Soni: Local drives?  go get a new drive at the store or Amazon or whatever..  This random series of silly questions you could have already done it.
Feb 22 03:17:21 <Soni>	Khaytsus: time-sensitive, it's also 11 pm
Feb 22 03:17:50 <phogg>	Soni: you can't convert between them in a performant way, and *you* care because you asked about LVM and it only works with block devices.
Feb 22 03:18:25 <rascul>	don't objectify the blocks
Feb 22 03:19:24 <bparker>	TIL LSB 5.0 *requires* Qt 4.0
Feb 22 03:19:36 *	rbox encrypts rascul's blocks
Feb 22 03:19:39 <phogg>	bparker: huh
Feb 22 03:19:49 <Soni>	phogg: filesystems make your drives slow, yes, thanks for stating the obvious, but what's the most performant object storage API for emulating block devices on
Feb 22 03:19:53 <bparker>	https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_5.0.0/LSB-Common/LSB-Common/requirements.html#RLIBRARIES
Feb 22 03:20:26 <phogg>	bparker: I believe you, but it's surprising
Feb 22 03:20:41 <phogg>	Soni: filesystems do not make drives slow. Where did you get that idea?
Feb 22 03:20:59 <bparker>	although it doesn't say the library itself has to actually BE 4.x, it just says the *name* must be Qt*.so.4
Feb 22 03:21:04 <Armand>	phogg: Baseless conjecture and guesswork.
Feb 22 03:21:14 <Soni>	phogg: benchmarkers have to actively bypass the filesystem when benchmarking the disk
Feb 22 03:21:24 <phogg>	Soni: no, they don't
Feb 22 03:21:33 *	bparker gets the popcorn
Feb 22 03:21:40 <Soni>	or else they're benchmarking the filesystem, not the disk
Feb 22 03:21:42 <Armand>	They definitely do not "have to".
Feb 22 03:22:05 <phogg>	Soni: benchmarkers who bypass the filesystem are interested in testing the *disk*, not the *filesystem*. That way the FS doesn't impact measurement of the disk. It's not because the FS is slow, it's just to eliminate variance.
Feb 22 03:22:47 <phogg>	Soni: benchmarkers also try to bypass kernel caching, but it's not because it's slow either. It just doesn't help in getting useful benchmarks
Feb 22 03:23:05 <bparker>	to be fair, if you're testing with a single file, with direct i/o, are you even using the filesystem at that point
Feb 22 03:23:39 <Soni>	anyway, a filesystem obviously has different performance characteristics than a disk, and in the best of cases it can only go as fast as the disk
Feb 22 03:24:00 <phogg>	Soni: So, with object storage there is no "most performant" way to make it the back end for block device emulation. All kinds of object storage will be about equally terrible. I recommend you do not attempt this. If you really want to you can find ways by googling; I can't recommend any because I don't use any.
Feb 22 03:24:08 <Soni>	there is a performance ceiling (the disk) but there is no floor, it can go infinitely slower
Feb 22 03:24:33 <bparker>	02:12 < phogg> Soni: cloud storage is not a thing.
Feb 22 03:24:35 <bparker>	and the sky is not blue
Feb 22 03:24:35 <Khaytsus>	Soni: Did you come here to argue with random people or get something done?
Feb 22 03:24:43 <phogg>	Soni: also untrue, a good filesystem can go faster than the disk by being clever.
Feb 22 03:25:10 <Soni>	phogg: okay sure, your filesystem can use RAM as the disk
Feb 22 03:25:11 <phogg>	bparker: "cloud storage" is not a kind of storage, it's a place for storage.
Feb 22 03:25:18 <bparker>	semantics
Feb 22 03:25:21 <Soni>	that's just a hybrid filesystem
Feb 22 03:25:22 <phogg>	Soni: all filesystems use RAM
Feb 22 03:25:32 <Armand>	Hahahaha
Feb 22 03:25:43 <bparker>	ok that's actually hilarious
Feb 22 03:25:45 <phogg>	bparker: for what he was asking it was being non-productive to use such an inexact term.
Feb 22 03:25:52 <bparker>	ly wrong
Feb 22 03:26:00 <Soni>	it*
Feb 22 03:26:14 <bparker>	phogg: tbf your comments are a lot less productive
Feb 22 03:26:26 <bparker>	all these hot takes most people do not agree with
Feb 22 03:26:33 <bparker>	just stirs more drama
Feb 22 03:26:35 <bparker>	can we not
Feb 22 03:26:36 <phogg>	Such as?
Feb 22 03:27:01 *	bparker backs away before he gets banned
Feb 22 03:27:07 <phogg>	hot takes like "a filesystem driver will use RAM"?
Feb 22 03:27:52 <phogg>	or "I can't recommend you try to use object storage to emulate a block device"?
Feb 22 03:28:35 <Soni>	where can you get 5TB of block device for 13 monthly euro
Feb 22 03:28:48 <Disconsented>	buyvm probably
Feb 22 03:29:01 <Armand>	O_o
Feb 22 03:29:16 <Armand>	You only pay for a drive once... just install it.
Feb 22 03:31:20 <bparker>	just install it, power it, bandwidth it, host it, maintain it, no big deal
Feb 22 03:31:43 <bparker>	surely you realize not everyone wants to do all that?
Feb 22 03:31:55 <bparker>	and don't think everyone's problems are solved by 'just doing it'
Feb 22 03:33:49 <bparker>	02:28 < Soni> where can you get 5TB of block device for 13 monthly euro
Feb 22 03:33:50 <bparker>	hetzner.
Feb 22 03:34:01 <bparker>	https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box/
Feb 22 03:34:03 <Soni>	that's not block device
Feb 22 03:34:12 <bparker>	how so
Feb 22 03:34:13 <phogg>	Soni: is it not?
Feb 22 03:34:15 <bparker>	I can rsync to it.
Feb 22 03:34:25 <bparker>	that's block enough for me
Feb 22 03:34:29 <Soni>	can't run dm-crypt on it
Feb 22 03:34:36 <bparker>	*rolls eyes*
Feb 22 03:34:38 <phogg>	you can also sftp, so sshfs is an option
Feb 22 03:34:57 <bparker>	you can do an rclone mount on top of it if you're really that paranoid about encrypting it
Feb 22 03:34:57 <phogg>	Soni: if you can mount it you can host an image file on it
Feb 22 03:35:30 <bparker>	inb4 still not block

Feb 22 03:41:09 <rascul>	monotheistic mythology? or something else?
Feb 22 03:41:22 <phogg>	there are no good faiths
Feb 22 03:41:30 *	phogg has now provided a hot take as requested
Feb 22 03:41:43 *	rascul turns the air conditioner on
Feb 22 03:42:25 <bparker>	what bogus claims
Feb 22 03:43:11 <bparker>	linux is great
Feb 22 03:43:21 <superkuh>	BuyVM does $15/mo for 3TB https://buyvm.net/block-storage-slabs/
Feb 22 03:43:32 *	kfrench readjusts the ayecee.
Feb 22 03:43:59 <phogg>	ananke: in this economy I'd settle for 3USD hot dogs
Feb 22 03:44:30 <rascul>	i just put chicken on the grill
Feb 22 03:44:41 <ananke>	phogg: soon you'll be lucky to get a pint of stale hot dog water for $3
Feb 22 03:44:41 <rascul>	in case anyone was wondering
Feb 22 03:45:32 <ananke>	rascul: I thought about grilling today. too damn nice for late february
Feb 22 03:45:49 <phogg>	rascul: you're going to make me want to get more food, and yet I am already in my pajamas
Feb 22 03:45:53 <rascul>	it's been cold here in mississippi today is nicest day in at least a week
Feb 22 03:46:20 <rascul>	75 and sunny
Feb 22 03:46:44 <Khaytsus>	65F here today, was nice
Feb 22 03:46:50 <rascul>	65F is cold
Feb 22 03:46:59 <bparker>	F
Feb 22 03:47:04 <Khaytsus>	65F is nice compared to <65 :P
Feb 22 03:47:10 <rascul>	well, yes
Feb 22 03:47:18 <rascul>	<65 is literally freezing
Feb 22 03:47:18 <ananke>	all of my trees are budding. that's not going to end well
Feb 22 03:47:38 <Khaytsus>	I have lilies coming up, I'll have to be covering them for the next month randomly
Feb 22 03:47:53 <phogg>	figuratively freezing
Feb 22 03:48:19 <ananke>	Khaytsus: my daffodils are coming up too
Feb 22 03:49:07 <Armand>	There's some crocus growing outside the office.. they come up every year and look great :)
Feb 22 03:50:04 <ananke>	the scary part is that this is the first year I can remember in at least couple of decades, where the grass hasn't completely turned brown to hibernate. it's still green. without some major deep freeze for an extended period of time, we'll be swarming with insects this year
Feb 22 03:50:34 <Khaytsus>	I have magic lilies everywhere around the house..  Some years they produce tons of greenery and no lilies.. other years I have lilies all over
Feb 22 03:50:46 <rascul>	literally figuratively freezing
Feb 22 03:50:48 <Khaytsus>	they spread and I eventually dig up some bulbs and replant them
Feb 22 03:51:11 <rascul>	i'm probably going to have to cut grass in a week or two
Feb 22 03:51:38 <rascul>	only took this long because winter has been extra cold
Feb 22 03:51:47 <Khaytsus>	I'm glad I have a battery mower now, no more first-mow dread of will it start and how much fuss to get it to start
Feb 22 03:51:52 <hackinghorn>	hi, I have: name="John"; greeting="Hi! I am " "$name" "ny" . Is that ideal?
Feb 22 03:52:12 <rascul>	i have too much grass to cut to spend on an expensive battery mower that won't cut it all right now
Feb 22 03:52:24 <phogg>	hackinghorn: ideal for what? Is this shell code?
Feb 22 03:52:52 <rascul>	looks acceptable for shell code but not ideal
Feb 22 03:52:59 <phogg>	it is not correct if it is shell code
Feb 22 03:53:06 <ananke>	completely unrelated: how are virtual ttys managed for serial consoles these days? specifically, I'm trying to figure out how to duplicate 'drop me directly into a root shell on serial console' that kali AWS images have
Feb 22 03:53:20 <rascul>	it's correct but won't assign $greeting as expected
Feb 22 03:53:24 <hackinghorn>	uh oh sorry thats wrong
Feb 22 03:53:37 <hackinghorn>	I want to write "Hi I am Johnny" from just John
Feb 22 03:54:02 <phogg>	it looks like you mwan to say: greetings="H! I am ${name}ny"
Feb 22 03:54:14 <rascul>	i doubt John is a command
Feb 22 03:54:17 <Khaytsus>	rascul: I have a small yard, so it's perfect for me..  Push mow, 22" deck or whatever it is, I can mow in 25 minutes
Feb 22 03:54:21 <hackinghorn>	oh yeahh, thanks phogg !
Feb 22 03:54:35 <rascul>	Khaytsus push mow takes too long here :( battery push mowers are fine though
Feb 22 03:54:48 <phogg>	hackinghorn: what you wrote was to set an env var greetings for a command equal to the value in the $name variable, then to run that command with the argument 'ny'
Feb 22 03:55:02 <Khaytsus>	rascul: Well, when I say push I don't mean a manual mower..  I mean "I pusht the mower"
Feb 22 03:55:08 <hackinghorn>	my bash skill is not sharp lately
Feb 22 03:55:43 <phogg>	hackinghorn: practice makes perfect. Thank you, come again.
Feb 22 03:56:10 <hackinghorn>	I forgot ${VAR} is a thing, I keep using $VAR
Feb 22 03:56:37 <phogg>	hackinghorn: they are the same, except if you want to make the end of the variable unambiguous
Feb 22 03:56:50 <Khaytsus>	rascul: Neighbor down the street does have a newer manual push mower..  it cuts through grass like butter but yeah no
Feb 22 03:57:14 <phogg>	hackinghorn: you could also have said: greetings="Hi! I am $name"ny with the same result
Feb 22 03:58:03 <phogg>	hackinghorn: remember, in shell to concatenate you just run strings together without any spaces. So, "$name"ny is the content of the name variable with ny tacked on the end.
Feb 22 03:58:07 <rascul>	Khaytsus "push mower" for me refers to anything from a manual reel mower to a self propelled mower with a power source attached to it
Feb 22 03:58:31 <rascul>	where power source is not equal to human
Feb 22 03:58:35 <hodapp>	hmmm I should sharpen my push-reel mower
Feb 22 03:58:42 <phogg>	rascul: I am waiting for the Tesla mower that can drive itself so I can just tell it to mow and go to work.
Feb 22 03:58:55 <Khaytsus>	rascul: I mean push mower as in the battery power I push..  vs a riding mower.   the reel I'd call a manual push mower or such I guess, I dunno.
Feb 22 03:58:58 <rascul>	phogg lots of brands have that already and it'll suck just as much as tesla's
Feb 22 03:59:01 <espresso>	rascul: two batteries do it here. so nice and quiet too
Feb 22 03:59:21 <phogg>	rascul: I've looked. They have the smarts of a roomba. I want something more like what my car can do in terms of knowing what is around it.
Feb 22 03:59:30 <tusko>	imagine mowing your own grass
Feb 22 03:59:38 <phogg>	tusko: ugh, no thanks
Feb 22 03:59:41 <rascul>	i've seen some battery zero turn riding mowers and they're still way too expensive compared to gasoline currently
Feb 22 04:00:12 <Armand>	tusko: I would much rather mow it myself.
Feb 22 04:00:16 <preach>	they're all crazy expensive now
Feb 22 04:00:30 <rascul>	phogg basically they all require a not huge yard and no debris and little elevation change
Feb 22 04:00:35 <mdogg>	ananke: My very favorite flower --> [2024-02-21 18:48:19] <ananke> Khaytsus: my daffodils are coming up too
Feb 22 04:00:37 <preach>	tusko: can we not start again with the 4chan flamebait
Feb 22 04:00:44 <phogg>	rascul: yep, and I strike out on all counts.
Feb 22 04:00:46 <rascul>	the tiny blades can't handle much
Feb 22 04:00:54 <Khaytsus>	preach: Where did that come from exactly?
Feb 22 04:01:13 <phogg>	rascul: if my yard was small I'd be less inclined to auto-mow it. Two acres is a lot for anyone.
Feb 22 04:01:23 <phogg>	and elevation changes, big check
Feb 22 04:01:42 <rascul>	phogg if you care to bother, flip one over and take a look at the blades some time, they're quite tiny compared to real mowers
Feb 22 04:01:49 <ananke>	mdogg: it's one of the few flowers that deer do not eat. I need to plant more of them
Feb 22 04:01:54 <rascul>	they can handle grass if it's not too long but that's about it
Feb 22 04:01:59 <mdogg>	Nobody mentioned 4chan.
Feb 22 04:02:15 <mdogg>	ananke: You have deer around your property?
Feb 22 04:02:16 <phogg>	rascul: glorified roomba, like I said
Feb 22 04:02:26 <phogg>	mdogg: because of rules 1 and 2
Feb 22 04:03:02 <ananke>	mdogg: yes. constantly. they get very close to the house too. they eat almost everything
Feb 22 04:03:39 <bparker>	same here. deer in the front yard right now
Feb 22 04:03:57 <bparker>	always setting off cameras
Feb 22 04:06:35 <thad_the_man>	Is there a way to get mv and cp to use a bigger blocksize?
Feb 22 04:06:47 <espresso>	in my own yard, I plant milkweed and let grass grow, but spoke of a friend's. No penguins here, however I'd be fine in Lapland
Feb 22 04:07:41 <espresso>	thad_the_man: they use the underlying fs block size
Feb 22 04:07:41 <rbox>	thad_the_man: if you want to control the block size you should use dd
Feb 22 04:07:49 <Disconsented>	mv is just rename unless its across devices
Feb 22 04:08:28 <mdogg>	ananke: The herb rosemary doesn't require a lot of water and it's extremely hardy.  I'm not sure whether you have a bunch planted already but it's also great because deer will not go anywhere near it.
Feb 22 04:08:31 <thad_the_man>	rbox: Yeah I generally use dd, but when moving directories recursively ..
Feb 22 04:08:47 <Disconsented>	looks like cp is fixed block size
Feb 22 04:08:48 <hodapp>	thad_the_man: if you're having slowness from moving directories, it's not due to block size
Feb 22 04:08:56 <Disconsented>	Might wanna use rsync/rclone instead
Feb 22 04:10:55 <thad_the_man>	hodapp, I've literally timed mv vs dd with a large blocksize and it is literally 1000 times faster.
Feb 22 04:11:01 <ananke>	mdogg: I had a huge rosemary bush that one year just didn't make it. trying to grow a new one, it's very slow for some reason (southern facing). Deer absolutely demolish any young trees/bushes. I've seen them rip out metal posts with chicken wire I've had around some younger thujas
Feb 22 04:11:40 <mdogg>	Oh yeah, they are relentless when when looking for any food source.
Feb 22 04:11:54 <ananke>	'1000 times faster' would be an outstanding performance increase. sounds dubious
Feb 22 04:12:59 <Affliction>	Did you purge the fs cache between tests? that'd explain that.
Feb 22 04:13:30 <thad_the_man>	Try it yourself on a file of say 1G with a blocksize of 100M and see.
Feb 22 04:14:07 <thad_the_man>	Affliction, yeah I did.
Feb 22 04:14:38 <mdogg>	In which area do you reside, ananke?  Is a fairly rural area where the homes are on acreage?
Feb 22 04:14:44 <mdogg>	..if you don't mind my asking..
Feb 22 04:15:17 <ananke>	'1000' times would be around the realms of impossibility, unless your initial test is dog slow. what are the _actual_ speeds?
Feb 22 04:15:58 <hodapp>	also not sure why you're comparing dd with moving a large directory tree
Feb 22 04:16:11 <Affliction>	Yeah, 10MB/s -> 10GB/s would be plausible if reading from an ancient USB disk the first time, and the cache the second time.
Feb 22 04:16:42 <Affliction>	Without synchronus writes, so the kernel finishes the write in the background
Feb 22 04:17:07 <ananke>	mdogg: business in the front, party in the back. suburb, 1 acre, backing into water conservation area/farms. best of both worlds: close to civilization up front, but with all the nature in the back
Feb 22 04:17:48 <hodapp>	moving a large directory free is going to involve a large number of filesystem operations. the block size in the dd operation is about as inconsequential as the fact that 'dd' has two more d's in the name than does 'mv'.
Feb 22 04:18:11 <mdogg>	ananke: That sounds freaking awesome.
Feb 22 04:18:43 <rbox>	hodapp: you like double d's?
Feb 22 04:18:52 <bparker>	TMI
Feb 22 04:24:40 <Affliction>	attempting repro using 10gb file; bs=100M as suggested
Feb 22 04:25:22 <mdogg>	You can always turn the tables on those deer between around August to November by going out looking for them for a change.
Feb 22 04:25:30 <mdogg>	Venison jerky tastes great and will last for a couple years if it's stored properly.
Feb 22 04:25:32 <Disconsented>	Moving a large directory to the same fs should be a trivial change, you're just updating links
Feb 22 04:26:38 <Affliction>	yeah, mv completes that instantly
Feb 22 04:26:44 <Affliction>	cp too, if your fs supports reflinks
Feb 22 04:27:38 <Affliction>	Yeah, with a echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches in the middle; same speed between mv and dd with bs=100M
Feb 22 04:28:13 <Affliction>	in fact, mv was about a second faster, believe it or not!
Feb 22 04:28:37 <thad_the_man>	blocksize on mv is ridiculosly small, like 2k. dd a 1G file with a blockize of 100M is 10 reads, with mv it is like 500,000 reads.
Feb 22 04:28:50 <mdogg>	Well, you just need to run 'mv' again but this time make it less nice.
Feb 22 04:29:01 <mdogg>	Er, more nice*
Feb 22 04:29:12 <Disconsented>	thad_the_man> What's the story here?
Feb 22 04:30:12 <mdogg>	The block size for a file in a Linux file system is determined by the file system's block size.
Feb 22 04:30:56 <mdogg>	The file move operation doesn't impact it.
Feb 22 04:31:36 <Affliction>	And the kernel is free to fuse operations to the disk as it desires.
Feb 22 04:32:19 <mdogg>	Yeah - when a file is created, it's allocated space in multiples of the file system's block size.  This block size is set during file system creation and can't be changed without reformatting the file system.
Feb 22 04:32:54 <Affliction>	Even if you dd with bs=512, if you look at the underlying block operations, the kernel incrementally uses larger blocks, speculating that more will be read.
Feb 22 04:33:00 <mdogg>	I should have said 'it is' rather than that first "it's" - it doesn't read right to me.
Feb 22 04:33:15 <Affliction>	Of course, with bs=1G, fragmentation will pretty much guarantee that needs to be split into smaller iops
Feb 22 04:33:39 <Affliction>	Sure, syscall overhead per read/write call in that case
Feb 22 04:33:42 <Affliction>	er, the former case
Feb 22 04:34:05 <mdogg>	Affliction: A very good point about fragmentation and nicely stated.
Feb 22 04:35:51 <rascul>	just don't fragment my beer
Feb 22 04:38:30 *	ssm_ fragments rascul's raskull
Feb 22 04:38:44 <Affliction>	But yeah, if we really are talking orders of magnitude like 1000x, something else is going on.
Feb 22 04:39:44 <mdogg>	There's an option that I found in XFCE (someplace) that I thought was super cool.  It's something like "Pre-allocate disk space when copying, moving, or extracting large files"  I don't remember the wording exactly but that really is a great idea.
Feb 22 04:40:27 <mdogg>	So for example if foo.tar is 10gb (ten 1gb files) and you extract it to ~/Videos, it will first create ten 1gb files to reserve that area of the disk, thus minimizing fragmentation.  It would be cool if that was an option available to all desktop environments but I have only seen it in XFCE.
Feb 22 04:41:18 <mdogg>	Or you know what?  I think it actually creates one 10gb file and then uses that area for the ten 1gb files as they are extracted.  I can't remember now..
Feb 22 04:41:39 <mdogg>	Something cool.
Feb 22 04:41:56 <Affliction>	hm, is that last method doable? Seems like giving blocks from one file to another would be fs dependant
Feb 22 04:42:20 <Affliction>	but then falloc does allow doing interesting things to the blocks that make up files.
Feb 22 04:43:07 <mdogg>	I think you're right.  As the 10gb space is freed for the individual files, it would also be freed for other files which are being moved around the disk, thus undoing what it's supposed to do.
Feb 22 04:44:09 <mdogg>	I'm getting pretty hungry so I'm gonna get out of here and do something about that.
Feb 22 04:44:12 <mdogg>	Have a good night.
Feb 22 04:44:24 <Affliction>	Kinda visualizing it as being like mmap, but in the filesystem.
Feb 22 04:44:35 <Affliction>	er, for blocks within the filesystem, instead of pages of memory
Feb 22 04:46:19 <Affliction>	But yeah, wouldn't surprise me if the underlying behavior of mv and cp use sendfile() when data has to actually be copied.
Feb 22 04:46:26 <Affliction>	In which case, 1 syscall, kernel does the rest.
Feb 22 04:47:19 <thad_the_man>	IT might mv and cp are kind of old and not touched much. The cose may predate sendfile.
Feb 22 04:47:20 <mdogg>	If I remember right, bittorrent applications have a similar methodology to reserve space first when a torrent is downloaded because the data within a torrent comes in pieces from all over the place at different times.
Feb 22 04:47:49 <thad_the_man>	s/cose/code/
Feb 22 04:47:53 <mdogg>	I use mv and cp all the time.
Feb 22 04:48:12 <mdogg>	Anyway, nice talking to you guys.  cheers!
Feb 22 04:48:32 <espresso>	cheers, mdogg
Feb 22 04:48:55 <mdogg>	How do you rename something without mv?
Feb 22 04:49:34 <bajablastoise>	mv [original name] [new name]
Feb 22 04:49:40 <bajablastoise>	lol
Feb 22 04:49:44 <bajablastoise>	I'm stupid
Feb 22 04:50:09 <espresso>	maybe create a hard link with 'ln' and delete the old link? heh
Feb 22 04:56:49 <bparker>	mdogg: rename
Feb 22 04:57:45 <bparker>	or write a C program and call rename() yourself
Feb 22 04:57:54 <bparker>	or any other language that can call it
Feb 22 04:59:10 <hackinghorn>	check out https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck . I can't believe it has  81k stars
Feb 22 04:59:40 <Khaytsus>	Was that really necessary to link
Feb 22 04:59:57 <bparker>	sigh
Feb 22 05:00:21 <hackinghorn>	oh its famous?
Feb 22 05:00:53 <Armand>	I'm not clicking that.
Feb 22 05:00:53 <bparker>	no it just has 81k stars /s
Feb 22 05:01:32 <bparker>	hackinghorn: they're just upset because it has a swear word in it and that's against the rules except when it's not
Feb 22 05:01:34 <hackinghorn>	does anyone need to rename?
Feb 22 05:01:37 <Affliction>	mdogg │ How do you rename something without mv? <- Take a hex editor to /dev/whatever, obviously!
Feb 22 05:01:40 <r-zan>	Now I'm torn between "Take the warning sign from everyone else" and morbid curiosity
Feb 22 05:01:51 <r-zan>	Oh, I was expecting some horrible troll lol
Feb 22 05:02:31 <Affliction>	I think I've installed it at least 3 times, used it a few times, then forgotten about it, heh
Feb 22 05:02:42 <bparker>	need to app to remind you that you forgot
Feb 22 05:02:45 <bparker>	an app*
Feb 22 05:02:56 <bparker>	call it prevagen
Feb 22 05:11:50 <Random6>	Anyone here play fallout 3 lately?
Feb 22 05:12:45 <Disconsented>	Thats a funny way of saying new vegas
Feb 22 05:13:49 <qman>	I mean, people say that, but I've beaten fallout 3 several times over, but I never even made it to vegas in new vegas
Feb 22 05:14:10 <Disconsented>	I went back to new vegas recently, its still great
Feb 22 05:14:36 <qman>	I got sick of the bugs and crashes and just stopped
Feb 22 05:14:51 <Disconsented>	Okay yeah the bugs are a problem
Feb 22 05:14:59 <Disconsented>	Crashes have been largely fixed recently
Feb 22 05:15:25 <Disconsented>	TL;DR essentially just running out of RAM because its a 32bit process and they do weird things with caching
Feb 22 05:15:26 <qman>	which is not to say fallout 3 didn't have issues either, but they were manageable
Feb 22 05:15:41 <qman>	new vegas was an order of magnitude worse on that front
Feb 22 05:17:05 <bparker>	are you playing on linux
Feb 22 05:20:06 <espresso>	New Vegas, I had little or no trouble after a few patches, and thought it one of the best
Feb 22 05:23:32 <espresso>	(tent mod!) think I'll try it in linux with the new rig
Feb 22 05:23:43 <Disconsented>	I played heavily modded and it was pretty much crash free
Feb 22 05:24:01 <Disconsented>	https://next.nexusmods.com/newvegas/collections/jscbqj
Feb 22 05:28:27 <alih>	i also managed to play new vegas through WINE with some patches (anti crash, tick fix) and it pretty much ran flawlessly
Feb 22 05:35:57 <spine-o-saurus>	anyone else get that bug where the pipewire audio from speakers stops when lldb is running a program and that program crashes in lldb?

Feb 22 06:08:25 <Random6>	bparker: I am not playing it on Linux, no. I wonder if Vortex mods would be compatible with Linux and steam
Feb 22 06:08:39 <Random6>	I just put in 4 hours into Fallout 3.
Feb 22 06:08:50 <Random6>	Still a great game.
Feb 22 06:09:30 <Random6>	alih: Did you have any latency issues playing in wine?
Feb 22 06:10:22 <Random6>	I am playing it on an Intel Iris XE integrated gpu. It runs about 45 fps maxed outdoors.

Feb 22 06:14:47 <korn3r>	does anyone know if redhat provides ftp repos for latest os releases?
Feb 22 06:15:31 <Disconsented>	Best to use SFTP where possible
Feb 22 06:15:48 <nullvalue>	without paying. no korn3r
Feb 22 06:15:58 <nullvalue>	no idea how to get there
Feb 22 06:17:04 <korn3r>	well...if somehow one can find out plain ftp repo...
Feb 22 06:17:09 <Armand>	Nope.
Feb 22 06:17:18 <nullvalue>	and libera does not support piracy so cant help you that way either, sowwy
Feb 22 06:17:49 <Disconsented>	plain FTP
Feb 22 06:17:51 <Disconsented>	What, why korn3r?
Feb 22 06:18:03 <nullvalue>	try look in some forums, some times you find stuffs there....
Feb 22 06:18:14 <Bahhumbug>	Red Hat certainly does (although not ftp.... it's 2024... stop using ftp) as long as you pay them.
Feb 22 06:18:30 <ayecee>	it's 2024. you don't have to pay them. they have free licenses for personal use.
Feb 22 06:18:55 <korn3r>	i can have it as personal developer. what would be the difference without having to bother with subscription. I created acountt today and site bugged couple times, yet i have repos for free, but with sub. not like im paying for it, yet it says free
Feb 22 06:19:00 <nullvalue>	wel, you have to register for it
Feb 22 06:20:06 <nullvalue>	or you could find developer/tester versions, do they do that?? im guessing they might
Feb 22 06:20:06 <korn3r>	im not installing it in enterprise, and that registration and sub-manager thing technically only to count +1 personal developer.
Feb 22 06:20:43 <nullvalue>	whats so special about RHEL that other linux's cant....mmmmm
Feb 22 06:20:52 <korn3r>	being enterprise
Feb 22 06:21:05 <Bahhumbug>	Enterprise buy-in and support for all manner of commercial stacks that aren't available elsewhere.
Feb 22 06:21:22 <korn3r>	and no, i use for personal, but since windows i refer enterprise. and since its free (redhat)... i want that
Feb 22 06:21:23 <nullvalue>	if i were a chick i would be rolling my eyes right now, but ugghhh
Feb 22 06:22:35 <nullvalue>	hmmm, makes sense
Feb 22 06:22:56 <nullvalue>	enterprise level support and goodies, ok
Feb 22 06:23:48 <ayecee>	and a pony
Feb 22 06:24:28 <nullvalue>	oooh a pony
Feb 22 06:24:33 <nullvalue>	niice

Feb 22 06:25:53 <Random6>	Anyone know if I can mirror my pc games onto an android tablet screen via usb cable?
Feb 22 06:26:03 <Random6>	I have already mirrored my android onto pc
Feb 22 06:26:05 <ayecee>	nope :(
Feb 22 06:26:09 <Random6>	dang
Feb 22 06:26:21 <Random6>	That would be ideal.
Feb 22 06:26:32 <ayecee>	right? second life for a lot of old tablets.
Feb 22 06:26:36 <nullvalue>	mirror'in is crapple area of expertise , no
Feb 22 06:26:44 <Armand>	No.
Feb 22 06:26:45 <Random6>	Yes exactly ayecee
Feb 22 06:26:57 <Armand>	It's just not worth the investment of developer time.
Feb 22 06:27:11 <Random6>	I'm surprised no one has done it yet.
Feb 22 06:27:15 <Armand>	I'm not.
Feb 22 06:27:17 <Random6>	*maybe they have
Feb 22 06:27:36 <nullvalue>	Random6: perhaps remote something something android
Feb 22 06:27:40 <ayecee>	i don't think the hardware support is there.
Feb 22 06:28:00 <Random6>	yeah maybe there's some way to do it.
Feb 22 06:28:05 <ayecee>	you can do remote something something but the latency is gonna be long.
Feb 22 06:28:10 <nullvalue>	it would help if you defined usecase for this
Feb 22 06:28:11 <Random6>	yeah true
Feb 22 06:28:19 <ayecee>	nullvalue: already did.
Feb 22 06:28:27 <nullvalue>	oh games
Feb 22 06:28:34 <nullvalue>	sorry i missed tht part
Feb 22 06:28:41 <Random6>	Didn't PS4 allow the Sony handhelds to remotely screencast?
Feb 22 06:28:51 <Random6>	from ps4 to handheld?
Feb 22 06:28:53 <nullvalue>	there are cable that do exactly that

Feb 22 06:32:21 <ayecee>	they don't
Feb 22 06:32:30 <Armand>	The tablet would need a HDMI *input*

Feb 22 06:42:54 <ayecee>	yes
Feb 22 07:12:07 <dumbfrog>	i am new to linux. im using mint and im very happy with it. i was wondering, are there antivirus or security programs that are good? are they necessary?
Feb 22 07:12:29 <tusko>	the lord is testing me
Feb 22 07:13:04 <r-zan>	To be honest, not really unless you have some incredibly unsafe browsing habits
Feb 22 07:13:11 <Disconsented>	There isnt a significant need for that dumbfrog, you'll generally acquire software via a package manager so its a lot harder to get bad software
Feb 22 07:13:23 <Disconsented>	Just make sure you run an adblock (read: ublock origin) and you're probably fine
Feb 22 07:13:38 <r-zan>	I like to use portmaster personally, though. Just because I think it's a good tool for looking at network data
Feb 22 07:13:59 <dumbfrog>	if the test is to be kind to new stupid people, then pass the testy and be nice to dumb people that ask non expert questions :)
Feb 22 07:14:28 <Disconsented>	I'd ignore that comment from tusko
Feb 22 07:14:29 <dumbfrog>	Disconsented: thank you
Feb 22 07:15:10 <dumbfrog>	it doesnt bother me. FNG new guys usually get crap heh heh
Feb 22 07:15:22 <r-zan>	Oh right, I'm sorry
Feb 22 07:15:25 <r-zan>	*Clears his throat*
Feb 22 07:15:34 <r-zan>	RTFM, use a man page, uuuh...
Feb 22 07:15:43 <r-zan>	I cant do it
Feb 22 07:16:37 <r-zan>	To be honest though, I feel like even on windows you barely need an antivirus unless you visit a lot of shady pirate sites or something
Feb 22 07:16:44 <r-zan>	Defender does a good enough job
Feb 22 07:18:35 <nullvalue>	tusko: stay strong
Feb 22 07:20:48 <Norkle>	:]
Feb 22 07:21:25 <spine-o-saurus>	there is something weird goin on with these search engines, i type in opencode net and ~12 entries show up
Feb 22 07:24:41 <superkuh>	Google search only returns a maximum of about 400 search results for any given search. No matter how many results it says there are. If you press > enough (2 or 3 times for 100 per page) then it runs out.
Feb 22 07:24:48 <superkuh>	I believe bing maxes out at 900?
Feb 22 07:25:12 <superkuh>	Modern search engines are severely limited and do not allow for deep search.
Feb 22 07:25:25 <superkuh>	12... might be some other problem though.
Feb 22 07:27:21 <r-zan>	On this topic sort of, if it's not just me...what is going on with searches lately? Be it DDG, Startpage, Google or Bing.
Feb 22 07:27:26 <dumbfrog>	i tried to run sudo apt install portmaster. on mint 21.2. it said reading package lists done, building dependancy tree done, reading state information done. E: unable to locate package portmaster
Feb 22 07:27:31 <r-zan>	I cant put my finger on it, but I feel like it's harder to find stuff
Feb 22 07:28:18 <r-zan>	Aaaah, some programs you have to get a .deb file for.
Feb 22 07:28:54 <r-zan>	Not everything is in the normal mint repos, so some stuff you do gotta search around for
Feb 22 07:30:46 <spine-o-saurus>	then you end up building packages which means you need a source based distro
Feb 22 07:31:14 <r-zan>	Eh? I'm on mint and I use it just fine
Feb 22 07:31:32 <dumbfrog>	mint said unable to locate package portmaster. i dont think i damaged anything
Feb 22 07:32:21 <r-zan>	Oh, that's because portmaster isn't in the default mint repositories
Feb 22 07:32:47 <dumbfrog>	im new to linux, just learning.
Feb 22 07:32:49 <r-zan>	safing.io has a .deb file that lets you install it.
Feb 22 07:33:57 <r-zan>	So, you know how apt lets you install stuff via command line?
Feb 22 07:34:16 <dumbfrog>	yes
Feb 22 07:34:17 <r-zan>	It does that by going through the URLs in your software sources. They're pretty expansive, but not infinite
Feb 22 07:34:47 <r-zan>	So you also have other ways of installing software, like using .deb files for debian based distros
Feb 22 07:35:06 <r-zan>	Flatpaks are another source of software, as well as appimage which is a portable executable
Feb 22 07:36:28 <r-zan>	There's also snap packages, but no one really suggests those unless they are skinwalkers
Feb 22 07:39:39 <spine-o-saurus>	WTF does this mean? Assimp 5.2 importer error: BLEND: BLENDER magic bytes are missing, couldn't find GZIP header either
Feb 22 07:40:05 <spine-o-saurus>	i checked and assimp is installed
Feb 22 07:40:06 <dumbfrog>	r-zan: thats prob way beyond my skill level at this time.
Feb 22 07:40:31 <r-zan>	That's all good. Did you just very recently install Mint, frog?
Feb 22 07:40:51 <r-zan>	Also, I hate weird cryptic BS errors like that. I wish I knew more
Feb 22 07:41:00 <dumbfrog>	i bought a laptop from think penguin with mint installed.
Feb 22 07:42:13 <dumbfrog>	a while back i somehow did damage to a microsoft windows computer trying to split the hard drive. it didnt work. for dumb people its better just to buy a computer with a linux distro installed
Feb 22 07:42:30 <r-zan>	Oh ho, well... welcome to the cult.
Feb 22 07:42:45 <r-zan>	We make weekly sacrifices to the church of Stallman, don't bring potato salad please.
Feb 22 07:42:48 <dumbfrog>	thank you :)
Feb 22 07:43:12 <r-zan>	But, I say tinker around, have fun with it
Feb 22 07:43:22 <r-zan>	Get a thumb drive, put ventoy and a bunch of other isos on it
Feb 22 07:43:34 <r-zan>	Treat your laptop like a toy, and if you bork your system... just reinstall
Feb 22 07:43:56 <r-zan>	That's what I did for my first year
Feb 22 07:44:57 <dumbfrog>	think penguin will give you a 3% discount if you listen to 1 episode of theyre freedom decryted radio show, and another 2% discount if you interact with a bot using encrypted email
Feb 22 07:45:17 <dumbfrog>	kinda cool people
Feb 22 07:47:38 <tusko>	https://imgur.com/a/lTz4MMp
Feb 22 07:47:57 <dumbfrog>	think penguin will admit that encryption is breakable. but the more people that use it the better off society is. it makes if though for big brother to pry into peoples stuff
Feb 22 07:48:23 <nullvalue>	lol'd @ don't bring potato salad please.
Feb 22 07:49:29 <r-zan>	Personally, I think laptops should be encrypted. Just because they're such easy swipes for thieves
Feb 22 07:50:12 <silly>	bring cake instead https://www.facebook.com/UdrugaSok/photos/pb.100064365352418.-2207520000/1085504318132580/?type=3
Feb 22 07:50:15 <r-zan>	Though, I have had issues with steam and ancrypted drives
Feb 22 07:50:32 <r-zan>	I cant load either image :(
Feb 22 07:50:43 <dumbfrog>	r-zan, i agree. people new to linux will obviously make mistakes. ive used timeshift on mint twice to undo stuff. the first time i was kinda scared i damaged my new laptop
Feb 22 07:51:12 <Patrick_>	why isn't ls aliased to ls -i by default?
Feb 22 07:51:24 <r-zan>	Haha, unless you physically harm your laptop tbh
Feb 22 07:51:31 <r-zan>	I dont think you have to worry about any kind of damage
Feb 22 07:51:50 <Patrick_>	what's wrong with potato salad?
Feb 22 07:52:00 <Patrick_>	sounds great actually
Feb 22 07:52:10 <Patrick_>	but I haven't had it in maybe over 20 years
Feb 22 07:52:24 <dumbfrog>	its that good?
Feb 22 07:52:27 <mlu>	Patrick_: is this the krusty krab?
Feb 22 07:52:27 <silly>	yeah... i want cake and coffee
Feb 22 07:52:28 <Patrick_>	I liked it
Feb 22 07:52:29 <Norkle>	potato bake!
Feb 22 07:52:36 <r-zan>	I love potato salad, but I'm picky about other people's potato salad
Feb 22 07:52:40 <Patrick_>	cake and coffee is the best of things
Feb 22 07:52:46 <mlu>	coffecake

Feb 22 07:59:28 <dumbfrog>	"bulletproof" coffee is one of the best breakfasts. its coffee with 1.5 Tbsp of butter and 1.5 Tbsp coconut oil blended into. i use a cuisinart stick blender. you actually have to blend it for like 30 seconds, but the best thing is to rinse off the stick blender just run it under the faucet and its spotless clean

Feb 22 08:00:52 <dumbfrog>	bulletproof coffee is really good. and healthy. i love sugar but i hate the low 4 hours later and being hungry again
Feb 22 08:01:04 <silly>	tilgo text
Feb 22 08:01:13 <Karyonix>	How minix is differ from linux ?
Feb 22 08:01:30 <louipc>	oh yea i put butter in it
Feb 22 08:01:35 <louipc>	no coconut
Feb 22 08:01:52 <louipc>	oh shoot this is linux
Feb 22 08:01:52 <silly>	dumbfrog, i often eat coffee instead of drinking food too
Feb 22 08:02:29 <louipc>	you can breathe sunshine and drink air
Feb 22 08:03:14 <dumbfrog>	use grass fed butter and coconut oil (for its medium chain triglycerides) very healthy. you wont be hungry all day, then eat a healthy dinner.
Feb 22 08:04:36 <r-zan>	I have forsaken coffee. I get my caffiene from dollar store jet-alert caffiene tabs
Feb 22 08:04:57 <silly>	til that bulletproof coffee is a thing
Feb 22 08:04:58 <r-zan>	Which I just grind up and mix into my redbull that I use to mix some preworkout
Feb 22 08:05:04 <louipc>	who feeds gras too butter
Feb 22 08:05:12 <dumbfrog>	i read some books, ketoclarity was prob the best. it helped me get my weight under control. totally off topic but good advice for anyone like me that needs to manage weight heh heh
Feb 22 08:05:38 <silly>	dumbfrog, did you have to go up or down?
Feb 22 08:05:45 <dumbfrog>	lmao :)
Feb 22 08:06:00 <dumbfrog>	down. by 40 lbs heh heh
Feb 22 08:06:45 <dumbfrog>	but it works. they say you cant argue with results. (obviously the results have to be good to say that)
Feb 22 08:10:03 <nullvalue>	dumbfrog is infecting #linux with the dumb, oh noes
Feb 22 08:10:07 *	nullvalue runs and hides
Feb 22 08:10:14 <dumbfrog>	to be honest i know a lot more about metabolism, fitness, diet, nutrition than linux. mentioning "bulletproof" coffee is my way o trying to pay back the stuff i learn here
Feb 22 08:10:22 <r-zan>	Not quite a linux thing, but out of curiosity...who else here uses element? I've been trying to find like, a good use-case for it
Feb 22 08:10:32 <r-zan>	But it seems like such a ghost town full of mostly bots
Feb 22 08:11:59 <r-zan>	Err, not element. But Matrix, rather.
Feb 22 08:12:51 <nullvalue>	never used it tbh
Feb 22 08:13:18 <Karyonix>	dumbfrog, what kind a coffee you like ?
Feb 22 08:13:41 <r-zan>	I started trying it out because I'm tired of hating discord and using it. So I decided to just nuke discord and force myself to look for alternatives
Feb 22 08:14:00 <nullvalue>	define "nuke discord" !!!

Feb 22 08:14:34 <r-zan>	LET THE ASHES OF DISCORD HQ BLOW ACROSS THE WINDS. FOREVER LOST TO TIME
Feb 22 08:14:35 <dumbfrog>	with butter and coconut oil blended in. a lot of it blended in
Feb 22 08:14:42 <r-zan>	But no, I just deleted my account lol
Feb 22 08:15:04 <nullvalue>	hmm, boring i thought you haxxored them hue hu hue
Feb 22 08:15:15 <r-zan>	lmao
Feb 22 08:15:30 <nullvalue>	on that note haxxoring stuff is hugely frowned upon according to libera guidelines
Feb 22 08:15:38 <r-zan>	If discord gets hacked I'll crap my pants
Feb 22 08:16:00 <r-zan>	Then all my saucy furry rp logs will get leaked and mom will find out I'm not really working from home
Feb 22 08:16:04 <nullvalue>	aint no one got time for that r-zan
Feb 22 08:16:23 <r-zan>	I'm kidding, obviously
Feb 22 08:17:00 <dumbfrog>	medium roast has more caffeine than the dark roasts. caffeine is actually an anti oxidant and might be good at preventing Alzheimer's
Feb 22 08:17:05 <nullvalue>	ok moving on
Feb 22 08:17:07 <r-zan>	But, I just dont like it because discord is just bloat spyware.
Feb 22 08:17:24 <r-zan>	A chat program should not consume more ram than my entire desktop environment
Feb 22 08:17:26 <Disconsented>	Ah yes unfounded buzzwords
Feb 22 08:17:43 <Disconsented>	Its a bit more than _just a chat program_
Feb 22 08:18:05 *	nullvalue grabs popcorns again
Feb 22 08:18:13 <r-zan>	Yeah, but that's the only value it has to me
Feb 22 08:19:43 <dumbfrog>	im disappointed to hear that discord is bloated spyware. but for some reason im not surprised.
Feb 22 08:21:09 <dumbfrog>	if you contain discord onto one device it might not be a problem.
Feb 22 08:22:12 <r-zan>	I just don't care for how it has to be "all encompasing"
Feb 22 08:22:19 <louipc>	then pour gasoline on the device and throw a lit match onto it
Feb 22 08:22:39 <dumbfrog>	what do you expect considering its a social media platform. free sign up, but of course theyre gonna harvest data from users.
Feb 22 08:22:50 <louipc>	just kidding
Feb 22 08:22:54 <r-zan>	The account/name I use for my shitposting, my RL friends, my gamer friends, family, that one mod that the download link is hidden in a discord server, tech support for this one program, etc
Feb 22 08:23:02 <r-zan>	All on one account, one name
Feb 22 08:23:10 <louipc>	nioce
Feb 22 08:25:14 <tusko>	louipc: what's up dude glad you're alive
Feb 22 08:26:41 <louipc>	tusko: not much how bout you? glad you're alive too. do we know each other?
Feb 22 08:27:02 <tusko>	yeah, you're the church of bitcoin guy
Feb 22 08:27:20 <louipc>	nah that's not me. i chatted with him a good deal tho
Feb 22 08:27:30 <nullvalue>	whats a church of bitcoin??
Feb 22 08:27:32 <louipc>	no idea what he's up to
Feb 22 08:27:35 <tusko>	well, you know what they say
Feb 22 08:27:47 <tusko>	lie down with dogs, become flea
Feb 22 08:27:58 <louipc>	heh ok
Feb 22 08:28:04 <dumbfrog>	r-zan, you have more computer knowledge than me by far, but i kinda question the wisdom of an all in one account. i dont think that would work for me. im kinda stupid and have been kicked off of many platforms many times
Feb 22 08:28:21 <nullvalue>	lay with dogs, _______________!!! fill in the blanks
Feb 22 08:28:43 <tusko>	that's a paddlin for sure
Feb 22 08:29:34 <tusko>	dumbfrog: if you just use GNU pass you get extra protections by and from stallman
Feb 22 08:30:46 <Patrick_>	dumbfrog: I don't think this is so much a matter of computer knowedge. Which reminds me about the common attitude about "experts". When publishers have expert guests to tell them something obvious is so strange.
Feb 22 08:30:50 <dumbfrog>	pre elon musk twitter was classic. you could easily test their algorithm things with political statements from both sides. say something good about biden and you would get lots of interaction. say something good about trump and you got pigeon holed in a vacuum
Feb 22 08:31:12 <dumbfrog>	it was kinda crazy
Feb 22 08:31:16 <Disconsented>	No politics thanks
Feb 22 08:31:43 <Patrick_>	notice the last thing said before the request to stop politics
Feb 22 08:32:03 <Disconsented>	:)

Feb 22 08:33:54 <silly>	well then, coffee and cake it is (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
Feb 22 08:34:02 <Karyonix>	Did you know that in intel platforms under Linux play minix code ? xd
Feb 22 08:34:36 <r-zan>	I need to hang around IRC more
Feb 22 08:36:54 <dumbfrog>	Patrick_: that is a good point. sometimes dummies like me excel at stating the obvious heh heh. but understatement is a great form of humor was a statment made by someone wiser than myself
Feb 22 08:39:03 <dumbfrog>	i think IRC is kinda great. its old school. i wish there was a way to bring more people onto it
Feb 22 08:41:00 <down200>	I just set up IRC and ZNC this past week, really enjoying not waiting a solid 1-2 seconds every time I want to visit a new channel/server like with discord
Feb 22 08:42:03 <dumbfrog>	maybe its better that its not super simple like facebook. it takes a little work to get here. most people here prob work with computers professionally, but for non pros it takes a bit of effort. but its worth it in my opinion
Feb 22 08:43:05 <steering>	honestly, webchats are easier to use than signing up for discord, discord just has network effects going for it
Feb 22 08:43:36 <r-zan>	I just feel like if I'm having unencrypted public text chats, there shouldn't be so much overhead
Feb 22 08:43:39 <down200>	That's actually a big reason why I wanted to check it out, seems the normal chat-goers have long since abandoned IRC networks in favor of zoomer options like Discord/Snapchat/Instagram, leaving only technical people left
Feb 22 08:44:02 <steering>	I think half the problem is that people think of IRC as mirc or irssi instead of thelounge or irccloud
Feb 22 08:44:19 <r-zan>	like, I dont need 20 million bells and whistles when the most Im gonna do is...what I'm doing right now.
Feb 22 08:44:29 <r-zan>	Though, being able to share images and the like would be nice.
Feb 22 08:44:54 <steering>	something something if you're not paying, then you're the product... how many people actually pay discord
Feb 22 08:45:01 <down200>	steering: I don't know, I think that's a good thing. I'm just so tired of the sluggish bloated ""modern"" webUIs designed by a bunch of webdevs that don't even use the product
Feb 22 08:45:29 <down200>	Being able to have essentially full functionality from terminal clients is pretty neat
Feb 22 08:45:41 <steering>	down200: oh don't get me wrong, i'm using irssi right now. but a lot of (technical!) people complain that irc is that thing from the past that doesn't support any of the fancy embeds and gifs and whatever
Feb 22 08:46:00 <r-zan>	I'm starting to lean in that direction. Yeah, I'm using hexchat now, but the draw of going more terminal-based is hitting me
Feb 22 08:46:41 <r-zan>	The only thing stopping me is then I feel like EVERYTHING has to be a terminal application, or it wont feel consistent
Feb 22 08:46:42 <steering>	which, it's a legitimate opinion to have anyway. meanwhile my opinion of embeds in my irc client is "why, so people can spam goatse?"
Feb 22 08:47:06 <r-zan>	goatse in the year of our lord 2024
Feb 22 08:47:13 <Disconsented>	Okay lets just.. not
Feb 22 08:47:15 <steering>	r-zan: honestly, i live my life in a web browser and a terminal
Feb 22 08:48:18 <dumbfrog>	ive never used discord but it sounds like a big corp product and you pay for it by letting them data mine you. if you talk about your dog you will get dog food ads
Feb 22 08:48:35 <Disconsented>	They've got a subscription service with it
Feb 22 08:48:52 <steering>	technically they monetize it with "discord nitro" or whatever, which does have decent subscribership at least.
Feb 22 08:48:54 <down200>	dumbfrog: yeah, you're right on the mark.
Feb 22 08:49:17 <r-zan>	Yeah, I mean to be quite honest. It's popular for a reason. If you're playing games online, it's your best bet for a source of easy communication
Feb 22 08:49:35 <r-zan>	But beyond that? Yeah, pretty much.
Feb 22 08:50:46 <down200>	Yeah it definetely makes things easy, but I don't think it's really improved at all in that regard minus adding a ton of feature-creep
Feb 22 08:51:25 <r-zan>	If anything, I think it's gotten worse. Around 2019/2020 I found it tolerable. I preferred teamspeak but whatever
Feb 22 08:51:39 <dumbfrog>	down200, "zoomer" is a great term. im going to use it
Feb 22 08:51:42 <r-zan>	But within the last few years? I feel like the program has gotten worse
Feb 22 08:52:34 <down200>	dumbfrog: I didn't invent it anyway lol :P
Feb 22 08:53:49 <down200>	r-zan: I agree, I actually quite liked it back in the early 2016-2017 era back when it was a dedicated chat app "for gamers". It was performant _enough_ for what it was, though confusing for newcomers
Feb 22 08:54:41 <dumbfrog>	its self explanatory and highly accurate and an insult to an insult. what more could you ask for from a term.
Feb 22 08:54:59 <mdogg>	bparker: I've lived my entire life not realizing there was a 'rename' command in Linux.  Seriously, thanks for pointing it out to me - it's really cool!  From the man page, "rename [options] expression replacement file(s)" --> Examples:  'rename .htm .html *.htm' will change all .htm files to .html like they should be.  Or 'rename .jpg .jpeg *.jpg' will convert all files with .jpg extensions to .jpeg
Feb 22 08:59:12 <r-zan>	Either way, it happened to skype, it happened to MSN messenger, it happened to AIM
Feb 22 08:59:17 <r-zan>	It'll happen to discord too
Feb 22 08:59:19 <dumbfrog>	im new to linux and one of the first things i looked up was the 14 most dangerous linux commands. rename was on that list
Feb 22 09:00:17 <dumbfrog>	its a cool list. fork bombs and crazy stuff you might not be able to timeshift reset your way out of
Feb 22 09:01:47 <dumbfrog>	coding is cool. but i think it takes many years if not decades of experience to be good at it
Feb 22 09:02:49 <r-zan>	This is admittedly why I was suggesting earlier to take a while and treat linux as a bit of a toy that you abuse. It can be easy imo to bork your system but
Feb 22 09:03:00 <r-zan>	It's also incredibly easy to just reinstall and start fresh
Feb 22 09:03:35 <r-zan>	If you keep your home folder backed up, you can even just copy-paste it right back, reboot and be up and running again relatively quickly
Feb 22 09:04:17 <ski>	"that doesn't support any of the fancy embeds and gifs and whatever" is a good thing
Feb 22 09:05:20 <ski>	(now, what's missing is a way to strip out all emoji from messages (or maybe replace them with that `:thing:' ?))
Feb 22 09:05:29 <dumbfrog>	timeshift has saved me twice. its kinda scary when timeshift seems to get stuck and after 15 minutes you just hold down the power button. but it solves the problem. no complaints from me

Feb 22 09:38:34 <fdan36>	can i get any help?
Feb 22 09:39:49 <Scissors>	dumbfrogonMint: What's usual problems, if weak AC adapter? I have random poweroffs, smells of hot metal, and (sometimes) 1-2 minutes (almost) instantly poweroff, after trying to power on;
Feb 22 09:40:07 <Scissors>	and I don't know what cause the problems
Feb 22 09:40:28 <Norkle>	usbc is great on chromebook!
Feb 22 09:40:51 <Scissors>	at the moment of poweroffs, even if smells as fried metal, lm-sensors see relativly normal temperature
Feb 22 09:41:00 <dumbfrogonMint>	my mint laptop uses a 45 watt transformer. my MSI laptop uses a 230 watt transformer.
Feb 22 09:41:08 <uwu>	fdan36: dnf list installed glibc
Feb 22 09:41:14 <Scissors>	and sometimes, I can't poweron in a several hours
Feb 22 09:41:14 <dumbfrogonMint>	check the power cords for any signs of damage
Feb 22 09:41:27 <fdan36>	uwu -bash: dnf: command not found
Feb 22 09:41:38 <uwu>	yum list installed glibc
Feb 22 09:41:41 <Scissors>	dumbfrogonMint: there is no visual damage
Feb 22 09:42:41 *	Scissors tried to reset bios, played with grub commandline, and lowering cpu frequency; lowering of it decrease chance of poweroffs
Feb 22 09:44:12 <dumbfrogonMint>	the AC adapter itself will not fail. it most likey a connection where it plugs into the laptop or the wall. use your nose and ears
Feb 22 09:44:41 <Scissors>	but usually, even under max frequency  & load , everything works
Feb 22 09:44:46 <Scissors>	ears? how?
Feb 22 09:46:10 <spine-o-saurus>	its hard to get rid of that burn smell
Feb 22 09:46:22 <dumbfrogonMint>	i would guess its a problem inside the laptop if there is no trace of visible damage with the cords.
Feb 22 09:46:57 <dumbfrogonMint>	its gotta be the power input on the laptop. i have damaged those myself on numerous occasions
Feb 22 09:47:21 <fdan36>	uwu glibc.x86_64                                           2.26-63.amzn2.0.1                                           @amzn2-core
Feb 22 10:04:28 <dumbfrogonMint>	spine-o-saurus: you should call tech support. if its windows tech support they might say burning plastic smells are normal, and you need to buy an Xbox to solve the problem, and try to charge you $50 for their help
Feb 22 10:05:35 <Scissors>	dumbfrogonMint: :)
Feb 22 10:05:52 <Scissors>	dumbfrogonMint: how to fix broken power input? if any

Feb 22 10:08:01 <Scissors>	fdan: if .deb, it's dpkg -L rpmname |grep /usr/bin or so; I don't know if rpm
Feb 22 10:16:51 <dumbfrogonMint>	on the bright side, if your computer smells like burning plastic that kinda gives you a great reason to buy a new one. a good one that wont catch on fire.
Feb 22 10:21:56 <sjmulder>	my computer sometimes turns off when plugging in an HDMI cable. can't be right. but at least it's not on fire
Feb 22 10:23:49 <stevey_yant>	What's the other end of the cable connected to? A wall socket?
Feb 22 10:27:07 <dumbfrogonMint>	if youre using an HDMI cable to feed rap music into your laptop, it might shut down
Feb 22 10:27:39 <sjmulder>	just using a IEC 60906-1-to-HDMI adapter
Feb 22 10:27:49 <dumbfrogonMint>	or catch on fire, unless its stolen. then the rap music will pump out thge bass yo
Feb 22 10:28:46 <sjmulder>	kidding aside it's a desktop PC, I suppose something isn't isolated quite properly
Feb 22 10:29:26 <dumbfrogonMint>	HDMI cables are awesome. i think they might be replacing cat 6 eithernet cables. they have huge data speeds.
Feb 22 10:30:47 <dumbfrogonMint>	im not a computer expert but i do know HDMI cables, especially the short ones, can carry huge Gb speeds

Feb 22 10:40:34 <mlu>	dumbfrogonMint: it exposes a virtual 100Mbit ethernet interface over the HDMI cable, but it shares a pin with the audio
Feb 22 10:40:45 <mlu>	dumbfrogonMint: the other pins are strictly for the picture
Feb 22 10:40:50 <mlu>	** most of the pins

Feb 22 10:42:14 <Sparkles>	`su` there does not have `-P` option to create new pty. What is another adequate option?
Feb 22 10:42:24 <Sparkles>	/dev/stdout is owned by `root`.
Feb 22 10:43:52 <dumbfrogonMint>	mlu, and it sends the same signal twice, and compares the two and if there is a diffrence it wont function
Feb 22 10:47:50 <dumbfrogonMint>	it kinda makes you wonder how much data could be pushed throught a fiber optic line. it could be like a prism that spreads out all the colors. if you shine a bunch of diffrent colors of light into a prism it compresses it into one beam. then a prism on the other end could separate the light back out to individual colors
Feb 22 10:51:20 <dumbfrogonMint>	its kinda funny how the speed of light is known as 186,000 miles per second, but thats in the vacuum of space. the speed of light is massively slowed down when its electricity passing through a conductor or light through a fiber cable
Feb 22 10:53:12 <dumbfrogonMint>	i think the speed drops from 186,000 miles a second to about 50,000 miles a second. the speed of light in a vacuum is diffrent than the speed of light through a wire or glass fiber. obviously there is much more resistance to slow it down
Feb 22 10:58:18 <Scissors>	how can I fix cpu speed on max? cpufreq reports that it is max, but cat /proc/cpuinfo meows it isn't
Feb 22 10:59:39 <Sparkles>	Is it possible to sudo-change user and allow /dev/stdout?
Feb 22 10:59:52 <Sparkles>	Again, `su --pty` does not exist in this environment.
Feb 22 11:00:05 <boc_th>	cpupower-frequency-set -g performance
Feb 22 11:00:18 <Sparkles>	I have searched for 40 different Google links at least and nothing worked.
Feb 22 11:00:54 <Sparkles>	The command is: SHELL='/bin/bash' sudo su -ls '/bin/bash' - 'user';
Feb 22 11:01:11 <spine-o-saurus>	hot roding the cpu is great
Feb 22 11:01:38 <dumbfrogonMint>	google searches for help on linux sounds illogical.
Feb 22 11:01:53 <Sparkles>	This results in: "line 214: /dev/stdout: Permission denied" in some script then executed.
Feb 22 11:02:44 <dumbfrogonMint>	try the same search using duckduckgo and see what happens
Feb 22 11:02:46 <Scissors>	boc_th: nothing changes: cpufreq reports it's max, cat /proc/cpuinfo reports it near to bottom and fluctuates
Feb 22 11:04:58 <Sparkles>	dumbfrogonMint, nothing happened.
Feb 22 11:05:31 <colo>	xyzzy
Feb 22 11:06:03 <dumbfrogonMint>	you didnt get better results?
Feb 22 11:06:16 <sebek>	quit
Feb 22 11:06:21 <dumbfrogonMint>	please tell me they weren't 100% identical
Feb 22 11:06:33 <StucKman>	 /quit
Feb 22 11:07:23 <Sparkles>	dumbfrogonMint, I did not get better results. All the same links, and I am not sure why would it be better. SEO processing of Google is better.
Feb 22 11:07:39 <StucKman>	I'm trying to run quasselcore as a user. It's trying to read a PEM file with perms 600 but owned by the same user (mine) and it's getting EACCESS:
Feb 22 11:07:44 <StucKman>	statx(AT_FDCWD, "/home/mdione/local/var/lib/quassel/quasselCert.pem", AT_STATX_SYNC_AS_STAT|AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW, STATX_ALL, {stx_mask=STATX_ALL, stx_attributes=0, stx_mode=S_IFREG|0600, stx_size=5285, ...}) = 0
Feb 22 11:07:44 <StucKman>	openat(AT_FDCWD, "/home/mdione/local/var/lib/quassel/quasselCert.pem", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
Feb 22 11:08:20 <StucKman>	those two syscalls as registered by strace are executes one right after the other, and it's not like someone is changins the perms between them
Feb 22 11:08:37 <boc_th>	Scissors: are you trying to force p-states?
Feb 22 11:08:46 <boc_th>	you know you can't do that, right?
Feb 22 11:08:53 <Scissors>	boc_th: ?
Feb 22 11:09:08 <boc_th>	frequency boost, or whatever you call it
Feb 22 11:09:40 <boc_th>	at most, you can set the official top operational frequency, not the boost freq
Feb 22 11:09:57 <Scissors>	there is a 5 or 6 governors, which can't do that? How many governors gnu/linux need, to set cpu frequency to max?
Feb 22 11:10:17 <boc_th>	you can't set boost frequency
Feb 22 11:10:21 <Scissors>	I mean, official top operational frequenc
Feb 22 11:10:38 <boc_th>	performance
Feb 22 11:10:53 <Scissors>	there isseveral frequences available, and I wana that maximal of them be in /proc/cpuinfo
Feb 22 11:11:06 <Scissors>	perormance already set
Feb 22 11:12:12 <itt788>	anybody knows tips in imagemagick?
Feb 22 11:12:33 <itt788>	i want to give an effect to a photo
Feb 22 11:12:37 <StucKman>	itt788: maybe? what in particular?
Feb 22 11:12:42 <boc_th>	what available frequency steps are there?
Feb 22 11:12:51 <StucKman>	there is no #imagemagick channel?
Feb 22 11:12:59 <itt788>	make it look like printed on old or draft paper
Feb 22 11:13:06 <itt788>	lightly gray
Feb 22 11:13:10 <itt788>	and granulary
Feb 22 11:13:24 <StucKman>	I doubt IM can do such a thing
Feb 22 11:13:29 <itt788>	in #imagemagick they are in sleep mode
Feb 22 11:13:35 <StucKman>	I mean, probably yes, but it could take many steps
Feb 22 11:13:47 <dumbfrogonMint>	Sparkles: google is a company like any other company. i think it makes sense for them to kinda throw linux users under the bus. why help them? why help your competition. if anything, give them bad advice
Feb 22 11:13:49 <boc_th>	you're better off using ffmpeg
Feb 22 11:13:53 <boc_th>	imagemagick docs suck
Feb 22 11:13:55 <itt788>	imagemagick is magick
Feb 22 11:14:12 <itt788>	really
Feb 22 11:14:12 <dumbfrogonMint>	i would :) heh heh
Feb 22 11:14:13 <Sparkles>	dumbfrogonMint, I am not here to discuss nonsense.
Feb 22 11:14:14 <itt788>	?
Feb 22 11:14:54 <boc_th>	Scissors what available frequency steps are there?
Feb 22 11:16:14 <louipc>	dumbfrogonMint: well even microsoft helps linux to the extent that it serves them
Feb 22 11:16:18 <dumbfrogonMint>	sparkels, i get side tracked easily.
Feb 22 11:16:26 <MacGyver>	Scissors: /proc/cpuinfo is a single datapoint instant view of the CPU state. Even with performance governors, the CPU will clock down when it has nothing to do.
Feb 22 11:16:56 <boc_th>	^no, it shouldn't
Feb 22 11:17:00 <boc_th>	and doesn't for me
Feb 22 11:17:11 <MacGyver>	Scissors: turbostat will give you a better view of what is actually happening.
Feb 22 11:17:31 <dumbfrogonMint>	louipc, they are businesses. really good ones. that makes them predictable. im not saying its good or bad but it does make them predictable
Feb 22 11:17:39 *	Norkle pets the microsoft ball
Feb 22 11:18:53 <dumbfrogonMint>	alexa hears it and says look at some new products on sale
Feb 22 11:20:43 <farkaan>	Anyone use Budgie here? After updating I can't get Budgie Desktop Settings settings to work at all. Some of the settings work but most don't and the desktop's themes, window button placement and icons have reverted to the gnome defaults.
Feb 22 11:21:32 <mlu>	farkaan: use budgie -- seen the settings break on certain versions, fixed later
Feb 22 11:21:36 <louipc>	yea they gotta do what is profitable ultimately
Feb 22 11:22:17 <spine-o-saurus>	that was built for mobile devices
Feb 22 11:22:34 <farkaan>	mlu: ah shit okay. I'll try using gnome-tweaks but I doubt it will work either (since gsettings doesn't).
Feb 22 11:22:50 <farkaan>	First time this has happened to me though
Feb 22 11:23:53 <TuxJobs>	What does the "sd" stand for in "/dev/sdb"? "standard disk"? ChatGPT claims "scsi disk", but SCSI is that fancy, old standard for rich people, no?
Feb 22 11:24:44 <digdilem>	I kinda assumed sata. It used to be hdd for pata and changed around that time
Feb 22 11:24:50 <colo>	yeah, but it's still true ;)
Feb 22 11:25:04 <colo>	(SCSI, I mean)
Feb 22 11:25:15 <colo>	most modern-ish block devices adopted SCSI-style command sets
Feb 22 11:25:33 <colo>	and libata, at one point, decided to do away with the hdX node names for (P)ATA devices
Feb 22 11:26:18 <mlu>	TuxJobs: it stands for SCSI
Feb 22 11:26:32 <mlu>	TuxJobs: it was fancy, but it was just an instruction set, and SATA adapted the instruction set
Feb 22 11:26:44 <mlu>	TuxJobs: these days, the fancy stuff run on PCIe :)
Feb 22 11:27:37 <tsvallender>	And conveniently SATA also starts with an S :-)
Feb 22 11:28:00 <mlu>	serial :D
Feb 22 11:29:16 <AndyCap>	iirc it's a little more convoluted than just adopted the scsi command set.
Feb 22 11:29:26 <mlu>	this is why, on my fancy systems, a USB flash drive is /dev/sda :)
Feb 22 11:29:50 <mlu>	because my fancy systems have storage on either mmcblk or nvme0
Feb 22 11:30:03 <dumbfrogonMint>	farkaan, why did you choose Budgie?
Feb 22 11:30:04 <AndyCap>	and iirc it was the move from separate ide drivers to libata that was the cause of hda to sda
Feb 22 11:30:05 <mlu>	but the flash drive -- it speaks UASP -- USB Attached SCSI Protocol
Feb 22 11:30:11 <AndyCap>	mlu: lucky you.
Feb 22 11:30:30 <AndyCap>	not all of them do
Feb 22 11:30:42 <mlu>	AndyCap: I don't buy the cheap USB Mass Storage ones :P
Feb 22 11:31:32 *	mlu hides his bougie ass from AndyCap 
Feb 22 11:33:22 <AndyCap>	TuxJobs: but if you start digging in this, you're knee deep in standards from t10.org and t13.org :p
Feb 22 11:39:43 <dumbfrogonMint>	mlu, if you understand it keep digging :) i would
Feb 22 11:39:53 <dumbfrogonMint>	ill catch up heh heh
Feb 22 11:41:25 <dumbfrogonMint>	michel_c12, from c_14, is your name based on carbon?
Feb 22 11:43:30 <a51>	if I get a dual port nic, will I get two enps01 and enps02 ?
Feb 22 11:44:15 <colo>	depends a lot on the NIC, from my experience.
Feb 22 11:45:33 <colo>	but it's certainly within the realm of the possible :)
Feb 22 11:46:58 <a51>	for exemple in a dual port nic dedicate enps01 for host and enps02 for container
Feb 22 11:47:03 <a51>	does it make sense ?
Feb 22 11:48:09 <a51>	what is the best usecase on single pc of a dual or quad port nic ?
Feb 22 11:48:17 <ayecee>	it kinda seems like you didn't see the "depends a lot on the NIC"
Feb 22 11:48:38 <ayecee>	some are basically a single nic with a switch attached.
Feb 22 11:50:01 <a51>	I wanted to give dedicated physical ports for containers
Feb 22 11:50:18 <ayecee>	yeah you've said that a few times now
Feb 22 11:50:21 <a51>	if I have quad port nic
Feb 22 11:52:06 <colo>	a51: I would get the NIC first, and deal with the concrete impl. of your plan later
Feb 22 11:52:17 <ayecee>	multi-port nics are more often used for link aggregation, for greater speed or for fault tolerance. assigning nics to containers is unusual.
Feb 22 11:53:19 <colo>	ayecee: well, Ithink I can see how one would like to have dedicated ethernet links for container and non-container business for bw reasons. but yeah, it is kinda esoteric :)
Feb 22 11:54:06 <ayecee>	link aggregation would get you that already, plus fault tolerance.
Feb 22 11:54:40 <a51>	in single home with single pc does it make sense to have multi port nic ? but I plan to have at least 10 container-apps like postgresql-on-host,docker-nginx, docker-traefik,
Feb 22 11:54:50 <ayecee>	a51: no
Feb 22 11:54:54 <dumbfrogonMint>	im not an expert, but wouldn't duct taping a router onto the side of your desktop do the same thing
Feb 22 11:55:03 <ayecee>	dumbfrogonMint: no
Feb 22 11:55:13 <dumbfrogonMint>	and go faster? now you just need high speed
Feb 22 11:55:35 <xiaomiao>	a51: multiport would make sense if you have either multiple independent network segments, or a smart switch that can do channel bonding
Feb 22 11:55:57 <colo>	fwiw, one of the hosts I have access to with both a quad-port and a dual-port NIC has its interfaces look like this: http://paste.debian.net/plain/1308193 (the quad-port NIC, afaict, is actually two PCIe devices behind a PCIe switch on the card)
Feb 22 11:57:34 <a51>	I tought I could dedicate on dual port nic for exemple, one port for host (everyday internet browsing) and one port for serving (nginx,postgresql, etc) ?
Feb 22 11:57:58 <ayecee>	a51: you've said that a few times now.
Feb 22 11:58:07 <ayecee>	a51: are you reading, or only writing?
Feb 22 12:05:10 <dumbfrogonMint>	a51 is a scientist that works in Area 51
Feb 22 12:09:08 <Haxxa>	I am trying to limit internet usage on cellular (apart from NTP) what other data occurs over a stock debian install? I am not limiting anything so far.
Feb 22 12:10:12 <dumbfrogonMint>	testing 123
Feb 22 12:10:16 <ayecee>	nothing automated comes to mind.
Feb 22 12:11:01 <sphertext__>	feels like everyone on reddit recommends weechat over irssi
Feb 22 12:11:10 <colo>	automatic updates, if you elected to use them
Feb 22 12:11:11 <sphertext__>	makes me wonder if that means i should choose irssi
Feb 22 12:11:16 <Haxxa>	ayecee Was that response to me?
Feb 22 12:11:29 <Haxxa>	colo disabled unattended upgrades
Feb 22 12:11:59 <Haxxa>	I think default net install doesn't automatically update apt repos
Feb 22 12:12:24 <sphertext__>	https://tools.suckless.org/ii/
Feb 22 12:12:35 <dumbfrogonMint>	Haxxa, i have heard there are ways to stop "throttling" of data usage. i dont know how but i think it might be possible
Feb 22 12:12:56 <ayecee>	dumbfrogonMint: think you misunderstood the problem
Feb 22 12:13:14 <dumbfrogonMint>	on cell phones
Feb 22 12:14:09 <dumbfrogonMint>	sorry, im trying my best to keep up. i learn a lot just listening
Feb 22 12:14:19 <ayecee>	that's good. you should do more of that.
Feb 22 12:14:31 <dumbfrogonMint>	heh heh. well said
Feb 22 12:14:41 <dumbfrogonMint>	and f you man :)
Feb 22 12:15:12 <nullvalue>	ouch
Feb 22 12:16:38 <sphertext__>	suckless recommends irssi

Feb 22 12:21:46 <Norkle>	hah
Feb 22 12:21:51 <Norkle>	kewl!
Feb 22 12:22:30 <swift110-mobile>	Hey Norkle
Feb 22 12:22:59 <Norkle>	swift110-mobile: heyo
Feb 22 12:24:33 <dumbfrogonMint>	if you had to choose between Ubuntu- "popular and ultra secure", 2 gnome- "simple, beautiful, elegant", 3- kali- "penetration testing ethical hacking". which distro would you choose?
Feb 22 12:25:07 <spine-o-saurus>	i reject your reality and substitute my own
Feb 22 12:25:12 <Norkle>	neithers
Feb 22 12:25:32 <dumbfrogonMint>	mythbusters are legend
Feb 22 12:25:56 <neoncortex>	gnome is a distribution?
Feb 22 12:26:01 <Norkle>	chromebook linux VM is amazing to me
Feb 22 12:26:02 <ananke>	dumbfrogonMint: gnome is not a distro, and kali is a purpose specific one. without any requirements this is a silly question
Feb 22 12:26:12 <dumbfrogonMint>	they would pick all three and do some kind of experiments on theme
Feb 22 12:27:15 <dumbfrogonMint>	chromebook? disqualified
Feb 22 12:45:36 <dumbfrogonMint>	the linux hierarchy is sometimes difficult to understand. there is a lot of interconnected layers. i heard there is over 400 linux distros.
Feb 22 12:46:20 <dumbfrogonMint>	gnome might not be a distrio but mint relies on it heavily.
Feb 22 12:46:54 <psydroid>	why does the number of distros matter?
Feb 22 12:47:14 <psydroid>	there could be thousands of them and most would still be irrelevant to most people
Feb 22 12:51:22 <ananke>	dumbfrogonMint: doesn't matter whether a component is used heavily or not. gnome is not a distro, mint linux is.
Feb 22 12:51:31 <dumbfrogonMint>	over 400 distros doesnt really matter but it does kinda show there is a lsrge community of open source users.
Feb 22 12:52:23 <ananke>	and how is that relevant to the question you had?
Feb 22 12:52:41 <ananke>	or is this just a random tangent?
Feb 22 12:52:52 <dumbfrogonMint>	i know i use mint. it works great. its prob the most simple and best for new people transitioning from windows
Feb 22 12:53:42 <ananke>	I see, so just unfiltered random thoughts
Feb 22 12:54:42 <dumbfrogonMint>	i was jsut curious. i should have said if you could pick one, ubuntu, debian, or kali what would you choose. its aprob kinda a dumb question from a new guy
Feb 22 12:55:42 <bertvvvs>	If you don't know where you want to go. Any place is the right place.
Feb 22 12:58:42 <sbine>	dumbfrogonMint:ubuntu and kali are based on debian. which do you choose?
Feb 22 12:58:51 <dumbfrogonMint>	this is the right place.
Feb 22 12:59:33 <ananke>	'based on' is context specific. depending on perspective, it may mean a lot or very little
Feb 22 13:00:34 <ananke>	though the is still no context to the question at hand
Feb 22 13:03:36 <sbine>	ananke: dumbfrogonMint seems to be a new linux user, i think he's just searching the linux that fits like a glove for him, or maybe just curiosity
Feb 22 13:03:40 <indyZ>	dumbfrogonMint: I like debian unstable because it has the latest pacakges.
Feb 22 13:05:44 <dumbfrogonMint>	youre right. the only questions i could help answer are the questions about power cords and burning plastic smells.
Feb 22 13:08:42 <dumbfrogonMint>	sbine, ty. i kinda am newer than most people one here heh heh. i told someone to tape a router to their computer if they needed more ports
Feb 22 13:09:21 <techno75>	hello
Feb 22 13:09:56 <dumbfrogonMint>	how are you?
Feb 22 13:11:26 <dumbfrogonMint>	i think i could prob get a job working for microsoft tech support hotline
Feb 22 13:14:06 <ananke>	dumbfrogonMint: you may want to reconsider sharing your every thought with this channel
Feb 22 13:16:08 <dumbfrogonMint>	ananke: good advice.
Feb 22 13:17:03 <incal>	o/ sensors(1) ('sensors -j') now reports 'ERROR: Can't get value of subfeature in0_input: Can't read' and 'ERROR: Can't get value of subfeature in1_input: Can't read' for the CPU and GPU temperatures, this previously worked so don't know why it doesn't all of a sudden. ideas? TIA
Feb 22 13:19:27 <colo>	incal: sensors reads sysfs files and formats their content. running it under `strace` should tell you what goes wrong
Feb 22 13:24:09 <sbine>	incal: and what did you do on your system since sensors were working? An update?...
Feb 22 13:24:48 <incal>	colo, okay, 1s
Feb 22 13:25:09 <incal>	sbine, no idea since I didn't use it for some time, but I know it used to work
Feb 22 13:25:42 <sbine>	could be hardware related
Feb 22 13:26:43 <incal>	colo, https://dataswamp.org/~incal/error/sensors-j.txt
Feb 22 13:30:25 <dumbfrogonMint>	the hardware would have to have temp sensors on it. those prob are still working. sounds like a software prob
Feb 22 13:30:49 <colo>	seems like whatever driver handles those sysfs nodes has some kind of trouble
Feb 22 13:31:01 <colo>	nothing lm-sensors can do about that, though
Feb 22 13:31:19 <incal>	yeah, I wonder how that happened.
Feb 22 13:33:05 <incal>	maybe should as on gmane.linux.debian.user
Feb 22 13:38:56 <incal>	okay, done, let's see what they say

Feb 22 13:58:11 <drunkunclefrog>	there is a kali group on libera.chat.
Feb 22 13:58:53 <ananke>	Guest1985: so what's the question?
Feb 22 13:59:09 <drunkunclefrog>	what kali tools are you trying to use?
Feb 22 13:59:32 <ananke>	drunkunclefrog: how is that question even relevant at this point?

Feb 22 14:01:23 <ph88^>	I'm trying to make a systemd timer these are the files i have created https://bpa.st/ZIHA i have put the systemd .service and .timer file in /etc/systemd/system  I don't see the timer show up when i do systemctl list-timers   how can i install the timer correctly so that it shows up and runs? ubuntu 22.04
Feb 22 14:02:06 <brjl>	ph88^: Have you reloaded the daemon with the timers? systemctl daemon-reload
Feb 22 14:02:26 <ph88^>	brjl, yes
Feb 22 14:02:36 <rlikon>	ph88^: #systemd I just joined
Feb 22 14:02:52 <drunkunclefrog>	someone was asking about kali. a virtual machine on windows 11. im curious what their question is
Feb 22 14:03:22 <brjl>	ph88^: Your link is a 404
Feb 22 14:03:38 <drunkunclefrog>	forbiden
Feb 22 14:04:35 <ph88^>	brjl, it's ok #systemd helped
Feb 22 14:04:36 <rlikon>	we'll never know now.
Feb 22 14:08:16 <TuxJobs>	Problem: If I execute the command `/usr/bin/MyCustomApp-xterm -class MyCustomApp -e /usr/bin/php "/path/to/kickstarter.php"` in a terminal, it opens (as expected) an XTerm window which belongs to the "MyCustomApp" taskbar group in Plasma. However, if that *exact* command is set as the value for `ExecStart` under `[Service]` in `MyCustomApp.service`, it (upon boot) instead becomes part of the standard "XTerm" class/taskbar group. What could possibly explain
Feb 22 14:08:16 <TuxJobs>	this?
Feb 22 14:08:27 <TuxJobs>	By the way, `/usr/bin/MyCustomApp-xterm` is just a symlink/alias to "xterm", just so it's a different binary which is for some reason required to get different "groups" (simply specifying the -class is not enough).
Feb 22 14:22:34 <boc_th>	Yes, plasma is dumb like that.
Feb 22 14:24:35 <boc_th>	you can build something custom using the terminal widget
Feb 22 14:25:25 <boc_th>	a basic qt program that does that shouldn't be too hard to make
Feb 22 14:26:32 <forccon>	hi
Feb 22 14:26:46 <zanoh>	G'Day
Feb 22 14:26:50 <pell_>	forccon: hi
Feb 22 14:26:51 <forccon>	How can I get `DISPLAY=hostname:0` working?
Feb 22 14:27:19 <zanoh>	This feels like an XY question.
Feb 22 14:27:33 <forccon>	How can I setup a remote display, so I can run GUI applications using `DISPLAY=hostname:0`?
Feb 22 14:27:36 <TuxJobs>	boc_th: "shouldn't be too hard to make" <-- SHOULD not, no...
Feb 22 14:27:59 <TuxJobs>	Anyway, my question was about why the command works when I run it myself as a human in a terminal, but not when it's in the ExecStart.
Feb 22 14:28:29 <djph>	forccon: usually, SSH -Y user@host ; (check display is correct) ; run gui thing
Feb 22 14:28:47 <boc_th>	I mean shouldn't
Feb 22 14:28:49 <zanoh>	Is there a Qt based replacement for inkscape? I'm fed up with GTK and how they don't integrate into any none GNOME environment very well, so I want to one by one replace all of them.
Feb 22 14:29:08 <boc_th>	unless you can't program at all
Feb 22 14:29:29 <boc_th>	and answer to your question is it's because plasma is dumb
Feb 22 14:29:54 <TuxJobs>	boc_th: What are you even talking about?
Feb 22 14:30:13 <forccon>	djph, but that will execute remote applications on my local display
Feb 22 14:30:18 <forccon>	how can I do the other way around
Feb 22 14:30:24 <TuxJobs>	Maybe I should ask in #systemd, if it's related to it somehow.
Feb 22 14:30:35 <djph>	forccon: huh?
Feb 22 14:30:48 <pell_>	zanoh: I understand Krita has some vector tools, but probably not a complete replacement for advanced stuff
Feb 22 14:30:55 <djph>	forccon: you're trying to run something remote on the remote machine's display?
Feb 22 14:31:06 <boc_th>	TuxJobs: shouldn't and should not are the same thing, are you esl?
Feb 22 14:31:11 <forccon>	render applications on remote display
Feb 22 14:31:19 <TuxJobs>	boc_th: Stop insulting.
Feb 22 14:31:22 <madprops>	im confused about linux kernel sizes. I thought the kernel was pretty big but it seems it's only 13mb on my system. Is it the package for installation that is bigger?
Feb 22 14:31:23 <forccon>	not sure if even possible
Feb 22 14:31:52 <forccon>	can I run a local installation of xeyes but render it on a remote machine?
Feb 22 14:31:57 <boc_th>	TuxJobs: that's not an insult, just a normal question
Feb 22 14:31:57 <zanoh>	madprops, what distro? It's not unusual to split the kernel into multiple different packages.
Feb 22 14:32:10 <djph>	madprops: are you looking at the "vmlinuz" file?
Feb 22 14:32:19 <madprops>	zanoh, djph arch. I'm doing: du -h -m /boot/vmlinuz*
Feb 22 14:32:36 <djph>	forccon: no.
Feb 22 14:33:09 <TuxJobs>	boc_th: I'm not talking about compiling any QT programs. You must have confused two different questions.
Feb 22 14:33:23 <djph>	forccon: or rather, you'd need to ssh from "there" to "here" with the correct X-session stuff so that your machine sees it as a valid X server
Feb 22 14:34:43 <boc_th>	I haven't. If you want to be sure that plasma recognizes your program as separate from xterm, building a simple qt program is a good bet
Feb 22 14:34:46 <forccon>	When I do `ssh -X foo@bar.com app`, how can I get the DISPLAY environment variable value that is used?
Feb 22 14:35:39 <djph>	forccon: DISPLAY in that case *should* be the machine you're sitting at.
Feb 22 14:36:20 <djph>	or rather, the machine you're launching ssh from
Feb 22 14:36:59 <boc_th>	forccon: isn't it in env?
Feb 22 14:37:05 <samjiman>	Hi, all
Feb 22 14:37:16 <pell_>	samjiman: hi
Feb 22 14:37:44 <samjiman>	Hi, pell_
Feb 22 14:38:27 <samjiman>	I have a GRUB related question. Can I ask here or am I better off asking in #grub?
Feb 22 14:40:42 <pell_>	Doesn't hurt to ask. Somebody might know.
Feb 22 14:41:38 <samjiman>	Alright, thanks
Feb 22 14:41:50 <samjiman>	 I'm writing a script which runs under a chroot and am having a problem generating a full /boot/grub/grub.cfg configuration file, the BEGIN and END /etc/grub.d/10_linux section with the menu entries is missing. On UEFI, grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/efi --bootloader-id="Void" works fine under the chroot.
Feb 22 14:42:02 <samjiman>	For, context my function -> https://pastebin.com/vUiKMx71
Feb 22 14:42:09 <samjiman>	and the generated grub.cfg -> https://pastebin.com/UBKQk7D2
Feb 22 14:42:11 <samjiman>	Thanks
Feb 22 14:42:19 <samjiman>	This is on Void Linux
Feb 22 14:43:06 <espresso>	madprops: vmlinuz-linux https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel is 13M here, generated for the machine from linux ~130MB with modules and drivers
Feb 22 14:43:12 <pell_>	You must be trying to do a glibc chroot for a MUSL void install.
Feb 22 14:43:16 <Guest950>	hello
Feb 22 14:43:57 <samjiman>	No, it's a glibc chroot and I'm running the glibc x86_64 live image
Feb 22 14:45:37 <pell_>	Ah. I'm still new to Void. I've only done regular non-XFCE installs.
Feb 22 14:46:03 <samjiman>	It's alright. Thanks anyway.
Feb 22 14:46:56 <pell_>	I've been meaning to read the grub manual, but it's a book
Feb 22 14:46:57 <samjiman>	It's real PITA, I'd use UEFI that works fine on the VMs I tested, but my computer's handling of UEFI is a bit buggy so I'm using BIOS
Feb 22 14:50:02 <pell_>	The normal installatin doesn't work?
Feb 22 14:50:58 <samjiman>	It didn't work last time, but I needed to make some granular changes that void-installer doesn't support
Feb 22 14:51:25 <samjiman>	Also it's a learning exercise
Feb 22 14:52:10 <pell_>	I've done Linux From Scratch several times, but grub configuration is where things bog down for me.
Feb 22 14:52:58 <samjiman>	Maybe I can figure out why the UEFI installation didn't work on my PC
Feb 22 14:53:15 <pell_>	Does any other Linux install?
Feb 22 14:53:29 <pell_>	I had to change a setting in my boot menu to install Linux
Feb 22 14:53:34 <samjiman>	Yes, I installed Artix with BIOS okay
Feb 22 14:54:03 <samjiman>	I've installed Void with void-installer okay before, but last time it didn't work
Feb 22 14:54:14 <pell_>	Have you tried using the grub config from that installation as a reference?
Feb 22 14:55:19 <samjiman>	Yeah, they do:
Feb 22 14:55:20 <samjiman>	chroot $TARGETDIR grub-install $grub_args $dev
Feb 22 14:55:32 <samjiman>	chroot $TARGETDIR grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
Feb 22 14:55:55 <samjiman>	Maybe the trick is chroot from outside each time
Feb 22 14:56:02 <pell_>	That's from an installation that worked?
Feb 22 14:56:12 <samjiman>	That's from void-installer
Feb 22 14:56:35 <samjiman>	It's worked before
Feb 22 14:57:14 <pell_>	Hmmm. Did you update the firmware between when it worked and when it stopped working?
Feb 22 14:57:34 <pell_>	I wonder if some setting changed.
Feb 22 14:57:54 <samjiman>	No, I might just try using void-installer again on my physical machine
Feb 22 14:58:14 <samjiman>	It's just I really wanted to use my own script as I streamlined the options I want
Feb 22 14:58:30 <pell_>	Yes, I would use a grub config from a physical installation. It might be different.
Feb 22 14:58:45 <pell_>	Well, you can have a starting point to work from.
Feb 22 14:59:00 <samjiman>	Yes, it's different in that from my script the who menuentries aren't being generated
Feb 22 14:59:26 <samjiman>	I know that's why it doesn't work, but I don't know *why* they arent't generated in my script
Feb 22 14:59:26 <pell_>	I found grub confusing, but only because I hadn't read enough about all the details.
Feb 22 14:59:36 <pell_>	OK.
Feb 22 15:02:01 <samjiman>	I might end up using sed to insert the menu entries manually
Feb 22 15:02:18 <samjiman>	detecting the correct kernel images as necessary
Feb 22 15:02:34 <samjiman>	Anyway, appreciate the help. Thanks, pell_
Feb 22 15:03:38 <pell_>	You may have this already, but here's a link to the "book" documentation. https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/
Feb 22 15:04:02 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Feb 22 15:04:24 <pell_>	It's time to get off my behind and read it.
Feb 22 15:04:37 <pell_>	BluesKaj: hi
Feb 22 15:05:09 <BluesKaj>	hi pell_
Feb 22 15:06:12 <pell_>	I missed a few of your messages. Yeah, I would use sed too. The Void documentation recommends directly editing that config to add AppArmor support.
Feb 22 15:07:24 <pell_>	The point being that sometimes it has to be manually edited.
Feb 22 15:09:45 <pell_>	Good luck with that.
Feb 22 15:10:33 <samjiman>	@pell_: If chroot /mnt/ grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg doens't work for me, I'll just use sed
Feb 22 15:11:04 <samjiman>	Thanks :) I tried looking at the book too, but they just say grub-install $disk is enough when it's not haha
Feb 22 15:13:51 <Sparkles>	samjiman, due to how the most IRC clients work, I believe @ makes it don't work and members don't get notified.
Feb 22 15:13:53 <pell_>	Maybe something it needs is not installed or not in the right place.
Feb 22 15:14:15 <Sparkles>	There's no requirement on the most IRCd to prepend anything to usernames.
Feb 22 15:14:50 <Sparkles>	For example, do you receive a notification for @samjiman ?
Feb 22 15:17:30 <samjiman>	Sparkles: No, I didn't. You're right.
Feb 22 15:18:02 <samjiman>	pelle_: It must be that. I'm going to try installing grub outside of /mnt and then also mount the /etc
Feb 22 15:18:13 <samjiman>	before going into the chroot
Feb 22 15:18:59 <pell_>	Sparkles: Is there a way to highlight a response for a particular user here? One that still shows up in the public room?
Feb 22 15:19:58 <Sparkles>	Do you mean to reply to a specific message?
Feb 22 15:20:08 <pell_>	By highlight, I mean make it stand out so that user sees it. Or are we stuck with "user:"
Feb 22 15:20:40 <rascul>	just include the user's name somewhere in the message, pell_
Feb 22 15:20:45 <samjiman>	I'm using mIRC, it seems like something that custom scripts might solve.
Feb 22 15:23:14 <pell_>	Wow, mIRC. I haven't heard that name in a long time.
Feb 22 15:24:00 <samjiman>	Haha, I just installed it today, my old license from 2010 still works.
Feb 22 15:24:27 <samjiman>	I remember the selling point back in the days was the scripts. Other Windows clients didn't have the same support.
Feb 22 15:24:42 <samjiman>	Of course, *nix clients probably have similar features
Feb 22 15:25:13 <pell_>	I haven't chatted on Windows since college ages ago. At home it was Mac and then Linux.
Feb 22 15:26:35 <H4ndy>	mIRC was nice back then, regular updates, good support, scriping support and extensibility as much as you wanted
Feb 22 15:27:35 <suid_dumpable>	samjiman: yes, many irc clients have scripting features now. irssi for example.
Feb 22 15:28:24 <pell_>	I'm trying out clients right now. I've tried Hexchat and I'm on Irssi right now. But weechat looks nice.
Feb 22 15:29:23 <Sparkles>	It's just "user". The most clients just search for the username using regex rules with specificed delimiters. For example, Weechat I use has a function: https://github.com/weechat/weechat/blob/ef5ebc19e946efcbdf9cdf714a7d9250e6f975be/src/plugins/weechat-plugin.h#L1340
Feb 22 15:29:42 <Sparkles>	Here: https://github.com/weechat/weechat/blob/ef5ebc19e946efcbdf9cdf714a7d9250e6f975be/src/plugins/irc/irc-protocol.c#L3226
Feb 22 15:29:51 <Sparkles>	pell_ ^
Feb 22 15:30:08 <pell_>	Sparkles Ah. I see. Thanks
Feb 22 15:30:50 <pell_>	samjiman You're giving me flashbacks.
Feb 22 15:31:03 <Sparkles>	pell_, just in case, sending CTCP request to someone may reveal their client if supported by both IRCd and client and allowed by both.
Feb 22 15:31:15 <alih>	I'm thinking about trying Weechat but I'm on Hexchat right now. Basically so that I can keep the client running from my server
Feb 22 15:31:15 <Sparkles>	In case of Weechat, `/ctcp username VERSION`
Feb 22 15:32:05 <TuxJobs>	Why does `/usr/bin/MyCustomApp-xterm -class MyCustomApp -e blablabla` work if I run it in a terminal as a human, but not if it's set as the value for `ExecStart` under `[Service]` in `MyCustomApp.service`? Only by running it manually does it make the XTerm window go into the "MyCustomApp" taskbar group, as instructed. If run from the .service file, it instead becomes part of the "XTerm" group. What could be causing this?
Feb 22 15:34:31 <pell_>	TuxJobs When does that run? I wonder if there is an X session running at that point.
Feb 22 15:36:54 <pom>	 By highlight, I mean make it stand out so that user sees it. Or are we stuck with "user:"
Feb 22 15:38:28 <pell_>	TuxJobs Never mind. I just reread the end of that.
Feb 22 15:43:19 <samjiman>	@pell_: I asked around on #voidlinux too, but it looks like it works if i do it chroot grub-mkcfg rather than under the chroot prompt in the other script
Feb 22 15:43:32 <samjiman>	_pell_: Need to restart the VM to confirm
Feb 22 15:44:43 <pell_>	samjiman You mean running it without chrooting in?
Feb 22 15:45:00 <samjiman>	I mean by running it as a command under chroot
Feb 22 15:45:07 <samjiman>	rather than under the prompt
Feb 22 15:45:21 <samjiman>	rather than under the chroot prompt
Feb 22 15:45:47 <samjiman>	I get messages regarding the kernel images rather than before I got nothing
Feb 22 15:45:50 <pell_>	As part of the chroot command?
Feb 22 15:45:53 <samjiman>	Yes
Feb 22 15:46:07 <TuxJobs>	pell_: Well, After=network.target
Feb 22 15:46:07 <TuxJobs>	After=postgresql.service
Feb 22 15:46:12 <samjiman>	"chroot /mnt/ grub-install /dev/sda"
Feb 22 15:46:14 <samjiman>	then
Feb 22 15:46:37 <samjiman>	"chroot /mnt/ grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg"
Feb 22 15:47:39 <pell_>	I don't have enough experience with chroot to see why that would work different than chrooting first then running those commands without the chroot part
Feb 22 15:47:42 <TuxJobs>	I can't believe this kind of issue always has to happen with every little thing.
Feb 22 15:48:10 <samjiman>	pell_: It seems to be the same approach void-installer took
Feb 22 15:50:04 <pell_>	samjiman Well, that's a good sign.
Feb 22 15:50:36 <samjiman>	Thanks. Appreciate the help.
Feb 22 15:50:37 <espresso>	alternatively, https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-boot is easy to configure
Feb 22 15:51:18 <pell_>	samjiman I'm considering switching to MUSL on my main system, so I'll probably need a chroot environment for glibc for some things that don't work with MUSL unless I build them from souce.
Feb 22 15:51:22 <pell_>	source
Feb 22 15:52:06 <pell_>	But grub would not be an issue there
Feb 22 15:52:07 <samjiman>	One workaround is to use flatpaks
Feb 22 15:53:15 <espresso>	pell_: ah, i see now
Feb 22 15:53:49 <samjiman>	Maybe AppImages too, I think they bundle dependencies too
Feb 22 15:54:03 <TuxJobs>	I don't know if this is just in my head, but ChatGPT seems to have got *worse* with time. Every response now is full of made-up bullshit. Maybe I've just asked it all the "easy" questions...
Feb 22 15:54:03 <samjiman>	But I stuck with glibc for compatibility
Feb 22 15:54:08 <pell_>	I've used flatpaks for some things.
Feb 22 15:54:20 <samjiman>	I use it for Steam pretty much
Feb 22 15:54:28 <pell_>	I might stick with it too.
Feb 22 15:54:31 <samjiman>	I don't like how native Steam installs
Feb 22 15:54:39 <samjiman>	it messes up your home dir
Feb 22 15:56:12 <rascul>	how does it mess up your home dir?
Feb 22 15:56:23 <pell_>	I use a separate user directory for anything Wine related. I don't want to risk something wiping or spying on my main home directory
Feb 22 15:56:52 <pell_>	And that's with flatpaks
Feb 22 15:58:22 <samjiman>	@rascul: It just puts all these files and symbolic links under home
Feb 22 15:58:35 <samjiman>	Maybe I'm being hash, but I don't like ti
Feb 22 15:58:38 <samjiman>	*it
Feb 22 15:58:46 <rascul>	i see .steam/ .steampath and .steampid
Feb 22 15:58:55 <rascul>	do you see more?
Feb 22 16:00:26 <pell_>	espresso What?
Feb 22 16:00:49 <espresso>	pell_: you were not struggling with grub per se. Still waking up :)
Feb 22 16:02:36 <pell_>	espresso I have struggled with grub in the past. I need to learn it. Also, samjiman and I are using Void Linux. We don't have systemd
Feb 22 16:02:48 <espresso>	pell_: ah, i see
Feb 22 16:04:23 <pell_>	I did install elogind to get the power buttons in LightDM to work. elogind is a systemd project
Feb 22 16:07:13 <pell_>	samjiman I hope all goes will with that. I'm heading out now.
Feb 22 16:07:33 <samjiman>	pell_: Thanks, mate
Feb 22 16:07:33 <TuxJobs>	I can't believe the miserable state of computers.
Feb 22 16:07:35 <korn3r>	greetings, nerds
Feb 22 16:07:45 <samjiman>	pell_: See ya
Feb 22 16:07:51 <rascul>	my computers aren't in a miserable state
Feb 22 16:08:00 <pell_>	samjiman Next time.
Feb 22 16:08:01 <TuxJobs>	Yes, they are...
Feb 22 16:08:06 <rascul>	most of them are in mississippi and it's a fine state
Feb 22 16:12:51 <TuxJobs>	"Maybe all these issues will be fixed at some point"... Meanwhile, everything is broken. Can't move objects around freely on the Plasma desktop. The trashcan icon doesn't update when you empty it. The contents of the Dolphin window doesn't update until I press F5 or reopen it. Not possible to drag and drop files into a running mpv window from the desktop (but works from a Dolphin window). No "Open terminal here" on desktop context menu. No "Get path" when
Feb 22 16:12:51 <TuxJobs>	right-clicking a file on the desktop (but in a Dolphin view there is). Everything feels "sluggish" (just like modern Windows) because of all kinds of insane ideas of worse-than-useless "animations" for everything (tried to turn it all off). Installing/trying any theme puts you into Update Hell where no matter what you do it will keep downloading updates every day for themes you don't want and have long since removed. I could go on and on. It all
Feb 22 16:12:53 <TuxJobs>	contributes to a feeling of everything being in a broken and fragile state.
Feb 22 16:13:36 <rascul>	seems like you have issues with kde
Feb 22 16:14:03 <TuxJobs>	No. KDE is the least problematic DE.
Feb 22 16:14:14 <TuxJobs>	GNOME = entirely unusable by design. XFCE = crashy/glitchy so I had to switch to Plasma.
Feb 22 16:14:17 <rascul>	just about everything you listed there is a kde issue
Feb 22 16:14:39 <espresso>	TuxJobs: chatgpt? hopefully an anomaly. we can see that chatgpt tries to guess what is relevant and correct from a huge variety of data which can conflict or be incorrect or outdated. sometimes we can restate/disambiguate and get the precise answer, and sometimes have no idea what it's talking about :)
Feb 22 16:15:28 <nullie>	TuxJobs: the universe is miserable
Feb 22 16:15:55 <nullie>	it's all built on workarounds
Feb 22 16:16:07 <rascul>	do you live in an alternate universe? this one isn't miserable
Feb 22 16:16:39 <nullie>	you're just living in blissful ignorance
Feb 22 16:16:46 <rascul>	i am not
Feb 22 16:17:16 <brjl>	The universe "is", and it doesn't care what you think of it
Feb 22 16:20:36 <jeffreymichael>	maybe not in it
Feb 22 16:21:34 <rascul>	get out of it
Feb 22 16:28:01 <dviola>	TuxJobs: sounds like PEBKAC to me, I mean, no offense, but given your actual conversation in #systemd... it makes me think that you might want to reconsider what you are doing
Feb 22 16:28:17 <espresso>	TuxJobs: my experience.. Dolphin can *occasionally* not update (busy IO? not sure). switching to Folder View, I can move desktop icons, drag them to mpv (but some folder may crash it?). no Konsole context menu (but possibly this could be changed in a desktop entry?) and no 'Copy Location'. I have always been able to turn off all animations and themes seem to behave.. Maybe one or more things missing or broken (and may be on bug tracker)
Feb 22 16:29:06 <Sparkles>	brjl, it does. The universe consits of them, me, and you. It may not be visible, but it surely affects now, or will in the future. It's all interconnected, isn't it.
Feb 22 16:33:52 <ZAJDAN>	hi...did anybody try SLES 15.3 install on ProxMox?
Feb 22 16:42:26 <Jersten>	Hi all, linux newb here. I just restarted my Manjaro computer, and now it won't give me any video. So I installed a different AMD card, and I get a motherboard splash screen now. But then just a black screen. There's a video signal coming through, because the monitor stays on. But Manjaro just never loads.
Feb 22 16:42:40 <Jersten>	Any ideas what could cause this?
Feb 22 16:44:15 <Khaytsus>	TuxJobs: Your endless blogging of issues nobody else ever has never gets hold.........
Feb 22 16:44:20 <Khaytsus>	..old
Feb 22 16:44:49 <boc_th>	Manjaro is the only distro that ever irreparably broke itself on me, just by pressing the update button.
Feb 22 16:45:28 <boc_th>	Maybe there are some other factors, but I'm going to blame Manjaro here
Feb 22 16:45:45 <boc_th>	2/10, would not recommend
Feb 22 16:45:52 <Elw3>	Maybe its simply not loading a gui, try to get to a tty maybe and check
Feb 22 16:46:33 <Elw3>	Thats crtl+alt+ randomly mashing F keys for the newbs here.
Feb 22 16:46:37 <espresso>	Jersten: If a bootable installer works, but two cards give the same result, it seems to suggest OS configuration. Viewing boot log could explain what went wrong..
Feb 22 16:54:23 <TuxJobs>	espresso: It literally makes up nonexistent parameters/flags for commands that one would EXPECT to exist, but which actually don't.
Feb 22 16:54:42 <Jersten>	espresso: Yes I just plugged in another manjaro drive, and everything works fine. The last time I had this happen to me, it was because I somehow got switched over to Wayland, and I needed to be on X11
Feb 22 16:54:53 <TuxJobs>	dviola: "it makes me think that you might want to reconsider what you are doing" <-- Huh?
Feb 22 16:55:47 <Khaytsus>	Jersten: You generally should still see grub, bootup stuff, etc
Feb 22 16:56:25 <TuxJobs>	Khaytsus: You have no idea whether "nobody else ever has" the same issues. All you know is what you see in #Linux, which is an extremely small sample, and when somebody does type a message, you scold them for "blogging" as you call it.
Feb 22 16:56:33 <Khaytsus>	dviola: Please don't pull topics from other channels into this one, but if you have some concern about cross-channel noise/topics/etc you could let us know in #linux-ops
Feb 22 16:57:08 <boc_th>	Jersten: my recommendation is to pick another distro and ditch manjaro. ubuntu, mint, fedora, suse will all be an improvement stability wise
Feb 22 16:57:37 <Jersten>	Khaytsus: Well I'm not sure if I have grub set to show itself. Most of the time I would only see the motherboard splash screen, and then a black screen, and then the login prompt for Manjaro. Now I simply never get the login prompt, just a black screen.
Feb 22 16:58:16 <Khaytsus>	Jersten: Ah, possible it hides all that by default for a "seamless boot" or such.. can always hold shift or such to see grub though
Feb 22 16:58:17 <Jersten>	boc_th: I like arch though and I like pamac. Otherwise I wouldn't have any problem switching
Feb 22 16:58:26 <boc_th>	then use arch
Feb 22 16:58:28 <boc_th>	not manjaro
Feb 22 16:58:43 <boc_th>	From what I gathered, even arch users don't like majaro
Feb 22 16:58:50 <Jersten>	boc_th: Arch is known to be more stable than Manjaro?
Feb 22 16:58:55 <Khaytsus>	TuxJobs: You do use #linux as your griping blog.  Have for a year now.
Feb 22 17:00:01 <boc_th>	By who? When I was asking around several people confirmed that my experience is far from unique and claimed that arch is better
Feb 22 17:00:26 <Jersten>	Khaytsus: Ok so once I've made it into grub, which setting should I look for? Perhaps there's one where I can verify that I'm on X11 and not wayland. Or maybe I need to get the boot log?
Feb 22 17:00:36 <brjl>	Jersten: https://github.com/arindas/manjarno
Feb 22 17:00:48 <boc_th>	Jersten remove quite from the line
Feb 22 17:00:51 <boc_th>	*quiet
Feb 22 17:01:04 <Khaytsus>	Jersten: Oh, no..  Just saying that would show you grub, not that it'd affect your Wayland defaults etc.  You could try booting an older kernel though in case it's something related to that.
Feb 22 17:01:05 <boc_th>	"c" to edit boot entry
Feb 22 17:01:46 <boc_th>	if you don't see text going across screen, remove quiet from kernel params
Feb 22 17:02:06 <boc_th>	that may give you some hint
Feb 22 17:02:27 <boc_th>	or "e"? It should be somewhere on grub screen
Feb 22 17:04:56 <Siecje>	I added a new virtual disk to a VM. I mounted it and used it yesterday. Today it wasn't mounted. When I did mount it there are no files. I am trying to git clone the same repo as yesterday and I'm getting fatal: multiple updates for ref errors. Are there files that I can't see?
Feb 22 17:05:56 <dviola>	Khaytsus: ok
Feb 22 17:06:21 <dviola>	my bad, apologies
Feb 22 17:06:40 <Khaytsus>	Siecje: Unlikely files you "can't see" no..  You sure you mounted the same thing the same way, etc?  Actually mounted (check with df/mount/whatever)
Feb 22 17:06:51 <Khaytsus>	dviola: No worries, just don't want cross-channel drama causing stirs.
Feb 22 17:07:26 <Siecje>	Khaytsus: Shows 24% used.
Feb 22 17:07:27 <boc_th>	depending on how violently the VM was shut down, it's possible that the FS failed to sync
Feb 22 17:07:58 <Khaytsus>	Siecje: As root do a find on the mountpoint?  Like /mnt/yournewdrive or whatever?
Feb 22 17:08:12 <Siecje>	I see a mount point in lsblk.
Feb 22 17:08:39 <Khaytsus>	That's a device, not a mount point
Feb 22 17:08:51 <Siecje>	the last column is MOUNTPOINTS.
Feb 22 17:09:02 <Khaytsus>	Ah okay fair enough
Feb 22 17:09:04 <Siecje>	Which command should I run?
Feb 22 17:09:11 <Siecje>	vdb                       252:16   0   80G  0 disk /media/vdb
Feb 22 17:09:18 <Khaytsus>	find /media/vdb
Feb 22 17:09:49 <Siecje>	that directory and files are shown.
Feb 22 17:10:06 <Khaytsus>	um...
Feb 22 17:10:16 <Siecje>	sudo ls -la is empty though.
Feb 22 17:10:31 <Khaytsus>	pastebin the find output?
Feb 22 17:10:45 <Khaytsus>	At least some partial output or whateer, don't need thousands of lines
Feb 22 17:11:12 <Siecje>	https://dpaste.org/aDfsW
Feb 22 17:11:43 <Khaytsus>	Siecje: And if you just cd /media/vdb and ls you don't see buildroot etc?
Feb 22 17:11:45 <bparker>	mdogg: np, also beware that there's multiple versions of rename used in different distros, there's at least one from util-linux and another perl-based one, maybe more. also see vidir :)
Feb 22 17:12:11 <Siecje>	Khaytsus: correct.
Feb 22 17:12:21 <Khaytsus>	Siecje: As root?
Feb 22 17:13:14 <Khaytsus>	I don't quite understand how that's possible honestly...
Feb 22 17:13:51 <Siecje>	I don't think I have a root user.
Feb 22 17:14:21 <Khaytsus>	Just for giggles can you do this?  sudo -s (so you remain root), cd /media/vdb; ls -la ; find .             and pastebin again some first 10 or whatever lines of the output of those total?
Feb 22 17:14:24 <Siecje>	I don't really need those files. Should I just clone into a new directory?
Feb 22 17:14:33 <Siecje>	kk
Feb 22 17:14:56 <Siecje>	It's there as root.
Feb 22 17:15:00 <Khaytsus>	sudo (without specifying the user) is uid 0..  which is what I mean when I say "root user"
Feb 22 17:15:16 <Khaytsus>	Odd, I guess your normal user can't read that path, although I would have thought you'd get some permission error
Feb 22 17:15:28 <Siecje>	https://dpaste.org/KF3v7
Feb 22 17:15:39 <Siecje>	my user owns the directory.
Feb 22 17:15:57 <Khaytsus>	chown the path as needed..  like if you want your user having full access to that drive, just chown you.you /media/vdb or whatnot
Feb 22 17:16:22 <bparker>	I only even learned about -s the other day when people were arguing about it. I always used "sudo su - -c command" like a dumdum
Feb 22 17:16:44 <rascul>	sudo -i is more like su -
Feb 22 17:16:49 <rascul>	sudo -s is more like su
Feb 22 17:16:53 <Khaytsus>	I use sudo sudo sudo sudo -s for uid 0000
Feb 22 17:17:36 <Jersten>	Khaytsus: Well when I hold shift, I get some kind of Manjaro menu. I can choose to load it normally, which gives me the black screen. Or I can choose some other options to load it, which does load Manjaro thankfully. But my desktop config is reset to default and everything is small.
Feb 22 17:17:45 <Khaytsus>	Siecje: One more time, for....  my curiousity if you don't mind.  Without sudo, ie: as your code user, do the same and pastebin the same..  cd /media/vdb; ls -la ; find .
Feb 22 17:18:02 <jmd>	How do I use the /dev/watchdog device ?
Feb 22 17:18:17 <Khaytsus>	Jersten: No idea what "options" those are, not ever havin gused Manjaro, maybe the other is some safe mode, or basic graphics, or?
Feb 22 17:18:32 <Khaytsus>	jmd: Usually some app/service uses it
Feb 22 17:18:50 <jmd>	Khaytsus: And how does it do that?
Feb 22 17:19:22 <Khaytsus>	jmd: How does what do what?  If you want to know how watchdog functions, I'm sure there are excellent google references ;)
Feb 22 17:19:28 <Jersten>	boc_th: I would switch to endeavorOS, but it claims to be "terminal centric". Definitely not looking for that, since I am a newb having only switch to Linux a couple of months ago. And I don't want to get away from the Arch repos. My problem with arch was that it was too bare.
Feb 22 17:20:02 <jmd>	Khaytsus: You don't know. Okay.
Feb 22 17:20:17 <Khaytsus>	Cool
Feb 22 17:20:29 <Jersten>	I couldn't install all the stuff I needed because it wouldn't let me. It always said something like "You have to have this". So I'd finally find that and it would say "Well you can't install that because you don't have this". It was laughable and manjaro solved it cause I can use the AUR and it doesn't give me those problems
Feb 22 17:20:58 <espresso>	Jersten: pacman normally lets you install the dependencies along with a package
Feb 22 17:21:59 <Siecje>	Khaytsus: https://dpaste.org/s5Caz
Feb 22 17:22:18 <boc_th>	Jersten: there's no such thing as a free lunch.
Feb 22 17:22:24 <Siecje>	I mounted with sudo mount /dev/vdb /media/vdb
Feb 22 17:22:49 <boc_th>	ubuntu is does thing the way it does for a reason, and it's pretty reliable as a result
Feb 22 17:24:09 <boc_th>	other more flexible distros are pretty stable too, but are harder to admin
Feb 22 17:24:27 <boc_th>	like gentoo
Feb 22 17:24:46 <preach>	>reliable
Feb 22 17:26:25 <boc_th>	or you can use debian stable like preach, if you don't mind half a decade old software
Feb 22 17:27:02 <Thuryn>	anybody here using splunk?  the #splunk channel is a graveyard.
Feb 22 17:28:05 <xiaomiao>	Thuryn: it tends to be a money pit, so I rarely see it used
Feb 22 17:28:20 <preach>	lol debian
Feb 22 17:29:01 <Thuryn>	xiaomiao, yeah it's not free, but it has been worth it to us
Feb 22 17:29:43 <xiaomiao>	Thuryn: I've used it a bit in the past, it's kinda nice, but e.g. grafana covers a lot of the same problem space
Feb 22 17:29:52 <Thuryn>	i'm working on the Splunk_TA_Windows app and i could use some help and/or advice on its config
Feb 22 17:31:15 <rascul>	i like grafana
Feb 22 17:31:25 <rascul>	i have all sorts of pretty graphs and i even know what some of them are for
Feb 22 17:31:27 <xiaomiao>	I like opensource
Feb 22 17:31:36 <xiaomiao>	not that I want to debug, but usually I have to debug
Feb 22 17:31:43 <rascul>	sometimes when i'm stoned i like to just watch my pretty graphs for awhile
Feb 22 17:31:59 <Thuryn>	the previous admin set this up so that it pulls in all events from the Event Log, and then excludes specific undesirable event IDs.
Feb 22 17:32:10 <Thuryn>	I want to invert that and only include certain event IDs.
Feb 22 17:32:14 <espresso>	careful use of wiki.archlinux.org should help solve most issues there, but can be a lot to take in if unfamiliar.
Feb 22 17:34:31 <FlorianBad>	No reason for ext4 journal size to be any different if it is in a LUKS LVM?
Feb 22 17:37:03 <Siecje>	Khaytsus: Another piece of data. If I'm my user and in /media/vdb and then sudo -s and then I'm in the same dir and do ls -la I don't see it. if I cd /media/vdb; ls -la I see it.
Feb 22 17:38:11 <psydroid>	Debian has 3 distributions: stable, testing and unstable
Feb 22 17:38:20 <psydroid>	so you can pick the poison you need/want
Feb 22 17:50:23 <FlorianBad>	At what size of partition is  `-O 64bit`  justified for mkfs.ext4 ?

Feb 22 18:38:53 <xx>	TuxJobs: systemd services run in a different scope, likely without access to the running xserver unless you do some more configuration
Feb 22 18:39:00 <xx>	or they start too early
Feb 22 18:39:09 <xx>	in any case what you're doing is the wrong approach
Feb 22 18:39:36 <xx>	I have literally >10 scripts running right now, with output into logfiles, each being displayed in a different terminal window, all at the time time, on separate computer screens
Feb 22 18:39:42 <xx>	and I don't use xterm for that
Feb 22 18:40:00 <Random6>	Hello
Feb 22 18:43:30 <twainwek>	is man ubuntu download page down
Feb 22 18:45:21 <AndyCap>	twainwek: there are services on the internet you can use to check https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/
Feb 22 18:46:19 <twainwek>	my bad. by down i meant broken link
Feb 22 18:46:40 <twainwek>	its 404ing on me
Feb 22 18:49:20 <Random6>	Dreaded 404
Feb 22 18:49:45 <oerheks>	https://status.canonical.com/ all up .. maybe your mirror only?
Feb 22 18:49:54 <oerheks>	or, just in sync
Feb 22 18:50:02 <oerheks>	try again in a minute
Feb 22 18:51:06 <bparker>	lol that site monitors piracy providers
Feb 22 18:53:54 <Random6>	Anyone know if kali linux tools can be installed within all linux distrobutions?
Feb 22 18:54:15 <Random6>	* I'd like to install kali linux tools in puppy linux :
Feb 22 18:54:17 <Random6>	:)
Feb 22 18:55:14 <JanC>	bparker: what do you mean "piracy providers" ?
Feb 22 18:55:17 <Siecje>	Khaytsus: I think it was because I was in the directory before I mounted it.
Feb 22 18:56:55 <oerheks>	Random6, kali tools wreck your system to root only, have fun!
Feb 22 18:57:17 <AndyCap>	I thought kali just had linux tools.
Feb 22 18:57:19 <Random6>	Can I ask you something oerheks?
Feb 22 18:57:41 <Random6>	Why would you leave an open-ended statement, that you know will likely lead to additional questions?
Feb 22 18:58:17 <brjl>	That's how conversations start
Feb 22 18:58:28 <Random6>	?
Feb 22 18:58:37 <Random6>	How will Kali Tools wreck my Linux system?
Feb 22 18:58:52 <Rock_Kickass>	wreck your system to root only?
Feb 22 18:59:04 <Random6>	^ exactly - what does that even mean?
Feb 22 18:59:05 <oerheks>	it changes behaviour, so the rest of your system may function differently
Feb 22 18:59:12 <Random6>	Oh ok
Feb 22 18:59:22 <oerheks>	e.g. running an irc client will be root
Feb 22 18:59:24 <Rock_Kickass>	you got examples?
Feb 22 18:59:27 <Rock_Kickass>	no
Feb 22 18:59:31 <Rock_Kickass>	not true
Feb 22 18:59:34 <Rock_Kickass>	next
Feb 22 18:59:55 <Random6>	I have installed Kali Tools inside Mint before, didn't notice any changes...
Feb 22 19:00:02 <Random6>	But I am a noobie
Feb 22 19:01:16 <AndyCap>	Random6: are you talking about this kali? https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms or something else?
Feb 22 19:01:47 <hellokittycat>	Anyone want to share the skinny on how to magically reduce i/o time wait on a Linux host? I once and for all figured out that the latency from my mounted external LAN and WAN drives is what is causing such poor performance and what looked like a RAM bottleneck ...
Feb 22 19:02:35 <AndyCap>	hellokittycat: unless something is wrong, you need faster drives, and possibly faster connection for those drives?
Feb 22 19:02:45 <oerheks>	just run kali in a VM.
Feb 22 19:02:56 <xiaomiao>	hellokittycat: readahead can hide some latency sometimes
Feb 22 19:02:58 <hellokittycat>	Well, so the internal drive is an SSD
Feb 22 19:03:04 <hellokittycat>	The external is a gaming HDD
Feb 22 19:03:24 <hellokittycat>	So then it's probably the external drive. Who can afford the cost of a 2 TB NAS SSD though?
Feb 22 19:03:28 <hellokittycat>	That's just so expensive!
Feb 22 19:03:47 <hellokittycat>	The iowait is at 35.5% now
Feb 22 19:03:50 <AndyCap>	hellokittycat: then rework how you're using them.
Feb 22 19:03:59 <Random6>	Yeah I think running kali linux in a VM would be a much better way to do it
Feb 22 19:04:06 <hellokittycat>	The cores are at about 5.70 load with a 4-core Intel CPU
Feb 22 19:04:07 <AndyCap>	hellokittycat: so what needs to be fast gets to live on local fast storage
Feb 22 19:04:09 <xiaomiao>	hellokittycat: and for example NFS supports cachefilesd
Feb 22 19:04:27 <hellokittycat>	These are ... Hold on. I'll tell you how they are mounted
Feb 22 19:04:41 <AndyCap>	hellokittycat: also, doing this over wan is going to suck,
Feb 22 19:04:46 <xiaomiao>	hellokittycat: is the network the bottleneck?
Feb 22 19:05:15 <Sparkles>	Kali is a very special distro modified specifically for its purpose. Even Backtrack back the was not so custom as Kali. Hope you sure what you do.
Feb 22 19:05:33 <TuxJobs>	xx: I have no idea about the details of your setup, but that's not what I have/want. And I only have one physical screen. And it's not even 4K.
Feb 22 19:05:49 <TuxJobs>	xx: What do you mean by they run in a different "scope"?
Feb 22 19:05:59 <hellokittycat>	I think it is an FTP mount via curlftpfs
Feb 22 19:06:11 <hellokittycat>	Because that router won't mount ssh that way ... that's the only option I had
Feb 22 19:06:21 <TuxJobs>	xx: The .service file also has: After=network.target
Feb 22 19:06:21 <TuxJobs>	After=postgresql.service
Feb 22 19:06:39 <TuxJobs>	xx: But obviously it does run, since it starts the script in an XTerm. It's just the wrong group in the taskbar.
Feb 22 19:06:48 <xiaomiao>	hellokittycat: that's wonderfully horrible
Feb 22 19:07:01 <hellokittycat>	It's the only option I have, man.
Feb 22 19:07:01 <xiaomiao>	hellokittycat: why don't you use something more traditional like, uh, maybe ... NFS ?
Feb 22 19:07:14 <hellokittycat>	I know it's not optimal but I have to deal with the non-commerical Asus router.
Feb 22 19:07:34 <xiaomiao>	oh, you have storage attached to an underpowered appliance?
Feb 22 19:07:40 <xiaomiao>	that's usually "very not fun"
Feb 22 19:07:49 <hellokittycat>	Because when I was doing that the mount wasn't stable enough to play the media files on Nautilus or even the CLI.
Feb 22 19:08:04 <hellokittycat>	The connection would constantly drop, the buffer would run out
Feb 22 19:09:19 <dragonmaster>	there is no magic to combine underperforming pieces into a whole that performs well
Feb 22 19:09:32 <twainwek>	anyone have experience with openvpn AS? Question: for a '<net1> <-> <AS server> <-> <net2>' setup, would setting the AS server itself on a remote machine require using up one "client" connection
Feb 22 19:09:40 <hellokittycat>	I'm looking to see what this makeshift server can do ... it's not really a server. You can call it that in the server client relationship but it's really a jerry rigged Asus router with a gaming drive.
Feb 22 19:10:11 <hellokittycat>	Yeah, so it's not showing NFS for an option. That means it was mounted with Samba for SMB compatibility
Feb 22 19:10:14 <hellokittycat>	And it was running like hell.
Feb 22 19:11:01 <hellokittycat>	I had it to where I would type the IP in Nautilus, it would show up, but then I'd play stuff and the buffer was crap. It would randomly close VLC - among other things. That's when I finally figured out that curlftps works
Feb 22 19:12:20 <AndyCap>	hellokittycat: okay then, nothing can make this fast. :)
Feb 22 19:13:26 <hellokittycat>	Yeah, so I am reading about NFS as only this Linux host can use it - among everything in my house. I'm sure the Windows host can do it, but I'm reading: so it's the Linux analog to SMB for Windows... without the bastardized ways of Samba
Feb 22 19:14:28 <hellokittycat>	Samba itself isn't a cheap replica but the ways in which it processes SMB have proven inefficient. I actually think Samba is great, especially when it does things like fulfill AD roles
Feb 22 19:14:54 <korn3r>	Windows has nfs client, but you better not try that. It works fine untill disk becomes inaccessible. Then it feels like NFS client hangs whole system.
Feb 22 19:14:58 <hellokittycat>	Well, thanks anyway, man. I appreciate you taking the time to hear me, AndyCap
Feb 22 19:15:04 <micmalti>	Depending on the use case but if it
Feb 22 19:15:05 <hellokittycat>	Yeah, that's what I'm saying
Feb 22 19:15:29 <hellokittycat>	Windows trying to do Linux things like SSH and Linux trying to do Windows things like SMB... it's asking for trouble.
Feb 22 19:15:50 <micmalti>	... is only for quick file transfers, I'd use sshfs
Feb 22 19:15:51 <rocks>	Linux handles SMB mounts just fine, if you don't care about file ownership or permissions
Feb 22 19:16:18 <AndyCap>	hellokittycat: worrying about implementation of Samba is pretty nuts when you're actually using curlftpfs  on an underpowered asus router. you need to have some perspective
Feb 22 19:17:30 <Khaytsus>	Siecje: Oooff, that's all it was, you hadn't cd'ed into it again?
Feb 22 19:17:35 <hellokittycat>	Even something so simple as starting an sftp session from Linux to Windows - I think it requires some weird character following a   delimiter... like if you try to sftp starting at a  specific location other than the default.
Feb 22 19:17:48 <Siecje>	Khaytsus: I didn't know I needed to.
Feb 22 19:18:07 <Siecje>	And when I sudo -s I followed your directory to cd even though I was in that directory.
Feb 22 19:18:23 <rocks>	-i is better than -s
Feb 22 19:18:25 <Khaytsus>	Siecje: Yeah, you were in the mount point directory, once you mount it, that logically points somewhere else but the original mount point directory still exists.
Feb 22 19:18:27 <hellokittycat>	I think ... I have to conclude, when you say that... You have clearly worked in environments with more than abundantly sufficient equipment
Feb 22 19:18:28 <Siecje>	Thanks for helping me learn something.
Feb 22 19:18:46 <Khaytsus>	Siecje: Yeah I hadn't even considered that, mostly because I was asking you to explicitly cd to it :D
Feb 22 19:19:00 <hellokittycat>	Everything I do is at home so these comments - not just you but from many people - about using subpar methods or hack protocols.... while they are true and warranted. I just don't have access to good stuff
Feb 22 19:19:36 <Siecje>	rocks: It doesn't work for me. https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Siecje/22e01ac114a382d03e2358f8188963f0/raw/43ca025081992d6485c8d69d969425009a1a6924/gistfile1.txt
Feb 22 19:19:58 <hellokittycat>	I learned how to manage Linux files at home - not at work. The scripting I have done is always at home.... it's all at home. Because of a variety of factors - most of which are off topic - I can't learn at work.
Feb 22 19:20:29 <AndyCap>	hellokittycat: no, you were the one calling samba bastardized and smb inefficient,
Feb 22 19:20:33 <tusko>	sometimes it be's like that
Feb 22 19:20:38 <bparker>	lol
Feb 22 19:20:40 <bparker>	popcorn time
Feb 22 19:20:53 <hellokittycat>	Yeah, I should ... I will try to be more friendly.
Feb 22 19:21:25 <nullvalue>	to samba!!
Feb 22 19:21:29 <AndyCap>	hellokittycat: yet you're using stuff that is orders of magnitude worse in both efficiency and suitability to your task
Feb 22 19:21:33 <hellokittycat>	It is me saying things like that which ... well, it alienates other people and comes off as arrogant. Then if you have considerably more experience than me, it not only comes off as arrogant but just wrong.
Feb 22 19:21:35 <tusko>	samba is sus
Feb 22 19:21:35 <hellokittycat>	So I hear you
Feb 22 19:21:42 <nullvalue>	very sus
Feb 22 19:22:17 <hellokittycat>	My experiences are severely limited and because of these limitations, I see the protocols do things that you just don't in a full scale production environment
Feb 22 19:22:26 <hellokittycat>	For instance, and this is a good example.
Feb 22 19:22:46 <bparker>	the latest samba actually can use plain TLS and work just fine over the internet
Feb 22 19:22:52 <bparker>	latest smb*
Feb 22 19:22:58 <rocks>	Being upset at people who tell you that your inadequate hardware is inadequate is just odd
Feb 22 19:23:13 <hellokittycat>	If you install a variety of distros on a VM like VirtualBox, they will do well, but they do not perform in many ways as they would on bare metal. So trying to conclude something based on those emulated environments will lead to observations which are either incorrect or misleading.
Feb 22 19:23:28 <bparker>	rocks: some people either like old hardware, or can't afford new ones. that's no reason to punch down though
Feb 22 19:23:47 <rocks>	Meanwhile people run production environments mostly on virtual machines these days unless they specifically need not to
Feb 22 19:23:48 <hellokittycat>	I am wishing I never said that about Samba
Feb 22 19:23:54 <tusko>	an OS would likely not do well on metal. not even sure how you would apply it
Feb 22 19:24:02 <bparker>	lolwut
Feb 22 19:24:10 <hellokittycat>	I do that a lot. I say something is crap or it's subpar and someone who relies on it and has found it to be mostly good gets upset about it.
Feb 22 19:24:27 <korn3r>	smb over the internet... pls no
Feb 22 19:24:34 <bparker>	maybe don't make sweeping generalizations
Feb 22 19:24:43 <hellokittycat>	I can leave, man
Feb 22 19:24:52 <hellokittycat>	I seriously did not want this acrimony
Feb 22 19:24:53 <bparker>	korn3r: works on my machine (TM)
Feb 22 19:24:55 <hellokittycat>	I'm disinterested in it
Feb 22 19:25:00 <hellokittycat>	It does nothing for both me and you
Feb 22 19:25:29 *	rocks wonders if shrink hour is up yet so he can go and get a coffee
Feb 22 19:25:36 <hellokittycat>	Also, I'm likewise disinterested in offering an extensive apology simply for speaking my mind.
Feb 22 19:26:55 <hellokittycat>	I hate having to do that. He said that because he get more satisfaction out of me losing my cool than he does out of discussing actually on topic subjects.
Feb 22 19:27:35 <korn3r>	bparker: yeah... i hear that a lot recently. samba betwin linux and win was a nightmare for me to configure in general, also network-wise samba is not very pleasant to configure (at least was quite recently)
Feb 22 19:28:06 <bparker>	I didn't have to configure _anything_
Feb 22 19:28:08 <korn3r>	network-wise means at corporate firewall
Feb 22 19:28:08 <bparker>	it just works
Feb 22 19:28:16 <hellokittycat>	If you could somehow retroactively go back and channel what you just said korn3r into what I said, that'd be real cool, LOL
Feb 22 19:28:17 <korn3r>	good for you then
Feb 22 19:28:39 <rocks>	There are a handful of well-known ports you need to allow to make Windows/SMB stuff work, but it's not mysterious if you read the docs
Feb 22 19:29:05 <korn3r>	handful is more than 1 and netbios over the internet or whatever else it need there is "nice"
Feb 22 19:29:11 <hellokittycat>	And he said that which illustrates my point... if he had to configure less than you or vice versa, it doesn't make you or him wrong. It means the parameters led to diffferent expereinces, thus wildly disparate conclusions.
Feb 22 19:29:18 <Khaytsus>	hellokittycat: Maybe it is time to move on
Feb 22 19:29:33 <hellokittycat>	I'm going to query you
Feb 22 19:29:35 <hellokittycat>	Hold on ...
Feb 22 19:34:14 <zeratul>	do you know of another app other than gparted that can manage partition flags?
Feb 22 19:34:14 <jaojao>	Guys, does anyone know if you can access "libera" through "Dino" in Linux?
Feb 22 19:35:15 <tusko>	hellokittycat: do you have linux or gender related questions which might be topical?
Feb 22 19:35:16 <AndyCap>	zeratul: gpt or mbr partitions?
Feb 22 19:35:24 <AndyCap>	tusko: he has left.
Feb 22 19:35:30 <tusko>	oh
Feb 22 19:36:27 <AndyCap>	zeratul: at least parted I would think.
Feb 22 19:36:33 *	nullvalue hands over a tube of topical creams to tusko 
Feb 22 19:37:20 <TuxJobs>	How the hell do I make .service scripts run the same as if I run the exact same ExecStart command on the terminal?
Feb 22 19:37:39 <Bahhumbug>	"gender related questions"?  Really?
Feb 22 19:38:17 <rocks>	TuxJobs: They do, unless you're relying on some environment thing you have in your shell that is not present when systemd runs the command
Feb 22 19:38:32 <rocks>	so details are important
Feb 22 19:39:41 <TuxJobs>	rocks: The same command in the .service ExecStart opens an XTerm window in the XTerm taskbar group, but opens an XTerm window in the "MyCustomApp" taskbar group if I run it on the terminal. Exact same command.
Feb 22 19:39:54 <TuxJobs>	rocks: So clearly the GUI is ready.
Feb 22 19:39:57 <tusko>	Bahhumbug: maybe you can help me with linux
Feb 22 19:40:04 <tusko>	pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring is failing and I can't update because PGP sigs are all coming back bad
Feb 22 19:42:37 <xx>	tusko: common problem on archlinux, have you asked in their channel?
Feb 22 19:44:01 <xx>	TuxJobs: services often run in a different context/scope than what you're seeing in your GUI, for example without access to the same /tmp or dotfiles, so check the service definition and add whatever needs to be permitted
Feb 22 19:44:09 <xx>	but I'd really rethink what you're trying to do
Feb 22 19:44:21 <tusko>	xx: this may shock, surprise, and amaze you but I'm banned there :(
Feb 22 19:44:39 <tusko>	People don't understand tusko, or maybe tusko doesn't understand people
Feb 22 19:45:10 <tusko>	I tried pacman-key --refresh-key which seems to be doing something positive
Feb 22 19:45:55 <xx>	if `pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring` is failing (you haven't provided the output), then a bigger hammer is needed
Feb 22 19:46:27 <AndyCap>	go back to bootstraping the keyring if all else fails? https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Package_signing
Feb 22 19:46:52 <tusko>	xx: looks like pacman -Sy --needed archlinux-keyring && pacman -Su might have done the trick. so many commands. happy to provide output
Feb 22 19:47:18 <xx>	if it works, then don't worry
Feb 22 19:47:31 <xx>	remember, you must update archlinux every 5 minutes or the keyrings get out of date
Feb 22 19:47:44 <xx>	get an eggtimer
Feb 22 19:48:25 <tusko>	archlinux punishes us when we neglect it, as is good and proper
Feb 22 19:48:48 <Bahhumbug>	tusko: I don't run arch and have no knowledge of it other than wiki.archlinux.org being one of the best resources around no matter the distro being ran.
Feb 22 19:49:01 <katia>	this is your reminder to run yay
Feb 22 19:49:58 <tusko>	Bahhumbug: sorry I saw you lurking in there so I assumed your distro. I apologize.
Feb 22 19:50:39 <tusko>	I would ask in #archlinux but they got no love for me right now
Feb 22 19:51:33 <tusko>	wow, I just saw a key come across that expires in 2064. dude must plan to live forever
Feb 22 19:52:01 <xx>	that doesn't look right
Feb 22 19:52:25 <xx>	arch keyring shouldn't accept keys with such long expiration date, but I might be wrong
Feb 22 19:52:51 <tusko>	xx: https://bpa.st/YEOCM
Feb 22 19:53:07 <tusko>	the xx great band too btw :)
Feb 22 19:53:13 <Bahhumbug>	tusko: I am, as part of the cloak, sitting in a lot of channels that I normally would not be present in; apologies if my presence there or elsewhere may lead to the impression I am active in those communities.
Feb 22 19:55:30 <TuxJobs>	xx: "check the service definition and add whatever needs to be permitted" <-- ?
Feb 22 19:55:39 <TuxJobs>	xx: What needs to be added?
Feb 22 19:56:20 <TuxJobs>	Also, Plasma has apparently stopped updating the icons now even when you force it. Lovely. Even things that work one day don't the next...
Feb 22 19:59:11 <xx>	TuxJobs: it would help if you could paste the service file
Feb 22 19:59:56 <xx>	alternatively, stop the service, start following the journal log, start the service, look for some errors like file not found
Feb 22 20:14:57 <bparker>	TuxJobs: get ready for a whole new world of bugs as Plasma 6 is about to be released on Wednesday
Feb 22 20:18:22 <Sparkles>	Not sure what bugs you have, but years and I had like 2 bugs which are now fixed, and even when I was customizing it too much I did not like the result even. It feels stable and awesome to me.
Feb 22 20:19:42 <ssm_>	Is kde abandoning x11 any time soon? asking for my brother who has a novideo gpu so he can't use wayland (according to him)
Feb 22 20:20:11 <Khaytsus>	ssm_: afaik nouveau and nvidia both work on Wayland
Feb 22 20:20:23 <ssm_>	yeah I thought so too, I think he's working on old information
Feb 22 20:21:37 <uwharrie>	may be thinking of wlroots
Feb 22 20:24:25 <ursa>	Hi. How can I get information on a filename? I have a very strange filename that appears to not be pure unicode but instead uses character combining.
Feb 22 20:24:51 <uwharrie>	what kind of information are you looking for?
Feb 22 20:25:09 <ursa>	something that would help me make sense of it
Feb 22 20:25:20 <ssm_>	ursa: the file command may be of use, but if it's just random garbage it'll probably return data
Feb 22 20:26:11 <ssm_>	if it's a media file throw ffprobe at it
Feb 22 20:26:35 <JanC>	they said file*name*
Feb 22 20:26:57 <ssm_>	ah, misread
Feb 22 20:27:14 <ursa>	"printf '%s\n' *" shows áí.pdf
Feb 22 20:27:23 <ursa>	but if I try to cp, I need to do "cp a<0301>i<0301>.pdf something.pdf"
Feb 22 20:27:28 <TuxJobs>	bparker: I won't be subjected to the Plasma 6 madness for a long time since I use Debian. But it's hard to imagine that they could fuck things up worse than they are currently, assuming that it's not all related to the NVIDIA hardware.
Feb 22 20:27:37 <Khaytsus>	Watch the language TuxJobs
Feb 22 20:28:15 <ursa>	"printf '%s\n' * | hd" shows: 00000000  61 cc 81 69 cc 81 2e 70  64 66 0a                 |a..i...pdf.|
Feb 22 20:28:30 <ursa>	I need a way of detecting such strange filenames
Feb 22 20:28:40 <ursa>	so that I can then rename them to proper unicode
Feb 22 20:28:47 <Khaytsus>	Maybe they're double byte?
Feb 22 20:29:16 <uwharrie>	what's not proper about the existing name?
Feb 22 20:29:18 <twainwek>	is there any cheaper option than rpi5 (comparable hw)?
Feb 22 20:29:37 <ssm_>	ursa: vis tells me a\M-L\M^Ai\M-L\M^A.pdf
Feb 22 20:30:29 <ssm_>	I did ls *.pdf | vis
Feb 22 20:30:33 <Armand>	twainwek: You might want to be topic-specific.... #hardware
Feb 22 20:30:34 <ursa>	the proper byte sequence should be c3 a1 c3 ad 2e 70 64 66  0a
Feb 22 20:30:58 <uwharrie>	they're functionally equivalent, one isn't more proper than the other
Feb 22 20:31:01 <ursa>	áí.pdf vs áí.pdf maybe it will show up on IRC
Feb 22 20:31:28 <ursa>	uwharrie: The problem is that I have both áí.pdf and áí.pdf in the same directory and that is a mess
Feb 22 20:31:49 <ssm_>	for i in *.pdf; do vis $i; done
Feb 22 20:31:58 <uwharrie>	ah, yeah, that'd be annoying
Feb 22 20:31:58 <ursa>	ssm_: which package contains vis?
Feb 22 20:32:05 <uwharrie>	vis is a BSD thing
Feb 22 20:32:14 <ssm_>	cat -v should serve a similar purpose (sorry plan9)
Feb 22 20:32:32 <Khaytsus>	Fedora has a 'vis' package, dunno if other distros package it
Feb 22 20:32:43 <uwharrie>	vis won't solve this problem
Feb 22 20:33:16 <ursa>	echo a<0301>i<0301>.pdf| cat -v gives aM-LM-^AiM-LM-^A.pdf
Feb 22 20:33:24 <ursa>	echo áí.pdf| cat -v gives M-CM-!M-CM--.pdf

Feb 22 20:35:50 <ursa>	https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/unicode-normalization might be related I just found it
Feb 22 20:36:08 <ursa>	Normalization can be what is at play here
Feb 22 20:36:32 <ssm_>	something like find / -type f -name '*áí*'
Feb 22 20:36:41 <uwharrie>	Perl can detect the difference between the characters, and the Unicode::Normalize module can switch between forms
Feb 22 20:37:03 <AndyCap>	ursa: also https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/
Feb 22 20:37:35 <ursa>	What is the expected normalization on linux? So that I know what to convert them to
Feb 22 20:37:43 <uwharrie>	there isn't one
Feb 22 20:37:44 <AndyCap>	ursa: this is just going from memory, but I seem to recall OSX leaning towards the combiners.
Feb 22 20:37:59 <JanC>	there also exists a 'unicode' command that can be useful to understand such strings
Feb 22 20:38:25 <Sparkles>	ssm_, why would the community abandom a tech more than 10% of userbase use?: https://www.phoronix.com/news/Firefox-Wayland-X11-Stats
Feb 22 20:38:36 <ursa>	JanC: Do you know which package has that command?
Feb 22 20:38:38 <uwharrie>	the system can handle either, it's up to the software producing the filename to decide which it uses
Feb 22 20:38:41 <JanC>	package 'unicode' in Debian/Ubuntu
Feb 22 20:38:43 <Sparkles>	More than 90%*
Feb 22 20:39:11 <AndyCap>	even though some software might have issues with some types of normalization https://forum.syncthing.net/t/symbols-non-english-alphabets-in-filenames/1498
Feb 22 20:39:18 <ursa>	uwharrie: in my case, the system handles these filenames badly, so I need to find out which normalization is in use currently, and then convert it to the other one
Feb 22 20:39:19 <JanC>	it will explain all the code points in the string you give it
Feb 22 20:39:36 <uwharrie>	ursa: there isn't one "in use currently"
Feb 22 20:40:02 <uwharrie>	different applications are free to name files which ever way they prefer
Feb 22 20:40:38 <uwharrie>	to the OS, they're just sequences of bytes, it's not doing any (de)composition or normalization on its own
Feb 22 20:40:50 <JanC>	some filesystems have an option to normalise filenames & only allow UTF-8...
Feb 22 20:41:07 <uwharrie>	both filename are valid UTF-8
Feb 22 20:41:14 <AndyCap>	once upon a time while moving from 8-bit character encoding to unicode I used convmv but I dunno if they kept on developing it to also do unicode normalization

Feb 22 21:16:32 <uwharrie>	hmm, the version I used did "Enca reads given text files, or standard input when none are given" but it's been a while
Feb 22 21:17:28 <ursa>	I'll test again then

Feb 22 21:20:20 <AndyCap>	Thuryn: and what does klist say if the user does ssh -K windowsmahcine  ?
Feb 22 21:22:10 <ursa>	"For maximal pleasure, run unicode on UTF-8 capable terminal" from the man.1 unicode
Feb 22 21:22:47 <ursa>	that tool helped me find the difference between á and á but it only manages to deal with a single character
Feb 22 21:26:08 <ursa>	user error, my terminal was broken, it works on multiple characters too
Feb 22 21:53:57 <ursa>	"convmv -r -f utf8 -t utf8 --nfc $HOME" does what I need, at least partially. It found a lot of strange filenames that I am now working through.

Feb 23 01:05:06 <Larotin>	Hello!
Feb 23 01:05:35 <Larotin>	I'm having an issue with a linux game...
Feb 23 01:05:35 <kurahaupo>	Larotin: welcome. Which Linux distro do you run?
Feb 23 01:05:51 <VecT0r_X>	hi
Feb 23 01:06:05 <Larotin>	kurahaupo: Debian testing
Feb 23 01:06:51 <Larotin>	thextech's SMBX (AKA Opensource 2D mario) won't utilise libjpeg for some reason
Feb 23 01:07:00 <Larotin>	on debian
Feb 23 01:07:53 <Larotin>	libjpeg.so.8 is not avaliable on any package...
Feb 23 01:08:23 <rbox>	won't utilize? the nerve!
Feb 23 01:08:27 <kurahaupo>	Larotin: I'm not familiar with the particular package, but a common problem is mismatched version numbers and/or version symbols
Feb 23 01:08:48 <eu^174-17-165-12>	versions are hot
Feb 23 01:08:53 <Namarrgon>	which version of libjpeg.so do you have installed?
Feb 23 01:09:02 <Larotin>	libjpeg62-turbo
Feb 23 01:09:13 <kurahaupo>	Lemme guess, sid only has  libjpeg.so.9  ?
Feb 23 01:09:22 <Larotin>	the game doen't use that
Feb 23 01:09:39 <Larotin>	hurahaupo: I guess??
Feb 23 01:09:42 <kurahaupo>	When was the game compiled?
Feb 23 01:09:53 <Larotin>	lemme check
Feb 23 01:10:21 <kurahaupo>	Larotin: you might need to compile the library yourself.
Feb 23 01:10:31 <Larotin>	...
Feb 23 01:11:57 <Larotin>	The latest update of the game was released about 2 weeks ago.
Feb 23 01:12:23 <Larotin>	kurahaupo: where's the repo of the library?
Feb 23 01:12:35 <kurahaupo>	(it's not hard: git clone {repo} libjpeg && cd libjpeg ; ./configure && make && sudo make install)
Feb 23 01:13:22 <kurahaupo>	Ah, the repo? Dunno. You can probably find it faster than me.
Feb 23 01:14:35 <Namarrgon>	is there no libjpeg8 package in the repos of testing?
Feb 23 01:15:36 <kurahaupo>	I guess we can assume it was compiled between 3 & 6 weeks ago, using libraries that were snapshot(ted?) at the beginning of their QA stream.
Feb 23 01:15:44 <phinxy>	Hey, what's the difference between splud and a sewing machine?
Feb 23 01:15:44 <Larotin>	$(sudo apt-file search libjpeg.so.8) gives nothing
Feb 23 01:15:51 <phinxy>	Well, when you press the pedal on a sewing machine, it doesn't give you datasheets – just stitches!
Feb 23 01:16:07 <Armand>	You don't know how to use a sewing machine...... :P
Feb 23 01:16:34 <phinxy>	Im a failure
Feb 23 01:16:51 <Armand>	oof
Feb 23 01:16:56 <Armand>	Right in the feels, man
Feb 23 01:17:54 <Larotin>	g++ is like 60mb but whatever
Feb 23 01:18:07 <Armand>	Only 60MB ?
Feb 23 01:18:49 <rbox>	SIXTY MEGABYTES!?
Feb 23 01:19:08 <Armand>	OVER NINE THOUSAND?!?
Feb 23 01:21:08 <Larotin>	guys,make gave me this error... https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/4d4252012f62
Feb 23 01:21:26 <rbox>	sounds like autoheader isn't installed
Feb 23 01:21:53 <Larotin>	what is autoheader?
Feb 23 01:22:12 <Namarrgon>	do you have "build-essential" installed?
Feb 23 01:22:18 <Larotin>	uhhhhhhhhhhh
Feb 23 01:22:18 <rbox>	Larotin: a program
Feb 23 01:23:48 <jeffreymichael>	install it backwardz
Feb 23 01:23:58 <Larotin>	I install build-essential and it gave me the same error
Feb 23 01:24:32 <rbox>	OH NO! the same error!
Feb 23 01:24:39 <jim>	Larotin, what err?
Feb 23 01:24:56 <Larotin>	jim: https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/4d4252012f62
Feb 23 01:26:03 <Larotin>	oh, it's the autoconf package
Feb 23 01:26:22 <jim>	good chance
Feb 23 01:32:57 <Larotin>	The compiled (https://github.com/thorfdbg/libjpeg) fixed nothing... same error
Feb 23 01:34:55 <Namarrgon>	you just manually installed it into /usr/lib skipping the package manager?
Feb 23 01:36:37 <Larotin>	yesn't, I $(sudo make install)-ed it
Feb 23 01:37:01 <jeffreymichael>	yeah guys are computer headz
Feb 23 01:37:25 <ski>	(`/usr/lib' or `/usr/local/lib' ?)
Feb 23 01:38:49 <eu^174-17-165-12>	sudo apt update
Feb 23 01:39:21 <Larotin>	All packages are up to date.
Feb 23 01:39:21 <eu^174-17-165-12>	sudo apt install jjpeg*
Feb 23 01:39:59 <Namarrgon>	it would have been wiser to preload the library instead of polluting /usr
Feb 23 01:40:08 <Namarrgon>	or rebuild the game instead of the library
Feb 23 01:40:38 <Larotin>	Do I REALLY need to rebuild the ga,m?
Feb 23 01:41:18 <Sparkles>	ski, may I ask for what kind of software?
Feb 23 01:41:52 <Namarrgon>	Larotin: if you still get the same error you did something wrong with the library
Feb 23 01:42:14 <rocks>	The lazy way to fix this if the ABI didn't change too much is just to make a symlink to the new library with the old name
Feb 23 01:42:16 <phogg>	I hope you didn't literally run  $(sudo make install)
Feb 23 01:42:40 *	rocks wonders why we're using command substitution syntax for commands today
Feb 23 01:42:58 <Namarrgon>	rocks: that's bad advice, second only to "sudo make install"ing it into /usr
Feb 23 01:43:12 <rocks>	When it works, it works. When it doesn't, you fix it properly
Feb 23 01:43:29 <Larotin>	Namarrrgon: no, the "source code" compiled jpeg, not the library (I guess)
Feb 23 01:43:45 <ski>	Sparkles : huh ?
Feb 23 01:44:12 <Larotin>	phogg: yes, kurahaupo told me to do so, I guess that,s the way to install it.
Feb 23 01:44:12 <Sparkles>	ski, I thought you asked a question deciding a proper location for the lib.
Feb 23 01:44:42 <ski>	Sparkles : no, asking Namarrgon where they installed the manually compiled library
Feb 23 01:45:11 <Namarrgon>	ski: you have to ask Larotin
Feb 23 01:45:27 <ski>	er .. sorry, yea, i meant Larotin
Feb 23 01:45:30 <phogg>	Larotin: everything except the $( and the ) would be correct.
Feb 23 01:46:05 <Larotin>	phogg: yeah, I ran the command inside the $()
Feb 23 01:46:19 <phogg>	Larotin: that is certainly incorrect, and possibly harmful
Feb 23 01:47:01 <phogg>	Larotin: compare: 'echo foo bar' to '$(echo foo bar)' to see what I mean
Feb 23 01:47:12 <phogg>	Larotin: where did you get the game that isn't working?
Feb 23 01:47:31 <Sparkles>	Oh. I see. Apologies. I would say that `/usr` is vendor packages for all users on the machine but read-only. `/usr/local`, still read-only but for machine machine only, hence local or for something manualy compiled by the sys-admin specifically for this environment like custom software, scripts, etc.
Feb 23 01:47:32 <espresso>	Larotin: 'I ran the commanad inside the $()' could be interpreted in both ways xD
Feb 23 01:47:38 <rocks>	$(echo $(echo $(echo echo hello)))
Feb 23 01:48:07 <Larotin>	phogg: https://wohlsoft.ru/projects/TheXTech/#links
Feb 23 01:48:24 <phogg>	Larotin: so you built it from source yourself?
Feb 23 01:48:34 <Sparkles>	I had somewhere a nice addition to `man file-hierarchy`. Found it: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/4194/133353
Feb 23 01:49:07 <rocks>	To be fair, it's not uncommon in chat to use `` to delimit a command that should be run, but I've never seen anyone use $(), and I always assumed people knew to take the `` off
Feb 23 01:49:40 <rocks>	Bold to be running pre-compiled binaries from .ru sites
Feb 23 01:50:43 <Larotin>	rocks: It's also on github: https://github.com/TheXTech/TheXTech/releases/tag/v1.3.6.4
Feb 23 01:50:44 <Sparkles>	I use `` in chats due to Markdown. It's a habbit.
Feb 23 01:51:33 <Sparkles>	I usually don't assume shell when topic/subject is not shell oriented. If we would talk about shell, `` and '' would be more explicit.
Feb 23 01:51:39 <Larotin>	the writing doesn't really matter, I used it to resemble the command line on a text-only chat like this
Feb 23 01:52:27 <Larotin>	phogg: I ran the command INSIDE and not the $(command) itselft
Feb 23 01:53:32 <Larotin>	can someone help me compile this: http://www.ijg.org/files/
Feb 23 01:53:50 <Larotin>	it doesn't have makefile
Feb 23 01:54:03 <Larotin>	i need the 8 version
Feb 23 01:55:42 <ski>	rocks : fwiw, i use `blah'
Feb 23 01:55:43 <Namarrgon>	extract the tarball, build the makefile
Feb 23 01:56:10 <rocks>	Typewriter quotes
Feb 23 01:56:16 <rocks>	The worst of both worlds
Feb 23 01:56:22 <phogg>	Larotin: that's why I asked about *literally* running whole thing. If you only ran part of it then that's different.
Feb 23 01:56:42 <rascul>	./configure && make && make install
Feb 23 01:56:48 <Larotin>	phogg: ok
Feb 23 01:57:26 <Namarrgon>	i wouldn't even install it, LD_PRELOAD first and see if it works at all
Feb 23 01:57:58 *	rocks offers an LD_LIBRARY_PATH as a more flexible option
Feb 23 01:58:29 <Larotin>	rascul: it doesn't have such file, only a install-sh
Feb 23 01:58:44 <rascul>	it has a configure which will create the Makefile
Feb 23 01:59:19 <rascul>	i grabbed the latest source tarball
Feb 23 01:59:59 <ski>	they specifically do not want the latest version, i thought ?
Feb 23 02:00:22 <rascul>	i dunno
Feb 23 02:00:40 <Namarrgon>	nothing changed in the build process between the latest and 8
Feb 23 02:00:50 <phogg>	I am unclear on what the problem is, but willing to play along at home
Feb 23 02:00:59 *	phogg is building this thing now to see if there is a libjpeg problem
Feb 23 02:01:09 <ski>	the game wanted an earlier version than what's provided by the distro
Feb 23 02:01:39 <Larotin>	yeah I needed to install the jpegsrc file
Feb 23 02:01:51 <Larotin>	not jpeg
Feb 23 02:02:05 <phogg>	ski: surprising, since Debian typically ships several versions of libjpeg
Feb 23 02:02:14 <rascul>	8d is the same, ./configure && make && make install
Feb 23 02:02:26 <rascul>	umm, add ldconfig to that also
Feb 23 02:03:57 <phogg>	ldconfig to taste
Feb 23 02:04:33 <rocks>	People usually only jump through these hoops when the source code for something has been lost and there's nothing but an ancient binary that links old things
Feb 23 02:04:35 <phogg>	looks like debian testing has libjpeg62-turbo
Feb 23 02:05:31 <phogg>	so it's neither libjpeg8 nor libjpeg9
Feb 23 02:06:40 <phogg>	I am unclear on the relationship between libturbojpeg, libjpegturbo, and libjpeg (if any)
Feb 23 02:06:56 <phogg>	but there appear to be two distinct versioning schemes here
Feb 23 02:07:23 <CyberFunk>	hello
Feb 23 02:07:51 <phogg>	looks like libjpeg9 is in sid, but no version in testing? Weird.
Feb 23 02:08:15 <Larotin>	Can anyone report this so nobody else has to compile it?
Feb 23 02:08:23 <phogg>	Larotin: report what?
Feb 23 02:08:39 <Larotin>	phogg: the missing package(s)
Feb 23 02:09:03 <phogg>	Larotin: I don't see anything missing
Feb 23 02:09:22 <Larotin>	phogg: libjpeg 8 and 9
Feb 23 02:09:39 <phogg>	Larotin: they're not missing, they're just not in testing
Feb 23 02:10:08 <Larotin>	phogg: and why, they should be in there
Feb 23 02:10:20 <uwharrie>	maybe they've switched to a different implementation
Feb 23 02:10:21 <Namarrgon>	for a game that isn't in the repos either?
Feb 23 02:10:57 <rocks>	The build instructions on Github for Debian specify libjpeg-dev, which depends on libjpeg62-turbo-dev and conflicts with later versions
Feb 23 02:11:05 <phogg>	I don't have a debian testing box handy to play with, but on my pretty-recent devuan system I can get the source and build OK with the libjpeg I have, which is close in version to debian testing
Feb 23 02:11:06 <Larotin>	Namarrgon: the packages are on ubuntu, so yeah
Feb 23 02:12:11 <Larotin>	I compiled ad install libjpeg8 and 8d and the error persists
Feb 23 02:12:15 <phogg>	Larotin: ubuntu is not debian. What is true for one may not be true for the other.
Feb 23 02:12:18 <phogg>	Larotin: what error?
Feb 23 02:12:29 <Larotin>	thextech-smbx: error while loading shared libraries: libjpeg.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Feb 23 02:13:09 <Namarrgon>	do you have a libjpeg.so.8 now? where is it installed to?
Feb 23 02:13:09 <rascul>	did you run ldconfig?
Feb 23 02:13:16 <ski>	`ldconfig' ?
Feb 23 02:14:04 <Larotin>	rascul: ski: THANKS
Feb 23 02:14:16 <Larotin>	IT WORKS
Feb 23 02:14:23 <phogg>	Larotin: works for me without a custom libjpeg build.
Feb 23 02:14:40 <Larotin>	phogg: wat, how
Feb 23 02:15:34 <phogg>	Larotin: my distro is different, but I have libjpeg62-turbo installed. A version of that package is available for Debian testing.
Feb 23 02:16:13 <Larotin>	phogg: I have this installed by default
Feb 23 02:16:18 <phogg>	the testing version is 1:2.1.5-2+b2 and mine is 1:2.1.5-2 so I imagine it should work
Feb 23 02:16:50 <phogg>	Larotin: you have the libjpeg-dev package installed as well, right?
Feb 23 02:17:00 <Larotin>	phogg:no?
Feb 23 02:17:18 <phogg>	you will want that, and maybe libjpeg62-turbo-dev as well. I have both
Feb 23 02:17:30 <zeratul>	please tell me how to add a folder to PATH
Feb 23 02:17:35 <phogg>	Larotin: remember: if you are compiling something and it needs some lib, it *also* needs that lib's -dev package.
Feb 23 02:17:37 <rocks>	libjpeg-dev is a metapackage
Feb 23 02:18:02 <phogg>	zeratul: PATH="$PATH:/new/path" # to add at the end, so it is checked last (safest)
Feb 23 02:18:21 <Larotin>	phogg: yeah, but I'm not compiling it
Feb 23 02:18:23 <phogg>	zeratul: if you want it checked first it's PATH=/new/path:$PATH
Feb 23 02:18:33 <phogg>	Larotin: you are compiling TheXTech
Feb 23 02:18:37 <Larotin>	phogg: I just want to run a game.
Feb 23 02:18:46 <Larotin>	phogg: no......
Feb 23 02:19:10 <phogg>	Larotin: when I asked you where you got the game you were trying you linked me to a git repo. Therefore I assume you are compiling it.
Feb 23 02:19:59 <phogg>	Larotin: did you mean to link me to a specific binary release URL?
Feb 23 02:20:45 <Larotin>	phogg: I linked the releases page, and rocks told me when I lined the .ru link "Bold to be running pre-compiled binaries from .ru sites"
Feb 23 02:21:50 <phogg>	Larotin: you are correct, my mistake
Feb 23 02:22:10 <phogg>	Larotin: let me try the release version you linked instead. But, FWIW, compiling was easy and it starts up fine after that.
Feb 23 02:22:40 <Larotin>	Anyway, Issue fix, but the problem isn't, someone oughtta report this bug!
Feb 23 02:22:46 <phogg>	Larotin: which binary download did you get? I see a .deb as well as some generic amd64 linux options
Feb 23 02:22:48 <Larotin>	*fixed
Feb 23 02:23:01 <phogg>	Larotin: I'll report a bug if I can find one. So far I see nothing wrong.
Feb 23 02:23:33 <Larotin>	phogg: I Installed the deb for Ubuntu 20 (U20) and tested the other deb releases
Feb 23 02:23:46 <jeffreymichael>	fuck it  it man..plug tha shit in..muithafuckaz
Feb 23 02:23:46 <phogg>	Larotin: well there's your problem right there
Feb 23 02:24:04 <phogg>	when people say that Ubuntu packages are not necessarily going to work on Debian this is exactly what they mean
Feb 23 02:24:40 <phogg>	Larotin: since you have already obtained, compiled, and installed a libjpeg8 that works I think we're done here. There is nothing wrong.
Feb 23 02:24:42 <Khaytsus>	jeffreymichael: chill on the language
Feb 23 02:24:52 <jeffreymichael>	alright dawg
Feb 23 02:25:21 <Larotin>	phogg: I don't know, I tried other deb releases from other projects and it worked, there's gdebi for resolving deps but it doesn't always work (I guess?)
Feb 23 02:25:28 <jeffreymichael>	plug it
Feb 23 02:25:49 <phogg>	Larotin: a .deb intended for Ubuntu *might* happen to work on Debian, but there are no guarantees. Some things about the two distros are different. You found one of those differences.
Feb 23 02:25:56 <jeffreymichael>	never let it get you down
Feb 23 02:26:33 <Larotin>	phogg: oh
Feb 23 02:26:54 <phogg>	but, FYI, if you had gone to https://github.com/TheXTech/TheXTech/wiki/Building-on-Linux-or-xBSD and followed the Debian/Ubuntu instructions to compile it yourself you would likely have had a smooth experience, as I did.
Feb 23 02:26:56 <zeratul>	phogg, thanks
Feb 23 02:27:22 <Larotin>	phogg: So this isn't a bug, it,s a dependency issue between debian and ubuntu...
Feb 23 02:27:42 <phogg>	Larotin: say rather a difference in packaging between the two
Feb 23 02:27:47 <jeffreymichael>	ubuntu is wierd
Feb 23 02:27:55 <Larotin>	Imagine someone compiling a mario game to play it...
Feb 23 02:28:49 <phogg>	Larotin: on Debian to get libjpeg itself you have to go outside of the main repo. If you had added sid you could have installed a version of libjpeg that would probably work. Not a great option, but a simple-sid-backport would have done what you need
Feb 23 02:29:32 <phogg>	Larotin: you say that like it's hard. I did it in 10 minutes while doing three other things, and I stopped to write a makefile just so I wouldn't have to remember the build steps if I ever want to do it again later on
Feb 23 02:29:51 <Larotin>	phogg: Great, I wish someone told me that earlier
Feb 23 02:30:21 <phogg>	Larotin: in the end the amount of effort for compiling the program itself or libjpeg is probably about the same for you.
Feb 23 02:30:37 <Larotin>	yeah
Feb 23 02:31:45 <Larotin>	phogg: wait, since the package exist on debian sid and not testing (dispute being old) it's technically a bug, right?
Feb 23 02:32:04 <phogg>	Larotin: FYI if you '/join #debian' then '/msg dpkg simple sid backport' it will give you the steps to create a backport of something like libjpeg9 that is in sid but not testing/stable
Feb 23 02:32:09 <zeratul>	phogg, do you know how to make it permanent?
Feb 23 02:32:35 <phogg>	Larotin: it's not a bug if it isn't intended to exist. Many packages languish in sid and they may never make it to stable
Feb 23 02:32:43 <phogg>	zeratul: put it in your shell rc
Feb 23 02:33:09 <phogg>	zeratul: e.g. ~/.profile (or possibly ~/.bashrc, or ~/.zshrc, or similar depending on what you're doing)
Feb 23 02:33:19 <Larotin>	phogg: oh, yeah, makes sense.
Feb 23 02:34:18 <phogg>	Larotin: I know some older Debian releases had both libjpeg-turbo and libjpeg in stable, so it seems like one of them fell out. Maybe the maintainer just wasn't responsive enough to keep up with release cricitcal bugs? You could look at the package bug tracker and find out.
Feb 23 02:34:41 <jeffreymichael>	nuthin whatsup
Feb 23 02:34:51 <jeffreymichael>	me too
Feb 23 02:34:56 <zeratul>	phogg, ok but do you know where the other PATH settings are stored?
Feb 23 02:35:03 <jeffreymichael>	wisconsin
Feb 23 02:35:20 <phogg>	zeratul: there is no simple answer to that
Feb 23 02:35:52 <phogg>	zeratul: PATH is inherited from the environment of the parent process. Depending on your distribution it may ultimately be set in many ways by many things, and very probably is constructed bit by bit.
Feb 23 02:36:13 <zeratul>	oh I see
Feb 23 02:36:29 <phogg>	zeratul: that said, you can *probably* find some initial value for it somewhere in /etc/profile, /etc/profile.d/, /etc/bashrc, /etc/bash.bashrc, /etc/bash/, or /etc/environment
Feb 23 02:36:57 <jeffreymichael>	rip tha stuff
Feb 23 02:37:11 <espresso>	zeratul: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Environment_variables#Defining_variables could be interesting
Feb 23 02:37:22 <phogg>	zeratul: but if you boot to a GUI login prompt it might only be /etc/environment that applies, or it may be a display-manager-specific config file, or possibly a systemd .service that defines it
Feb 23 02:37:30 <jeffreymichael>	Weston is here
Feb 23 02:37:39 <phogg>	zeratul: this also can vary heavily depending on your distribution.
Feb 23 02:37:43 <jeffreymichael>	just kidding
Feb 23 02:37:51 <phogg>	if you specify your distro you can get more specific answers
Feb 23 02:38:01 <Larotin>	phogg: So, technically, there's a missing package on debian testing that made it to sid and stable, most likely a bug.
Feb 23 02:38:09 <jeffreymichael>	im using fedora linux
Feb 23 02:38:11 <jeffreymichael>	34
Feb 23 02:38:16 <phogg>	Larotin: no. It's not in stable either.
Feb 23 02:38:23 <Larotin>	phogg: oh
Feb 23 02:38:26 <phogg>	Larotin: the last time I recall seeing it was at least oldoldoldstable
Feb 23 02:38:51 <lockywolf>	How do I list which files a package installed in ubuntu?
Feb 23 02:39:08 <phogg>	lockywolf: dpkg -S packagename, or if you have it installed dlocate packagename
Feb 23 02:39:21 <Larotin>	phogg: So, the package is too old to be included anyone in debian or what, why it exists in ubuntu then?
Feb 23 02:39:36 <phogg>	Larotin: I can't answer that without more research
Feb 23 02:39:58 <scottpedia>	lockywolf: use dpkg i think
Feb 23 02:40:07 <scottpedia>	not exactly sure about the options
Feb 23 02:40:09 <phogg>	Larotin: wild speculation: maybe the Ubuntu package maintainer nominated it for inclusion in stable and handled any -rc bugs, but his Debian counterparts didn't (or didn't fast enough).
Feb 23 02:40:47 <phogg>	Larotin: or, there could be a Debian policy decision which has decided that libjpeg-turbo should be the one library used by stable, and libjpeg is left in sid as a courtesy
Feb 23 02:42:10 <phogg>	lockywolf: if you want a more *direct* answer you can find a file at /var/lib/dpkg/info/${packagename}:${arch}.list that contains *just* the paths.
Feb 23 02:42:21 <Larotin>	phogg: Shouldn't they keep compatibility with old programs? (bc debian stable being one of the oldest distro with old packaging)
Feb 23 02:42:31 <lockywolf>	phogg: thank you!
Feb 23 02:42:33 <phogg>	but the :${arch} part is optional
Feb 23 02:43:03 <Larotin>	phogg: I don't see why they would drop a package that is still in use.
Feb 23 02:43:09 <jeffreymichael>	lok
Feb 23 02:43:30 <jeffreymichael>	opps
Feb 23 02:43:34 <Larotin>	phogg: maybe they should make a symlink on a metapackage
Feb 23 02:43:45 <jeffreymichael>	p0intxt3r
Feb 23 02:43:54 <phogg>	lockywolf: also also, technically you can get the same info out of dpkg-query (but I don't have it memorized). The trouble with dpkg -S and dlocate is they search both package names and file names, so you need more steps to filter it down to just match packages
Feb 23 02:44:09 <phogg>	Larotin: it's a question you should direct to the debian-users mailing list
Feb 23 02:44:24 <phogg>	Larotin: or, you could start by asking in #debian
Feb 23 02:45:14 <Larotin>	phogg: Ok I'll be doing that now, Thanks for helping me getting my favorite game running on linux, bye!
Feb 23 02:47:49 <Sparkles>	Larotin, supporting requires time and each release assumes different maintenance. Maintainers usually support the recent and a few previous stable releases, mostly LTS, and in case required something non-supported, the following is suggested isntead: https://wiki.debian.org/AptConfiguration#apt_preferences_.28APT_pinning.29 , and those who have some time and want to contribute "backport" packages:

Feb 23 03:46:04 <joshua>	first time talking to someone in IRC
Feb 23 03:46:19 <hunter0one>	welcome
Feb 23 03:46:29 <Sparkles>	joshua, hey there! Always welcome! ^^
Feb 23 03:46:41 <daydrinking>	Nice joshua. It
Feb 23 03:46:49 <daydrinking>	s a slow day
Feb 23 03:46:51 <espresso>	welcome to #linux and the enduring IRC :)
Feb 23 03:46:57 <DeepChill>	It's my first time on IRC in over 10 years
Feb 23 03:47:22 <hunter0one>	Any PCLOS users?
Feb 23 03:47:30 <DeepChill>	used to spend hours each day on mIRC in my prime lol
Feb 23 03:49:37 <daydrinking>	aw, left so soon. Hopefully he comes back
Feb 23 03:51:15 <hackinghorn>	who left?
Feb 23 03:54:25 <daydrinking>	joshua left. It looks like y'all had some fun earlier
Feb 23 03:55:45 <dave>	hello every one
Feb 23 03:56:09 <daydrinking>	Hows it going?
Feb 23 03:56:34 <dave>	first time in here
Feb 23 03:56:39 <DeepChill>	so what goes on in this server?
Feb 23 03:56:45 <dave>	doing ok
Feb 23 03:56:47 <DeepChill>	do people just greet each other or do conversations happen lol
Feb 23 03:57:14 <Khaytsus>	This isn't a social channel, it's linux support per the topic
Feb 23 03:57:15 <daydrinking>	Ideally people ask questions about linux and discuss broken SATA cables lol
Feb 23 03:58:38 <dave>	dose anyone know how to turn up the brightness in blackarch linux
Feb 23 03:59:25 <dave>	had to take it off to dark couldnt see a thing
Feb 23 04:00:03 <ssm_>	maybe if you weren't using blackarch it wouldn't be so dark. If you're on X, xbacklight -inc [percent]
Feb 23 04:00:38 <ssm_>	likewise, xbacklight -dec [percent] to decrease brightness
Feb 23 04:00:56 <ssm_>	you can all just use -set to set it to a percent brightness
Feb 23 04:01:30 <dave>	tried that never worked
Feb 23 04:01:59 <Khaytsus>	Most laptops I've used the typical function keys work
Feb 23 04:03:22 <dave>	slider moves but dosent alter the brightness just put it on to try came back to zorin
Feb 23 04:04:22 <dave>	new to linux looking at the difrent dist
Feb 23 04:05:21 <Khaytsus>	Maybe try something mainstream rather than for pen testing
Feb 23 04:06:51 <daydrinking>	There is a folder in /etc/ that contains things like power capacity, current battery, etc. One of them controls brightness. I'll look on arch forums, cause I know I had to do a custom script on one laptop to get it to work with i3. Basically though you'd have ascript run on start that can write to that file.
Feb 23 04:07:10 <Khaytsus>	You mean proc
Feb 23 04:08:03 <agent314>	aaaand i'm back
Feb 23 04:09:14 <dave>	useing a panasonic toughbook the only linux that works with sound is linux tails cant get sound to work on any other dont think they like the sound #

Feb 23 04:11:49 <dave>	dose work with head phones though
Feb 23 04:12:53 <tusko>	sure, bud
Feb 23 04:13:16 <daydrinking>	/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness is where it is on my system. But that number is based on the max_brightness as well
Feb 23 04:14:03 <dave>	thanks will make a note and try that
Feb 23 04:14:10 <espresso>	dave: https://distrowatch.com/ might be helpful
Feb 23 04:14:27 <ssm_>	dave: the first thing to know about linux distributions is that 90% of them are fake and are just a major distro with some preinstalled software. The independent linux distros I know of are alpine, void, debian, rocky (shh rhel doesn't exist), arch, gentoo, sourcemage (dead), and crux (probably dead)
Feb 23 04:14:42 <ssm_>	try one of those instead of single-user distros
Feb 23 04:15:15 <ssm_>	oh and slackware
Feb 23 04:15:21 <dave>	thank you
Feb 23 04:15:31 <daydrinking>	dave: I'll see if I can find the script I wrote. But yeah ssm_ is right, if I were you I'd take a step back from this distro if you don't have a need to use this one
Feb 23 04:15:48 <hunter0one>	pclinuxos :-)
Feb 23 04:17:08 <dave>	yes was just looking to find one so i can ditch windows
Feb 23 04:17:43 <dave>	thanks for the help
Feb 23 04:18:14 <daydrinking>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Backlight is exactly what you need if you want to stick with Blackarch for now, but otherwise - find a different distro

Feb 23 04:26:03 <daydrinking>	NeXeN: I'm using vanilla ubuntu, but studio was good the little bit I used. I think it just had a little too much for me, I think I selected all the things to install. But one of my partitions has mint and I never really use it...
Feb 23 04:26:29 <jensen>	kernel options with values Y and N means exactly as 1 and 0 and are interchangeable?
Feb 23 04:28:11 <Rock_Kickass>	Y and N mean Y and N
Feb 23 04:28:19 <dave>	have it downloading now
Feb 23 04:29:38 <NeXeN>	daydrinking: well it's based on kubuntu, which is also nice....but studio has a few things to get your config right with pipewire and stuff

Feb 23 05:47:56 <sphertext_>	OOOooooh... github has restored no-javascript functionality in their front end
Feb 23 05:48:13 <sphertext_>	impressive
Feb 23 05:48:49 <sphertext_>	i am overwhelmed with gratitude
Feb 23 05:51:08 <DeepChill>	:sphertext_what's the advantage of that?
Feb 23 05:51:40 <sphertext_>	DeepChill i can browse repos with cli programs like w3m
Feb 23 05:52:30 <ayecee>	the front end now works for browsers without javascript functionality
Feb 23 05:52:43 <sphertext_>	and more importantly, it enables modularity
Feb 23 05:52:57 <ayecee>	weird take but okay
Feb 23 05:52:58 <louipc>	wow
Feb 23 05:53:10 <sphertext_>	that react/angular javascript bullshit that loads content dynamically is designed to hold you captive in the browser window
Feb 23 05:53:18 <louipc>	modularity?
Feb 23 05:53:52 <DeepChill>	Oh wow, I was having trouble reading code off Github.com with a browser extension I made. Because of the dynamic front-end. I'm assuming this solves that?
Feb 23 05:54:14 <sphertext_>	yes, the web was invented in order to deliver documents. documents have text content. text content enables modularity with other programs that can take text input
Feb 23 05:54:19 <ayecee>	only one way to find out
Feb 23 05:54:32 <louipc>	oh i think you meant interoperability
Feb 23 05:54:53 <sphertext_>	nowadays the web no longer delivers documents. it delivers apps, that hold you captive in the browser window, where the content is being loaded dynamically
Feb 23 05:55:03 <ayecee>	doesn't fit on the buzzword bingo card
Feb 23 05:55:05 <DeepChill>	Nice. My extension connected Gemini LLM to be able to instantly translate code to different languages, generate a summary of it, etc.
Feb 23 05:55:06 <louipc>	yea thats annoying
Feb 23 05:55:13 <DeepChill>	from github.com
Feb 23 05:55:45 <louipc>	would be cool if these app websites just offered a pure data view then you can use some other app if you wished to
Feb 23 05:55:55 <louipc>	some of them have APIs
Feb 23 05:56:30 <louipc>	github has some of that which i use via CLI
Feb 23 05:57:13 <louipc>	here is one cli app https://hub.github.com/
Feb 23 05:57:29 <sphertext_>	louipc "would be cool if" yes, it would be spectacular. magnificent. overwhelmingly impressive.
Feb 23 05:57:45 <louipc>	https://cli.github.com/
Feb 23 05:57:50 <sphertext_>	but unfortunately, every effort is being spent going at the fastest possible speed in the opposite direction
Feb 23 05:57:57 <louipc>	this one seems to be official
Feb 23 05:58:26 <louipc>	i guess u could inspect these apps and develop your own as well
Feb 23 05:58:32 <sphertext_>	yeah i know about that louipc. you can't use it without logging in and you can't browse repos (including the issues forum) without cloning the whole repo locally first
Feb 23 05:59:12 <sphertext_>	although i discovered you can hack it to just download the .git folder and it will still work
Feb 23 05:59:33 <sphertext_>	also, that tool requires you to have a github accounting sign in token
Feb 23 05:59:37 <louipc>	yea its possible api access is not possible without an account
Feb 23 05:59:41 <korn3r>	chrome page hanged while i was try to open cli.github.com xD
Feb 23 05:59:45 <ShadowLabs>	anyone know how to generate a keytab for a windows account that used to mount smb shares for a media server? ntlm auth has been disabled and kerberos is the only auth mechanism. I either need to have a keytab to keep renewing or a ticket being renewed after authentication. Ive got got some folders being mounted with autofs for now.
Feb 23 06:00:41 <sphertext_>	anyway, github front end no longer requires javascript, the universe is harmonious again
Feb 23 06:01:08 <louipc>	now for the trillion other websites
Feb 23 06:01:11 <korn3r>	ShadowLabs: why exactly and what you want to renew there?
Feb 23 06:01:20 <ayecee>	ShadowLabs: no one has found out since the last time you asked.
Feb 23 06:01:31 <ayecee>	you may have to try another approach.
Feb 23 06:02:24 <ShadowLabs>	this is just a brand new account not sure on the approach from someone else.
Feb 23 06:02:55 <ayecee>	well how do other people mount shares in this scenario
Feb 23 06:04:18 <korn3r>	ill be mr.obrvious just in case: you need keytab only on server.
Feb 23 06:04:56 <ShadowLabs>	Kerberos tickets are expring and im servering media from the smb shares that should be persistent. Im currently not aware of a way to keep folders mounted after a kerberos ticket expires and would like to not have to put in a password everytime a system restarts, which is why i would need a keytab
Feb 23 06:04:57 <ayecee>	is that obvious? can't say i've ever used a keytab file.
Feb 23 06:05:13 <aiena>	Does anyonw know if a quadro A6000 can run on host and act as a vGPU in virt-manager
Feb 23 06:05:49 <ayecee>	ShadowLabs: do other people use a keytab for this scenario?
Feb 23 06:07:03 <ShadowLabs>	ayecee this is a home lab but again it sounds like the better option on not having to always putting in a password since its cached and encrypted in the keytab is which kerberos can use instead
Feb 23 06:07:29 <ayecee>	ShadowLabs: is there no other option?
Feb 23 06:09:15 <ShadowLabs>	the only other option im aware is having a credentials file located on the client system with the username and password in plaintext using a "hidden" file then putting read only perms on the file in a root directory.
Feb 23 06:09:38 <ShadowLabs>	since ntlm cant be used im not aware of any other way
Feb 23 06:10:09 <ayecee>	i don't understand why you keep bringing up ntlm. how would you do it if ntlm could be used?
Feb 23 06:10:26 <korn3r>	ShadowLabs: krb ticket should be refreshed on expiration, it doesnt do it automatically? Are we talking about clients?
Feb 23 06:11:33 <ShadowLabs>	Not that ive seen and the client is an alma linux system that uses cifs to mount smb shares from a nas system
Feb 23 06:12:20 <korn3r>	do you have " winbind refresh tickets = true" in smb.conf?
Feb 23 06:14:40 <ShadowLabs>	not using winbind
Feb 23 06:15:13 <ayecee>	would you consider using winbind if it solved your problem?
Feb 23 06:15:37 <ShadowLabs>	if winbind can use kerberos auth then i have no problem with it
Feb 23 06:16:05 <ShadowLabs>	i just cant use ntlm or ntlmssp auth
Feb 23 06:16:18 <ayecee>	still don't understand why you keep bringing that up.
Feb 23 06:17:27 <ShadowLabs>	becuase smb tries ntlm first before kerberos so im trying to minimize the the misunderstanding for the authentication
Feb 23 06:18:21 <ayecee>	you're increasing the misunderstanding here though.
Feb 23 06:18:35 <ShadowLabs>	ok sorry
Feb 23 06:18:49 <lockywolf>	How do I switch between KDE and Gnome on centos7?
Feb 23 06:21:49 <aiena>	lockywolf, not tried it yet but I think you should test in a vm installing both DEs side by side seeing if the login/display manager is conflicting. From the display manager if its not conflicting you could choose a gnome/KDE session
Feb 23 06:22:23 <aiena>	one thing you have to accept is the gnome apps and KDE apps will merge on either DEs
Feb 23 06:22:36 <birkoff>	can an emoji be hued/brightness-contrasted in a terminal ?
Feb 23 06:22:50 <ShadowLabs>	ayecee do you have a guide or info for using kerberos with smb shares?
Feb 23 06:23:04 <ayecee>	ShadowLabs: why would i
Feb 23 06:24:33 <ShadowLabs>	i dont know you were commenting on some of my questions and figured you had some answers
Feb 23 06:25:10 <korn3r>	ShadowLabs: is client joined to domain via sssd then? man says here is krb5_renew_interval in sssd.conf
Feb 23 06:25:37 <ayecee>	ShadowLabs: nope. just questions.
Feb 23 06:26:01 <ShadowLabs>	korn3r yes
Feb 23 06:27:13 <ayecee>	ShadowLabs: i'm guided by the principle that if you're trying to solve a problem one way, but can't find any info about solving it that way, that you're trying to solve it in a weird way.
Feb 23 06:27:48 <ayecee>	and it's a good time to re-evaluate, to check how others solve this problem instead.
Feb 23 06:27:55 <ShadowLabs>	fair point
Feb 23 06:28:17 <danza>	it is also cool to do some hacking, which is mostly weird
Feb 23 06:28:48 <ShadowLabs>	danza not at the cost of sanity and stabilty
Feb 23 06:28:59 <ayecee>	especially with all those animated 3d cubes amirite
Feb 23 06:29:13 <ShadowLabs>	imo
Feb 23 06:29:51 <StudioChat92>	hi
Feb 23 07:03:42 <lockywolf>	is it possible to have realtime monitoring of an sqlite database for changes?
Feb 23 07:03:59 <lockywolf>	like intercepting transations, or something like that
Feb 23 07:04:09 <lockywolf>	*transactions
Feb 23 07:05:21 <mlu>	lockywolf: wrap it
Feb 23 07:05:31 <lockywolf>	well, it's on Android
Feb 23 07:05:33 <mlu>	lockywolf: or just monitor the sqlite file?
Feb 23 07:05:44 <lockywolf>	wrap how?
Feb 23 07:05:51 <lockywolf>	intercept libsqlite calls?
Feb 23 07:06:40 <mlu>	lockywolf: more specifically, though -- what exactly are you trying to do? sounds cursed
Feb 23 07:06:59 <lockywolf>	I am trying to run-time export messages from a proprietary messenger
Feb 23 07:07:21 <lockywolf>	it is using sqlite to store them, and there exists an off-line exporter
Feb 23 07:07:48 <lockywolf>	but I don't like running it every night, I want to export the messages as they arrive (or are sent)
Feb 23 07:08:20 <mlu>	hmm, cursed
Feb 23 07:08:35 <lockywolf>	it's 2024, not 1994
Feb 23 07:08:45 <lockywolf>	and not even 2004
Feb 23 07:10:17 <lockywolf>	you know, websites rate-limiting you, search engines banning you, every website wants your passport data (and medical record), wars roaring in more and more places
Feb 23 07:11:59 <lockywolf>	I want to map every messenger to email, and liberate my phone of at least part of crap
Feb 23 07:12:36 <lockywolf>	I mean, my phone won't be liberated, but I could at least start using a decent interface
Feb 23 07:15:57 <danza>	yeah having found the database is a good starting point, but i am not aware of any change notification you can plug to an sql file ... might want to write something custom
Feb 23 07:19:46 <AndyCap>	lockywolf: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24190615/how-to-listen-for-sqlite-database-changes-in-android ?
Feb 23 07:23:07 <lockywolf>	AndyCap: interesting, thank you
Feb 23 07:29:53 <Emanuel_>	Holaa, alguna chica para platicar? (Tengo 18 años)

Feb 23 07:43:01 <Larotin>	Hi!
Feb 23 07:43:51 <Larotin>	Does anyone here know a good android modding IRC channel? I need that.
Feb 23 08:00:22 <lockywolf>	Larotin: no IRC
Feb 23 08:00:39 <lockywolf>	Larotin: but xda-developers "server" on Discord is not worthless
Feb 23 08:01:16 <karthyk>	Can I read process memory from proc fileysytem
Feb 23 08:02:24 <lockywolf>	Is it possible to use passwd backend for 389ds?
Feb 23 08:02:42 <karthyk>	389ds?
Feb 23 08:04:00 <mlu>	lockywolf: why?!
Feb 23 08:04:12 <mlu>	lockywolf: do it the other way around :)
Feb 23 08:04:26 <mlu>	karthyk: have you ever had the pleasure of 389ds? :D
Feb 23 08:04:32 <mlu>	karthyk: it slapd's
Feb 23 08:09:05 <lockywolf>	why? because I want to be able to log in if ldap goes down
Feb 23 08:09:34 <lockywolf>	like, I want to "extend" an existing setup to many machines with as little movement as possible
Feb 23 08:10:23 <lockywolf>	which, if I can make it work, would be just (1) making VMs use ldap to log in, (2) automatically create home directories
Feb 23 08:12:11 <lockywolf>	openldap does have a passwd backend
Feb 23 08:13:21 <lockywolf>	then I only have to maintain a single passwd file on the server
Feb 23 09:29:43 <nullvalue>	ben 10, where u at bro!!!
Feb 23 09:33:40 <TuxJobs>	Correction: Yesterday, I mentioned that force-updating icons in Plasma had seemingly stopped working (`kbuildsycoca5 --noincremental`), but it later turned out that the changes made to the icon were simply too small to be noticeable by the naked eye (too thin strokes) due to the heavy shrinkage from the original's 256x256 px size to 32x32 or whatever's used by Plasma down there. So I take that particular thing back; it wasn't Linux's fault that time.
Feb 23 09:42:30 <lockywolf>	sycoca is such a funny word
Feb 23 09:55:31 <Guest85>	wssap baby
Feb 23 09:55:53 <Guest85>	who here likes booty?
Feb 23 09:56:31 <oerheks>	there is no linux distro called that, Guest85
Feb 23 09:57:06 <Guest85>	u never heard of bootydist?
Feb 23 10:08:16 <lockywolf>	yeah, the Germans were making that kind of schnapps to hand out to u-boot mariners
Feb 23 10:08:27 <lockywolf>	boot-distillery
Feb 23 10:10:12 <oerheks>	Pervitine?
Feb 23 10:12:21 <xx>	no way, is that why the bootloader is called u-boot?
Feb 23 10:12:26 <TuxJobs>	Perhaps a naive thing to say, but I wish instead of systemd (and whatever Windows uses these days) we just had an "autoexec.bat" or similar file with commands that execute from top to bottom at boot and that's it.
Feb 23 10:12:44 <xx>	I always wondered what the u stands for
Feb 23 10:12:54 <xx>	TuxJobs: that's systemd though
Feb 23 10:13:14 <lockywolf>	xx: underwater
Feb 23 10:13:32 <lockywolf>	this bootloader only works below the surface of the sea
Feb 23 10:13:40 <xx>	lockywolf: I meant the u in u-boot not u-boat
Feb 23 10:13:59 <lockywolf>	TuxJobs: we, in Slackware, don't have systemd
Feb 23 10:14:08 <lockywolf>	and barely use any sysvinit features
Feb 23 10:14:23 <lockywolf>	basically one script per runlevel
Feb 23 10:15:24 <lockywolf>	systemd lost the runlevel feature
Feb 23 10:15:30 <lockywolf>	a crippled init system
Feb 23 10:16:37 <sjmulder>	our work IT admin defaults to Devuan, all the power to her! better than defaulting to enterprisey vendors like Red Hat, Canonical or MS
Feb 23 10:17:17 <sjmulder>	although we're moving to full Macs for the work laptops :(
Feb 23 10:19:12 <sjmulder>	personally I like Void which uses runit (I think?), although DIY Linux distros are daunting with the complexity of the modern Linux desktop
Feb 23 10:19:27 <TuxJobs>	runlevel feature?
Feb 23 10:26:28 <jal`>	What are the real-world practical advantages of using runit or whatever over systemd?
Feb 23 10:27:05 <aiena>	jal`, maybe less ram usage
Feb 23 10:27:22 <aiena>	more compact systems
Feb 23 10:27:43 <Disconsented>	Ego and thats about it
Feb 23 10:27:48 <jal`>	my systemd system is currently at 1.74G ram used out of 15.4G
Feb 23 10:28:28 <aiena>	1.74 gb is a lot on 4gb systems but yeah I highly doubt thats on systemd
Feb 23 10:28:48 <aiena>	i think lubuntu uses systemd nd takes a fraction
Feb 23 10:29:01 <jal`>	that's with firefox running with 10 tabs
Feb 23 10:29:24 <aiena>	jal`, I guess the reason is the same as why we have so many linux distros
Feb 23 10:29:35 <aiena>	different taste some like spicy food some like sweet food
Feb 23 10:29:54 <aiena>	debian likes apparmor RH etc like SElinux etc.
Feb 23 10:29:55 <dviola>	sjmulder: Macs for the work laptops is awful in my experience, things like docker, etc still use a VM with a linux kernel under the hood which slows things down, etc
Feb 23 10:30:04 <aiena>	now rh loves XOrg less
Feb 23 10:30:40 <sjmulder>	dviola, yeah I guess I'll be using a Linux VM most of the time. waste of resources if you ask me
Feb 23 10:30:46 <aiena>	dviola, I stay away from Macs because of cost of acquisition and repair
Feb 23 10:31:02 <sjmulder>	we were this ] [ close to issuing Framework 13 laptops
Feb 23 10:31:29 <sjmulder>	but they want to lock down the host OS, no admin etc. only for us to be admin in the VMs :shrug:
Feb 23 10:31:47 <aiena>	sjmulder, install a hpyervisor OS
Feb 23 10:31:48 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 23 10:31:49 *	litharge sets ban on $a:deepSleep$##fix_your_connection
Feb 23 10:31:57 <aiena>	and lock that down proxmox whatever
Feb 23 10:31:59 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 23 10:32:29 <aiena>	then users only get their vm space
Feb 23 10:32:43 <DeepChill>	I just removed a HDMI cable from my laptop that's running Ubuntu and it turned off. Is the era of Linux officially over?
Feb 23 10:32:49 <DeepChill>	Windows would never
Feb 23 10:33:20 <hexnewbie>	They make Linux hardware now?
Feb 23 10:33:22 <sjmulder>	DeepChill, my PC often shuts down when plugging *in* an HDMI cable, but I think something's shorting. happens regardless of OS
Feb 23 10:33:35 <sjmulder>	aiena, do you mean on a central server or on the developer laptops?
Feb 23 10:33:46 <dviola>	sjmulder: cool, there's also asahi
Feb 23 10:33:57 <aruncs>	hey anyone using obsidian
Feb 23 10:34:32 <sjmulder>	dviola, well their point is that we don't get to manage the host OS, install software on it, etc
Feb 23 10:34:44 <dviola>	aiena: I see
Feb 23 10:34:46 <sjmulder>	really complicated way of locking down Outlook if you ask me, why not run that in a VM rather than everything else
Feb 23 10:36:54 <dviola>	sjmulder: oh
Feb 23 10:37:05 <dviola>	too bad then
Feb 23 10:38:00 <steering>	DeepChill: if it is a software issue its a driver issue and windows would always ;)
Feb 23 10:39:04 <DeepChill>	unless...
Feb 23 10:44:29 <aiena>	sjmulder, I guess the central server
Feb 23 10:44:37 <aiena>	the laptops dont really matter
Feb 23 10:45:09 <aiena>	if you have a strong lan you might actually get good performance with RDP/VNC etc too form any system
Feb 23 10:45:13 <sjmulder>	aiena, the day we have to work on these RDP setups is the day I start looking for something new. it's just really annoying
Feb 23 10:45:30 <aiena>	sjmulder, RDP is annoying
Feb 23 10:45:33 <aiena>	actually all remote desktop is
Feb 23 10:45:47 <aiena>	but then there is ssh too if you dont need a GUI
Feb 23 10:49:31 <sjmulder>	reminds me of those "setting up a $1099 iPad for development by SSH-ing into a $35 Raspberry Pi" blog posts
Feb 23 10:50:09 <sjmulder>	ohh I *would* like a Framework tablet
Feb 23 10:57:09 <c_b>	I spent 5 years developing in a VM a few jobs ago, it wasn't actually that bad. We had an Ansible script to set up the VM and the dev environment on it so you could completely hose it, which wasn't uncommon, and have a fresh one in the time it took to get a coffee
Feb 23 10:59:39 <dviola>	I do all of my development in a QEMU/KVM VM (Linux VM on a Linux host), but I have the hardware resources for that and KVM is really performant, on a Mac... you are usually limited with RAM and macOS just doesn't perform as well as Linux for things like raw I/O speed, etc
Feb 23 11:00:10 <sjmulder>	once at an insurance company they had us RDP into a VM over a VPN and *then* RDP into an Azure-hosted VM
Feb 23 11:00:48 <sjmulder>	dviola, what do you use for UI? I use a lot of VMs for packaging and virt-manager is great but UI performance isn't always
Feb 23 11:06:03 <dviola>	sjmulder: I mostly deal with a single VM image in most cases, so I just launch the VM from the terminal, e.g. qemu-system-x86_64 ... -device virtio-vga-gl -display gtk,gl=on
Feb 23 11:06:24 <dviola>	I fullscreen that and put it in its own workspace
Feb 23 11:06:53 <sjmulder>	my impression is that running Qemu may be faster, not using SPICE or such
Feb 23 11:09:10 <dviola>	yeah, it is fast, sometimes I forget that I am in a actual VM, the full command that I use is here: http://0x0.st/H5OB.txt
Feb 23 11:13:22 <fweht>	i already put `%sudo   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` in my sudoers file but i still have to fill in the password every time, maybe my user is not in the sudo group?
Feb 23 11:13:32 <steering>	maybe
Feb 23 11:13:38 <steering>	`id` or `groups` will tell you
Feb 23 11:13:53 <fweht>	ah cool thanks!
Feb 23 11:14:08 <steering>	you have to log out and back in after adding yourself to a group generally btw
Feb 23 11:14:30 <fweht>	hm but im in the sudo group i think
Feb 23 11:14:35 <fweht>	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/VMxQRnc6/
Feb 23 11:14:52 <steering>	yeah you've got it there
Feb 23 11:15:43 <fweht>	but do i see in which groups i am?  or just which groups generally exist?
Feb 23 11:16:41 <fweht>	wow waybar uses more cpu than firefox (still not much but still...)
Feb 23 11:24:14 <steering>	`getent group` tells you what groups exist
Feb 23 11:24:24 <steering>	`id` and `groups` show you what groups your current session is in
Feb 23 11:24:41 <steering>	add your username to them (`id noob`) to see what groups a new session would be in
Feb 23 11:25:43 <fweht>	thanks steering
Feb 23 11:25:52 <fweht>	seems that ive been in sudo all the time
Feb 23 11:26:13 <danse-nr3>	:P
Feb 23 11:26:25 <fweht>	but still need to enter the pw
Feb 23 11:26:26 <fweht>	weird
Feb 23 11:27:22 <steering>	is there maybe another rule that applies to you that doesn't have NOPASSWD? you can check `sudo -l`
Feb 23 11:28:04 <steering>	i'm not sure if that would do it
Feb 23 11:29:23 <fweht>	ah there is `@includedir /etc/sudoers.d` in the last line!
Feb 23 11:29:39 <steering>	that is normal
Feb 23 11:29:47 <fweht>	ok
Feb 23 11:29:51 <fweht>	but nothing else
Feb 23 11:40:22 <TuxJobs>	jal`: "What are the real-world practical advantages of using runit or whatever over systemd?" <-- No idea because I've never used "runit" and systemd has basically taken over, but I've spent ridiculous amounts of time trying to decipher the inane format of systemd .service files.
Feb 23 11:40:32 <TuxJobs>	So possibly "tons of time and energy lost".
Feb 23 11:44:23 <jal`>	before systemd service files there were a bunch of error-prone shell scripts
Feb 23 11:45:47 <jal`>	back to ram, my vps with systemd and nginx is at 223M ram usage
Feb 23 11:46:12 <xiaomiao>	jal`: now we have weird unit files that call shellscripts
Feb 23 11:46:42 *	xiaomiao is usually at ~120M RAM used after boot, with X running
Feb 23 11:47:01 <joshua>	yo
Feb 23 11:47:07 <beefd00r>	Hello everyone
Feb 23 11:47:11 <joshua>	ello mate
Feb 23 11:49:43 <hexnewbie>	I think GNU/Unix needs to be cancelled. If no regex syntax is going to work, and every single tool uses a different dialect, it just doesn't need to exist.
Feb 23 11:50:14 <xx>	the command `geteltorito` is in the genisoimage package on debian, which is mostly deprecated. xorriso is generally the replacement for it. Anyone know how to get the functionality of geteltorito using xorriso or some other tool?
Feb 23 11:50:32 <hexnewbie>	I spend three hours figuring that [[ $x =~ xyz ]] can't do \s
Feb 23 11:50:35 <Sync03>	xx: that's a really specific question
Feb 23 11:50:44 <xx>	Sync03: yes
Feb 23 11:50:59 <hexnewbie>	Mind you, grep -E does \s, and [[ . =~ . ]] does other grep -E syntax (and the morons are also removing egrep to boot)
Feb 23 11:52:26 <fweht>	i use ubuntu sway remix with alternative keyboard layout (colemak) and somehow all commands related to sway tools like screenshot, launcher, etc. still use the standard qwerty keys, any idea how to fix this?
Feb 23 11:53:07 <fweht>	vscode has the same problem but `"keyboard.dispatch": "keyCode"` fixes it
Feb 23 11:53:40 <hexnewbie>	I think that's another great thing about Wayland, xkb is no more
Feb 23 11:54:36 <jal`>	fweht: I use keyd to set colemak system wide on a kernel level
Feb 23 11:54:59 <fweht>	ah cool!
Feb 23 11:55:06 <fweht>	will check this
Feb 23 11:55:42 <beefd00r>	Hexnewbie: what's wrong with xkb?
Feb 23 11:55:44 <beefd00r>	brb
Feb 23 11:55:57 <hexnewbie>	beefd00r: It works. Things that work are always a problem for Wayland 😜
Feb 23 11:56:38 <hexnewbie>	Although it does have some issues, like the keyboard change combination modifiers cannot be used as modifiers together.
Feb 23 11:57:09 <TuxJobs>	jal`: Did somebody imply that RAM usage would be the/a reason for not wanting systemd? Because I cannot imagine that it would be RAM-hungry on top of everything else. That never even crossed my mind, and I never heard that argument against systemd.
Feb 23 11:57:10 <hexnewbie>	So keyboard layout change with xkb is a pain
Feb 23 11:58:42 <joshua>	hexnewbie: why?
Feb 23 11:59:21 <hexnewbie>	joshua: You either can't switch your layout, or you can't use your keyboard keys
Feb 23 11:59:45 <jal`>	TuxJobs: I don't think the alternatives are faster than systemd either, so the benefits of switching to a nonstandard init system seem to be negligible
Feb 23 12:00:06 <xiaomiao>	'faster' for what?
Feb 23 12:00:15 <jal`>	boot, runtime
Feb 23 12:00:29 <xiaomiao>	systemd is relatively slow
Feb 23 12:00:46 <hexnewbie>	I've never had a left Windows key, on keyboards that lack a right one I've never had a Windows key period. It's been lurking in default key bindings, and commonly in *left hand* keybindings, so on keyboards having two windows keys I have to use two hands
Feb 23 12:01:14 <hexnewbie>	It's still better than never having Ctrl+Shift
Feb 23 12:01:22 <joshua>	hexnewbie: I've found it to be alright personally, except when I'm trying to interface a wayland display. then is doesn't work.
Feb 23 12:02:21 <hexnewbie>	I don't know how Wayland-land deals with xkb. I presume some compositors may provide compatibility with it, just the same way I can use my xkb configuration in my virtual console, but none would actually support proper xkb
Feb 23 12:02:26 <fweht>	how hard would the switch from ubuntu sway remix to arch would be?  i often used arch before, but only with gnome so far...
Feb 23 12:02:45 <hexnewbie>	with xkbcomp, xmodmap, etc.
Feb 23 12:03:39 <fweht>	basically i mostly like sway bc it doesnt draw borders around max size windows...  maybe there is an extension that does the same for gnome?
Feb 23 12:04:42 <joshua>	fweht: he uses arch btw
Feb 23 12:04:45 <hexnewbie>	GNOME definitely doesn't draw borders around... anything these days
Feb 23 12:04:46 <fweht>	but if sway uses less cpu than gnome than i prefer sway...
Feb 23 12:04:59 <hexnewbie>	Unless it's some forrin Qt or non-GTK app ;)
Feb 23 12:05:08 <fweht>	hexnewbie: but i mean if i maximize vscode i have the close button... maybe i dont mean borders but title bar
Feb 23 12:05:25 <joshua>	isn't vscode like super slow tho
Feb 23 12:05:26 <fweht>	in sway vscode extends to the last vertical pixel on the screen
Feb 23 12:05:30 <beefd00r>	hexnewbie: compatibility with xkb? No way, that'd be too much work, no? Just use tools that are made to work with wayland and that's it..?
Feb 23 12:05:51 <hexnewbie>	beefd00r: There aren't such, of course.
Feb 23 12:06:29 <fweht>	joshua: i dont get why ppl say arch is difficult..  it depends on the setup, but with gnome and gdm it really feels like ubuntu minus the bloat but everything works out of the box
Feb 23 12:07:13 <hexnewbie>	fweht: That was tongue-in-cheek, GNOME apps are moving to drawing their own decorations, I guess VS Code isn't one of them. And programs that draw their own don't get any. Anyway, in KDE I disable my fullscreen terminal titlebar (manually)
Feb 23 12:07:19 <hexnewbie>	And sometimes Blender's
Feb 23 12:07:29 <beefd00r>	hexnewbie: Now that's new to me
Feb 23 12:07:58 <hexnewbie>	Though for Blender I was just OK with making it use a dark theme for the titlebar with a window rule
Feb 23 12:08:08 <fweht>	hexnewbie: ah i see!  but i feel for electron apps the title bar is purely gnome?
Feb 23 12:08:12 <joshua>	fweht: I don't think they say Arch is difficult as much as they say that installing it is difficult. Installing arch is a different beast.
Feb 23 12:08:28 <beefd00r>	fweht: Probably because Windows and OS X spoiled everyone
Feb 23 12:08:33 <hexnewbie>	fweht: I don't use Electron apps, can't tell. Chromium proper draws its own titlebar (I disable that)
Feb 23 12:08:38 <joshua>	fweht: windows isn't spoiling anyone, trust me
Feb 23 12:09:16 <beefd00r>	joshua: how's that so?
Feb 23 12:09:28 <joshua>	im taking the piss at windows
Feb 23 12:10:00 <joshua>	i suppose in comparison to arch windows is way less DIY, but then you've got to deal with... yk. windows.
Feb 23 12:10:08 <fweht>	joshua: i just do the bare minimal installation, bios if the hardware supports it (instead of uefi), no partitions, no swap (create swapfile later), etc.
Feb 23 12:10:21 <joshua>	you can install arch with no partitions?
Feb 23 12:10:26 <fweht>	yea
Feb 23 12:10:30 <joshua>	news to me
Feb 23 12:10:33 <joshua>	how/why
Feb 23 12:10:51 <fweht>	i dunno what would i get from partitions?
Feb 23 12:10:54 <fweht>	i like things simple
Feb 23 12:10:58 <MrElendig>	documentation
Feb 23 12:11:00 <MrElendig>	sanity
Feb 23 12:11:02 <hexnewbie>	beefd00r: Generally, in Wayland things that aren't pertaining to the application side of things required for apps to operate on it (i.e. anything that's concerned with administering how your compositor works) is left to the compositor.
Feb 23 12:11:12 <MrElendig>	being able to boot on uefi systems
Feb 23 12:11:18 <joshua>	partitions make it way less likely to shoot yourself in the foot
Feb 23 12:11:22 <joshua>	when doing anything with chmod
Feb 23 12:11:26 <MrElendig>	automatic partition discovery
Feb 23 12:11:28 <fweht>	MrElendig: true, if i have an uefi system i need 2 partitions
Feb 23 12:11:35 <MrElendig>	fweht: technically just one
Feb 23 12:11:43 <fweht>	ah why?
Feb 23 12:11:48 <fweht>	bc the main partition doesnt count?
Feb 23 12:11:50 <MrElendig>	only esp is needed
Feb 23 12:12:07 <fweht>	ah or you count the borders between the partitions as partition :P
Feb 23 12:12:15 <MrElendig>	you could have a efi payload that reads the rest of the system off the "raw" disk
Feb 23 12:12:16 <joshua>	technically no, that's just free space
Feb 23 12:12:28 <MrElendig>	or just make a giant esp and run everything off it
Feb 23 12:12:29 <fweht>	MrElendig: ah cool i never tried this!
Feb 23 12:12:42 <fweht>	i always hate to choose a size for the efi partition
Feb 23 12:13:00 <hexnewbie>	So effectively you need two partitions (and, really, probably three of them)
Feb 23 12:13:04 <joshua>	arch wiki recommends like 15-20 gigs iirc
Feb 23 12:13:08 <fweht>	i want it to be small but there is one thing which i dont need but which needs more space than the rest i forgot which one
Feb 23 12:13:10 <MrElendig>	joshua: lol no
Feb 23 12:13:21 <joshua>	or maybe im thinking of a Luke Smith video
Feb 23 12:13:30 <joshua>	basically the same entity
Feb 23 12:13:32 <fweht>	efistub is cool
Feb 23 12:13:32 <korn3r>	20gigs for efi partition? 0o
Feb 23 12:13:34 <MrElendig>	probably, he is insane enough to suggest 20gig for esp
Feb 23 12:13:44 <MrElendig>	I wouldn't listen to anything he has to say
Feb 23 12:13:54 <korn3r>	i was upset i cant set it to lower than 50 megs
Feb 23 12:13:54 <beefd00r>	joshua: I don't see your point? How is it that Windows does not affect what the average homie thinks of the installation of Arch?
Feb 23 12:13:56 <joshua>	luke smith has some wacky opinions, sure, but he has solid advice on vim and dwm and other stuff like that
Feb 23 12:13:59 <Affliction>	Can fit plenty of bootloaders there!
Feb 23 12:14:20 <Affliction>	bootloader + kernel for 100 different distros? Sorted!
Feb 23 12:14:24 <joshua>	beefd00r: no, i don't think that
Feb 23 12:14:47 <MrElendig>	basically he's basically the andrew tate of the linux world
Feb 23 12:14:52 <joshua>	true
Feb 23 12:15:01 <joshua>	sort of
Feb 23 12:15:17 <MrElendig>	anyway, size depends on use case, if you are only every going to stuff grub on the esp then 128meg is fine
Feb 23 12:15:37 <MrElendig>	if you want 2-3 kernels on there and maybe the windows payload too, 500-1000
Feb 23 12:15:59 <korn3r>	is it even apropriate to put kernels on efi?
Feb 23 12:16:06 <joshua>	I think 1 gigabyte is as high as you should go for an efi partition
Feb 23 12:16:07 <Affliction>	sure, why not?
Feb 23 12:16:09 <MrElendig>	korn3r: yes
Feb 23 12:16:24 <MrElendig>	korn3r: even more so if you us uki
Feb 23 12:17:18 <joshua>	what do you guys think of vim
Feb 23 12:17:22 <MrElendig>	korn3r: in an ideal world you would be using xbootldr, but almost no distores supports it
Feb 23 12:17:38 <zxfx>	vim is ez
Feb 23 12:17:51 <MrElendig>	though not much benefit of using xbootldr if you are not dualbooting anyway
Feb 23 12:17:59 <joshua>	zxfx i haven't heard that in a while
Feb 23 12:18:00 <MrElendig>	dualbooting other gnu/linux systems even
Feb 23 12:18:07 <zxfx>	it is tho
Feb 23 12:18:30 <MrElendig>	joshua: it's fine, but neovim is better
Feb 23 12:18:32 <joshua>	well, comparing it to something like Emacs, sure. But other click-and-point editors, its very hard
Feb 23 12:18:43 <zxfx>	not really
Feb 23 12:18:46 <joshua>	MrElendig: Yes, i think vim9script was a mistake
Feb 23 12:18:55 <MrElendig>	vim9script is fine
Feb 23 12:19:15 <joshua>	it's fine, but it introduced things that lua already has, so it's sort of pointless
Feb 23 12:19:29 <joshua>	it makes neovim a better alternative
Feb 23 12:19:35 <MrElendig>	but neovim got a lot more code cleanup and nicer features added
Feb 23 12:20:03 <joshua>	no, i'm saying vim9script was pointless not neovim
Feb 23 12:20:19 <MrElendig>	vim9 was needed really
Feb 23 12:20:47 <joshua>	it certainly helped for people that were die-hard vim fans that don't want to switch to neovim. stuff like classes brings a lot more to the plugin ecosystem especially.
Feb 23 12:21:07 <MrElendig>	and I can understand why they decided to dsl instead of use lua/whatever
Feb 23 12:21:25 <joshua>	yea, thats fair enough. but there are also many advantages to using lua
Feb 23 12:21:50 <MrElendig>	personally I'm not a fan of lua
Feb 23 12:22:03 <joshua>	fr. like what kind of language starts counting at 1?
Feb 23 12:22:24 <MrElendig>	but neovim is moving in the direction of a full api so you could write your extension in anything you want(*)
Feb 23 12:22:25 <joshua>	out of context that would seem like a really stupid thing to say actually
Feb 23 12:22:38 <MrElendig>	*some limitations applies
Feb 23 12:22:41 <joshua>	MrElendig: that's cool, i didn't know that
Feb 23 12:22:59 <joshua>	so you could write it in c, for example
Feb 23 12:23:22 <MrElendig>	the original plan did get toned down quite a bit, but its still moving forward
Feb 23 12:23:46 <joshua>	I still use vim, personally, because it works better on my crappy i3 processor
Feb 23 12:23:52 <joshua>	than nvim
Feb 23 12:24:03 <MrElendig>	anyway, vim9script is a lesser brain shift from viml than going to lua would
Feb 23 12:24:42 <MrElendig>	if the move off from viml had happen after bran, then I would suspect that something else would have been picked though
Feb 23 12:24:57 <joshua>	yea i agree
Feb 23 12:25:16 <MrElendig>	sidenote: you can use lua in vim >= 8 too, but its somewhat lacking
Feb 23 12:25:27 <joshua>	but viml -> vim9script would be easy to migrate to since they are the same language.
Feb 23 12:25:40 <joshua>	what did sidenote say, i didn't see his message
Feb 23 12:26:06 <joshua>	wait
Feb 23 12:26:08 <joshua>	im an idiot
Feb 23 12:26:09 <joshua>	nvm
Feb 23 12:26:17 <dviola>	the only thing I miss in vim that neovim has is xdg support
Feb 23 12:26:32 <dviola>	even tmux supports it nowadays
Feb 23 12:26:38 <joshua>	that was unironically one of the stupidest things ive ever done
Feb 23 12:26:39 <MrElendig>	built in treesitter
Feb 23 12:27:15 <joshua>	dviola: vim supports tmux as well iirc
Feb 23 12:27:59 <joshua>	at least to the extend of 256 color support and things like that. although, you have to do a few tweaks in the tmux config file
Feb 23 12:28:03 <dviola>	joshua: yes, I am referring to where vim stores configuration files, not tmux support
Feb 23 12:28:13 <joshua>	oh ok
Feb 23 12:29:17 <TuxJobs>	jal`: I don't understand you. Why would a system for launching applications take any RAM or time to speak of?
Feb 23 12:29:43 <joshua>	what was their original message
Feb 23 12:29:59 <MrElendig>	TuxJobs: ask the kernel devs that
Feb 23 12:30:10 <joshua>	?
Feb 23 12:31:36 <TuxJobs>	(Have to reboot now for yet another test which will likely fail.)
Feb 23 12:32:49 <joshua>	You have to.... reboot? for a test?? tf?
Feb 23 12:32:55 <joshua>	like a unit test or?
Feb 23 12:33:01 <joshua>	what is that guy on
Feb 23 12:33:36 <katia>	integration test of the bootloader
Feb 23 12:33:45 <joshua>	surely just use a vm
Feb 23 12:35:19 <Blackbird1>	Hi from New Zealand, any other kiwis here
Feb 23 12:36:01 <joshua>	hello. im not from NZ, but its nice to meet u
Feb 23 12:36:48 <Blackbird1>	nice to meet you too
Feb 23 12:36:52 <Blackbird1>	joshua
Feb 23 12:37:07 <GundamGuy>	evening all
Feb 23 12:37:16 <Blackbird1>	Good evening GundamGuy
Feb 23 12:37:21 <joshua>	evening
Feb 23 12:37:44 <Blackbird1>	The truth is I'm on windows, i love linux but haven't made the jump
Feb 23 12:38:01 <beefd00r>	Oh
Feb 23 12:38:06 <joshua>	Blackbird1: it's good that WSL exists, so that you can get the best of both worlds
Feb 23 12:38:14 <Blackbird1>	WSL?
Feb 23 12:38:18 <joshua>	windows subsystem for linux?
Feb 23 12:38:22 *	MrElendig watches as a kea eats Blackbird1's computer
Feb 23 12:38:22 <Blackbird1>	oh
Feb 23 12:38:34 <Blackbird1>	its just the command line isn't it?
Feb 23 12:38:38 <joshua>	yep
Feb 23 12:38:46 <MrElendig>	you can run gui apps in wsl
Feb 23 12:38:52 <Blackbird1>	oh
Feb 23 12:39:00 <Blackbird1>	We are all slaves to windows
Feb 23 12:39:06 <Blackbird1>	well I am
Feb 23 12:39:18 <joshua>	let's hope your liberation comes soon
Feb 23 12:39:42 <joshua>	wb
Feb 23 12:39:46 <dviola>	Blackbird1: what's keeping you on windows? out of curiosity
Feb 23 12:39:58 <beefd00r>	Blackbird1: I'm not I once got 5 blue screens in less than 24 hours and decided I'm not coming back :>
Feb 23 12:40:09 <joshua>	beefd00r: YiKeS
Feb 23 12:40:37 <Blackbird1>	Well I'm 40 and I was brought up with Windows, i love the the concept behind linux but its a leap
Feb 23 12:40:37 <dviola>	Blackbird1: what's preventing you from switching?
Feb 23 12:40:49 <Blackbird1>	I work in tech and its all windows
Feb 23 12:40:56 <MrElendig>	Blackbird1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGz7Ou0Nwo8
Feb 23 12:41:03 <MrElendig>	the first 20 sec
Feb 23 12:41:04 <Blackbird1>	ok ill watch
Feb 23 12:41:13 <MrElendig>	can skip the rest
Feb 23 12:41:35 <joshua>	first it was helix, now it's zed, when will it end....
Feb 23 12:41:50 <TuxJobs>	Infuriating systemd problem: I have a user .service file which, if I run it with `systemctl --user start MyCustomApp.service` from a terminal, behaves correctly and thus opens an XTerm window in the right taskbar group. BUT if I let it start at boot, it opens the XTerm window in the default "XTerm" taskbar group, seemingly ignoring the actual command. I've tried so many things and each attempt requires a full reboot of the whole system. I have no idea what
Feb 23 12:41:50 <TuxJobs>	else to try at this point. The ~/.config/systemd/user/MyCustomApp.service file: https://pastebin.com/raw/Gn47L1xx ... I've tried with and without "WantedBy=multi-user.target", and with and without "After=graphical-session.target". I've also tried adding `ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 20` as well as `Environment=DISPLAY=:0` and `XAUTHORITY=/home/a/.Xauthority` to the [Service] section. Same thing keeps happening. Nothing seems to make it behave the same on boot
Feb 23 12:41:51 <TuxJobs>	as it does when manually started...
Feb 23 12:41:58 <beefd00r>	oh lord
Feb 23 12:42:16 <joshua>	TuxJobs: have you tried postponing the task
Feb 23 12:42:33 <joshua>	TuxJobs:  have you tried turning it off and on again
Feb 23 12:42:38 <TuxJobs>	joshua: What's `ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 20` look like?
Feb 23 12:42:46 <joshua>	an attempt
Feb 23 12:43:03 <beefd00r>	TuxJobs: What's a taskbar group?
Feb 23 12:43:06 <TuxJobs>	"turning it off and on again" <-- Numerous times.
Feb 23 12:43:15 <joshua>	 /s
Feb 23 12:43:16 <TuxJobs>	beefd00r: Where multiple instances of the same program/class "group".
Feb 23 12:43:45 <TuxJobs>	beefd00r: For example if you have 100 XTerm terminals opened (with no special -class given), they go into a single "taskbar group" which you click to bring up a list of them.
Feb 23 12:44:07 <GundamGuy>	the hammer method always worked for me
Feb 23 12:44:18 <joshua>	the.... hammer method?
Feb 23 12:44:26 <Gurkenglas>	A program, say foo, behaves differently the first and second time I run it, so I wanted to see how the disk changes in between. In lieu of knowing how to do that, I tried strace foo, but ptrace wasn't permitted. So I tried sudo strace foo, but foo said not to run it as root. So I tried sudo strace sudo -u user foo, but then it crashed on startup. I
Feb 23 12:44:26 <Gurkenglas>	think that means the last line doesn't do what I think it does, so I came here to ask.
Feb 23 12:44:26 <TuxJobs>	GundamGuy: Hammering the computer will only feel good for a split second, but then I'm without a computer.
Feb 23 12:44:28 <GundamGuy>	yeah. it's easy
Feb 23 12:44:29 <beefd00r>	TuxJobs: Oh it's like a seperate icon on the taskbar?
Feb 23 12:44:34 <beefd00r>	"seperate icon" bruh
Feb 23 12:44:39 <beefd00r>	you know what I mean
Feb 23 12:44:49 <GundamGuy>	smash it with a hammer then buy an new computer.
Feb 23 12:44:51 <TuxJobs>	beefd00r: Yes, two different "XTerms".
Feb 23 12:45:12 <joshua>	GundamGuy: I don't say this lightly,I think you've just broken the 4th wall
Feb 23 12:45:18 <beefd00r>	Have you taken a look at the process tree?
Feb 23 12:45:21 <joshua>	and probably more than 4 computers
Feb 23 12:45:34 <beefd00r>	TuxJobs: `pstree`
Feb 23 12:45:43 <TuxJobs>	beefd00r: No. What would that do?
Feb 23 12:46:00 <joshua>	isn't that just the same as `top` with tree mode
Feb 23 12:46:18 <Blackbird1>	I'm going to bring out the most original cliche from internet chat, I may be judged, where is everyone from?
Feb 23 12:46:25 <GundamGuy>	well. my computer is over 15 years old. i think i woud be doing it a favor.
Feb 23 12:46:27 <joshua>	Sydney, australia
Feb 23 12:46:31 <beefd00r>	TuxJobs: Perhaps the way your desktop environment groups applications together on the taskbar is affected by who started the process to begin with
Feb 23 12:46:36 <beefd00r>	That's just my speculation
Feb 23 12:46:37 <Blackbird1>	Yeah boy we lost the cricket tonight to aus
Feb 23 12:46:49 <joshua>	GundamGuy: it's already on life support, jut put it out of its misery
Feb 23 12:47:16 <TuxJobs>	beefd00r: Well, I'm user "a", so it's me doing it when I do it manually. And it's a "user" systemd .service, so it means that user "a" is the owner etc.
Feb 23 12:47:31 <GundamGuy>	joshua it shows sings of life...now and then..
Feb 23 12:47:35 <Blackbird1>	I'm a kiwi but I'm dating an Australian girl, love her accent.
Feb 23 12:47:41 <TuxJobs>	GundamGuy: Out of interest, what DE do you run on that thing?
Feb 23 12:47:49 <TuxJobs>	Since Plasma barely runs on my < 5 year old monster.
Feb 23 12:48:02 <TuxJobs>	Admittedly with crappy NVIDIA hardware.
Feb 23 12:48:05 <joshua>	GundamGuy: does it sometimes make faint noises. you know, like "help me" and "I'm dying, stop using windows"
Feb 23 12:48:25 <GundamGuy>	yeah...windows 11

Feb 23 14:47:05 <peetaur>	if it was simply blamed on you, the solution is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchens's_razor
Feb 23 14:47:25 <Helenah>	adv8tor: server manager as in the person who manages the server? Well yeah, if the network interface configuration files mysteriously vanished them of course he's gonna go looking for a human culprit because that's all it could ever be.
Feb 23 14:47:45 <Khaytsus>	And why do you think it was ip delete?  Is that a guess/assumption?
Feb 23 14:48:03 <adv8tor>	This happened after a reboot. Both times, the system was acting really weird where I couldn't restart services (like MySQL)
Feb 23 14:48:49 <adv8tor>	Helenah: not exactly I'm the only technical person at my org and the CEO told me because I don't have direct access to the server
Feb 23 14:49:30 <Helenah>	The ip command doesn't have the power to do file manipulations though, you need to look elsewhere.
Feb 23 14:49:44 <adv8tor>	Khaytsus: not ip delete but the interface. When I went in to investigate, I couldn't see anything

Feb 23 14:52:22 <peetaur>	how can anything be blamed on you if you don't have access to do anything?
Feb 23 14:52:43 <somenick>	managers have to blame someone anyway.... :P
Feb 23 14:52:48 <Helenah>	peetaur: That's where I'm confused.
Feb 23 14:52:49 <Kaliroot>	Bad org
Feb 23 14:53:13 <adv8tor>	After I rebooted it, it never came back. So my boss loaded the KVM console through ovh and I ran 'ip a' then
Feb 23 14:53:15 <Helenah>	somenick: Yeah, but they should also have proper auditing before they point fingers towards someone who apparently shouldn't have access.
Feb 23 14:53:28 <somenick>	indeed.
Feb 23 14:53:30 <Helenah>	Like what indicates this person bust through a locked door.
Feb 23 14:53:44 <adv8tor>	I have terminal access, but that's it. Sorry should have been more clear
Feb 23 14:53:44 <Gurkenglas>	guys, i suspect you are running off with a misunderstanding.
Feb 23 14:53:46 <Helenah>	adv8tor: The company you work for sounds bad if I'm honest with you.
Feb 23 14:53:51 <Inline>	me ?
Feb 23 14:54:12 <Khaytsus>	adv8tor: I think you're combining multiple assumptions here, it's confusing and I don't think he's helping.  Sorry.
Feb 23 14:54:15 <adv8tor>	It's incredibly toxic, I'm dying to get out :(
Feb 23 14:54:26 <Khaytsus>	erm, don't think IT is helping"
Feb 23 14:54:37 <Khaytsus>	Go with the facts, not guesses please
Feb 23 14:55:02 <Kaliroot>	Terminal access! You can control the server
Feb 23 14:55:10 <steering>	adv8tor: with the config file that tells the system how to set up networking at boot gone, it would indeed not set up networking at boot.
Feb 23 14:55:13 <Khaytsus>	I state again, ip would not remove files in /etc
Feb 23 14:55:17 <adv8tor>	Ok sorry. I have very little to work with as well. All conversations are happening with the CEO and I'm not privy to those. So I have very diluted information
Feb 23 14:55:26 <steering>	adv8tor: the question is when and why did /etc/network/interfaces disappear.
Feb 23 14:55:46 <Inline>	i don't even have that /etc/network/interfaces
Feb 23 14:55:52 <Inline>	seems to be distro specific
Feb 23 14:55:56 <steering>	Inline: yes.
Feb 23 14:55:58 <Khaytsus>	Inline: Distro specific or configuraiton specific.
Feb 23 14:56:00 <Inline>	on debian you'll have it
Feb 23 14:56:05 <peetaur>	is it possible /etc/network/interfaces isn't supposed to exist because you use /etc/network/interfaces.d/* ?
Feb 23 14:56:08 <Inline>	on others not always
Feb 23 14:56:24 <steering>	Fri@0645.07> < adv8tor> They had to be manually added back in /etc/network/interfaces
Feb 23 14:56:31 <peetaur>	if you use network manager, connman, etc.  you might not have /etc/network/interfaces/*
Feb 23 14:56:33 <steering>	clearly they are on a system which uses it, Inline.
Feb 23 14:56:39 <adv8tor>	The server is Ubuntu 20.04
Feb 23 14:56:41 <Inline>	depending on the init system, other stuff like /etc/systemd/network etc. might be relevant too
Feb 23 14:56:49 <Inline>	ah ok
Feb 23 14:56:53 <Helenah>	adv8tor: Then your organisation lacks transparency, and that's a red flag.
Feb 23 14:57:04 <peetaur>	or netplan.io
Feb 23 14:57:39 <Helenah>	If someone was to blame me for something, I'd expect full disclosure of information from them.
Feb 23 14:57:42 <adv8tor>	Facts: system was acting weird(couldn't restart any services). after restarting, had no interfaces in 'ip a' and no internet access
Feb 23 14:58:12 <Khaytsus>	Since it's a VM, you sure someone hasn't messed with the interfaces KVM provides?
Feb 23 14:58:14 <Gurkenglas>	adv8tor: "I ran 'ip a' then" <- do you do all your work by typing into a single window, running commands one at a time in a terminal? That would be handy because then you could look at eg ~/.bash_history to double-check what all you did.
Feb 23 14:58:58 <peetaur>	adv8tor: what does "had no interfaces" mean? if you remove the config, it'll just have the basics (lo, physical networks, probably down and without ip ...if up, then an autogenerated ipv6 probably)
Feb 23 14:59:03 <Khaytsus>	adv8tor: Are you saying right now there's NO network intefaces available to the vm?  If so, that's at the kVM level.
Feb 23 14:59:06 <adv8tor>	Who could do anything like that? I did check bash history for users with Sudo access
Feb 23 14:59:15 <Khaytsus>	No, at the _host_
Feb 23 15:00:02 <adv8tor>	peetaur: it only had the loopback. Not even ens
Feb 23 15:00:10 <peetaur>	the interfaces not existing in `ip l` outputdoesn't necessarily mean they don't exist in the system... check in things like lspci [-k], ls /sys/class/net, etc. too. If it's virtio-net, look in lsmod for virtio-net being loaded.
Feb 23 15:00:13 <Kaliroot>	Have you tried ifconfig
Feb 23 15:00:16 <ananke>	adv8tor: you may want to inspect the logs, and check package updates
Feb 23 15:00:25 <TuxJobs>	adv8tor: Don't evil hackers paste a script into the terminal the last thing they do which cleans away all traces of them doing anything and then log them out in a stealthy manner, making it seem like nobody was there?
Feb 23 15:00:26 <ananke>	Kaliroot: ifconfig won't show stuff that ip doesn't show
Feb 23 15:00:27 <adv8tor>	They came back when someone manually added the interfaces files
Feb 23 15:00:38 <Khaytsus>	that makes no sense to me
Feb 23 15:00:49 <Khaytsus>	ip addr would show all interfaces, configured or not
Feb 23 15:00:54 <peetaur>	TuxJobs: noobs... preventing all traces is the first thing you do, not clean away all traces
Feb 23 15:01:07 <peetaur>	cuz otherwise on crash there's traces
Feb 23 15:01:11 <adv8tor>	peetaur: ok thanks. I'll try that if that happens again
Feb 23 15:01:12 <Gurkenglas>	adv8tor: Do you mean you checked the bash history of a personal machine of yours, or of every user on the server, or what?
Feb 23 15:01:45 <adv8tor>	ananke: I scoured through thousands of journalctl lines. Nothing popped up
Feb 23 15:02:44 <adv8tor>	Gurkenglas: all users (me and someone who basically can't use Linux)
Feb 23 15:02:56 <Kaliroot>	ananke: but it turn on an interface
Feb 23 15:03:14 <ananke>	Kaliroot: no. 'ifconfig' by itself does not turn on any interfaces
Feb 23 15:03:26 <adv8tor>	I'm confused. Does ip a show all interfaces or not? Because it only had lo
Feb 23 15:03:52 <adv8tor>	Additionally, the resolv.conf file was also absent
Feb 23 15:04:19 <Gurkenglas>	adv8tor: "scoured through thousands of journalctl lines" <- manually? are there thousands more left?
Feb 23 15:04:27 <Helenah>	resolve.conf is absent too? o.o
Feb 23 15:04:29 <ananke>	I'm fairly sure 'ip a' shows all interfaces, regardless of whether they have an actual IP settings or not
Feb 23 15:04:33 <Helenah>	That should never be absent...
Feb 23 15:04:40 <Helenah>	ananke: It does
Feb 23 15:04:43 <Kaliroot>	Sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
Feb 23 15:04:47 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Khaytsus
Feb 23 15:04:49 *	Khaytsus sets quiet on *!*@user/Kaliroot
Feb 23 15:04:50 <Gurkenglas>	adv8tor: "They came back when someone manually added the interfaces files" <- where did they get the interface files?
Feb 23 15:05:01 <Khaytsus>	Kaliroot: You're not helping one bit, just adding noise.  Cut it out.
Feb 23 15:05:07 <adv8tor>	Gurkenglas: unfortunately yes. I went through the rough time this happened but can't be sure
Feb 23 15:05:17 <Khaytsus>	adv8tor: That _really_ sounds like some.......  filesystem error or something.  Are other files missing?
Feb 23 15:05:34 <Helenah>	I never thought of that, Khaytsus
Feb 23 15:05:39 <Helenah>	But it is valid point.
Feb 23 15:06:07 <Helenah>	adv8tor: Is you or anyone able to check the disk state, and did you or they?
Feb 23 15:06:10 <adv8tor>	Khaytsus: nothing seemed off but good point, I'll try running a fsck
Feb 23 15:06:27 <Helenah>	adv8tor: Maybe smartd is set up on there too.
Feb 23 15:06:39 <Helenah>	Wait... I forgot, this is a VM?
Feb 23 15:06:48 <adv8tor>	It is, yes
Feb 23 15:06:53 <Helenah>	Such would be running on the host, smartd I mean.
Feb 23 15:06:59 <Helenah>	If is on there at all.
Feb 23 15:08:03 <Helenah>	adv8tor: You can also check dmesg for I/O errors.
Feb 23 15:08:32 <adv8tor>	I won't be able to fsck because it'll need to be run when it's unmounted.
Feb 23 15:08:32 <Khaytsus>	Almost smells like someone did something really silly manually on that system...  I still say if no interfaces show up at all, that's at the host level though.
Feb 23 15:08:33 <Gurkenglas>	adv8tor: "the first time this happened" <- oh, if it's reproducible, maybe you can catch the cause next time? using eg auditd
Feb 23 15:11:01 *	Gurkenglas .oO(save a list of all files on the filesystem to a file, do it again later, diff the files, see if anything is disappearing)
Feb 23 15:12:28 <peetaur>	adv8tor: btw another way to remove an interface is unload the driver.... modprobe -r virtio-net
Feb 23 15:12:39 <peetaur>	(will refuse if you don't `ip l down ...` first)
Feb 23 15:12:58 <adv8tor>	Helenah: interesting so it says the partition was not properly unmounted for some reason
Feb 23 15:13:07 <Helenah>	o.O
Feb 23 15:13:17 <Helenah>	Someone definitely done something silly...
Feb 23 15:13:22 <oerheks>	weird story, ' no access to the server' .. on KVM...
Feb 23 15:13:35 <Khaytsus>	system unresponsive, filesystem issues..  I wonder if the host machine is running out of resources and shut down VMs
Feb 23 15:13:41 <adv8tor>	peetaur: yes I think I had run modprobe but it came up that it was loaded
Feb 23 15:13:52 *	Khaytsus removes channel operator status from Khaytsus
Feb 23 15:13:56 <Helenah>	Yeah, even not monitoring the host would be a silly thing.
Feb 23 15:14:00 <fweht>	why does it seem like no individual process consumes much cpu but alltogheter im still around 20 % all the time? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/APnsGytu/image.png
Feb 23 15:14:56 <adv8tor>	oerheks: yes sorry I should've been clearer. I do have access, but only shell. If I want to do anything, like monitor it or access it from the KVM console I need to ask someone else
Feb 23 15:15:36 <Gurkenglas>	fweht: I regret to inform you that those numbers add up to 16-17. (also, the column is apparently not actually sorted by descending cpu usage? so maybe there's something yet further down.)
Feb 23 15:15:41 <peetaur>	you don't have access to the server but you can run modprobe?
Feb 23 15:15:50 <fweht>	Gurkenglas: ah true :D
Feb 23 15:16:06 <adv8tor>	Khaytsus: maybe that makes sense? Top showed very little resource use for me, but the ovh monitoring tools allegedly showed 100%
Feb 23 15:16:18 <Helenah>	adv8tor: Is there some sort of sudo setup going on?
Feb 23 15:16:29 <Helenah>	You seem to be able to do something but not others on there...
Feb 23 15:16:32 <hodapp>	uggh, XFCE always does this thing where when I switch monitor layouts (from office back to home) the window manager or something thinks the screen is still at the wrong resolution
Feb 23 15:16:51 <hodapp>	so the toolbars are all sized wrong, some windows can't be moved to the right or bottom of the screen
Feb 23 15:16:57 <Helenah>	And it makes zero sense...
Feb 23 15:17:12 <hodapp>	and no amount of messing with display settings seems to kick it out of this state - only logging out and back in
Feb 23 15:17:45 <peetaur>	fweht: if you look at the yellow bars, and average (that green part of the 32 gets hidden after averaging in with that green part of the 2% for example), you get the average user% ...and that's what the CPU is showing...and it seems to match. Then the red is more like sys or another thing (I dont' remember what color is what on htop). And sys is not in the CPU% column.
Feb 23 15:17:56 <peetaur>	s/yellow/green/ whatever
Feb 23 15:17:58 <adv8tor>	Helenah: sorry. What do you mean? Nothing fancy. I'm the one that uses it the most, someone else only accesses it through some PHP console
Feb 23 15:18:16 <Helenah>	adv8tor: You can access modprobe but not other things...
Feb 23 15:18:17 <fweht>	peetaur: thanks...  maybe its just my feeling, i installed a new system and now the fan blows all the time, but could be something about gpu as well
Feb 23 15:18:22 <Helenah>	Why is that?
Feb 23 15:18:58 <peetaur>	what slow cpu is this where htop uses 2.6%? on my ryzen set to a fast interval it doesn't even show more than 0.0%... on a kvm it spikes to 0.7% but stays mostly 0.0%
Feb 23 15:18:59 <adv8tor>	I can access things like normal through SSH. But any telemetry or access through the KVM, no
Feb 23 15:19:04 <Gurkenglas>	fweht: does it blow any stronger if you use 100%?
Feb 23 15:19:27 <fweht>	i guess so, but before it didnt blow at all
Feb 23 15:19:38 <peetaur>	fweht: the loudest fans are the smallest fans...often gpu fans are way too small
Feb 23 15:20:26 <Gurkenglas>	fweht: check the sensor temperatures? (ideally you remember temp values from a previous installation...) i could imagine that your system tries to target a lower temp now?
Feb 23 15:21:06 <fweht>	Gurkenglas: good point, unfortunately i never did that before!  but will definitely check!
Feb 23 15:21:28 <Helenah>	adv8tor: Why are you left to fix such an issue but denied access by other means?
Feb 23 15:21:38 <OnkelTem>	ImageMagick is breaking palette while cropping PNG images. I tried to find a fix but failed. Asked a question on StackOverflow here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78048025/imagemagick-is-breaking-palette-of-png-image-while-cropping-chopping
Feb 23 15:21:57 <Helenah>	There's some pretty good hypervisor panels out there with access controls.
Feb 23 15:22:27 <fweht>	seems to be cpu though... https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/tsRTFpA2/image.png
Feb 23 15:22:55 <fweht>	but cpu is at 15-20 % all the time
Feb 23 15:26:25 <Gurkenglas>	as a layman, i am confused by the combination of "20% all the time" and "fans are blowing" and "99 degrees Celsius"
Feb 23 15:26:53 <Gurkenglas>	did you as part of installing the knew system put the air outtake up against a wall?
Feb 23 15:26:58 <Gurkenglas>	s/knew/new/
Feb 23 15:27:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	99c is something i never worry about
Feb 23 15:27:20 <peetaur>	Gurkenglas: 20% cpu,gpu load?  99°C is way too hot for idle, regardless of the rest
Feb 23 15:27:31 <peetaur>	if it's an old machine, maybe you have to just clean it and replace the thermal paste
Feb 23 15:27:39 <fweht>	ok Gurkenglas ^^ no its a laptop and im sitting at a library with normal room temperature rn
Feb 23 15:27:50 <peetaur>	99 is probably fine for an intel laptop, and sounds hot for mostly anything else
Feb 23 15:28:07 <peetaur>	at non-idle....but at idle it sounds insane
Feb 23 15:28:09 <fweht>	peetaur: thats true, but it pretty sure changed after reinstalling the system so i suspect some correlation here
Feb 23 15:28:30 <Gurkenglas>	fweht: try putting it on full load and seeing how the temperature changes?
Feb 23 15:28:34 <fweht>	although i just went from ubuntu 23.04 to ubuntu sway remix 23.04 so it should have the same underlyings
Feb 23 15:28:43 <peetaur>	on a laptop maybe powertop will tell you something
Feb 23 15:29:19 <fweht>	peetaur: aah good catch maybe ubuntu implemented more aggressive power saving!
Feb 23 15:29:19 <peetaur>	yeah testing full load is a good idea...unless it massively overheats. Make sur eto check dmesg for those "too hot so throttling" messages where it means your load will likely not cause any more heat than your low load.
Feb 23 15:29:33 <peetaur>	or melts
Feb 23 15:29:36 <fweht>	should i just run a loop in js in the browser?
Feb 23 15:30:09 <Gurkenglas>	i would go with whatever you have previously done which put the machine under full load and apparently didnt melt it
Feb 23 15:30:12 <peetaur>	if js is all you know, sounds fine.....otherwise sounds like the worst scripting language to use :D
Feb 23 15:30:39 <somenick>	OnkelTem, I ran your command and it worked without breaking anything. https://eboardresults.com/app/misc/tmp/out.png
Feb 23 15:30:42 <fweht>	i know some haskell but havent it installed yet ^^
Feb 23 15:33:39 <fweht>	running it under high load didnt seem to make the cpus hotter https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ISganPyE/image.png
Feb 23 15:33:42 <fweht>	maybe the sensors are broken
Feb 23 15:33:46 <Gurkenglas>	i dont see how "more aggressive power saving" would cause *more* cpu/fan usage
Feb 23 15:33:56 <Gurkenglas>	fweht: did it make the fans louder?
Feb 23 15:34:02 <fweht>	Gurkenglas: no what i thought was that the old ubuntu did more power saving than my new install
Feb 23 15:34:04 <fweht>	no
Feb 23 15:34:12 <peetaur>	fweht: that last screenshot does not look like full load... you should see like 98-100% on all of those
Feb 23 15:34:35 <fweht>	ok i guess the js loop was single threaded
Feb 23 15:34:54 <korn3r>	fweht: its probably throttlinh. temps are insane
Feb 23 15:34:59 <fweht>	what scripting lang do you prefer over js peetaur
Feb 23 15:35:00 <korn3r>	throttling
Feb 23 15:35:24 <Gurkenglas>	fweht: i expected you to just open 8 tabs of that js loop ^^
Feb 23 15:35:25 <peetaur>	fweht: here's a quick like 5-10s benchmark with full load in bash (requires bc, which you possibly don't have installed)        time for n in {1..8}; do time echo "2^1200000" | bc >/dev/null & done
Feb 23 15:36:00 <silly>	or `stress -c 4` if you have it installed
Feb 23 15:36:04 <peetaur>	change the 1.2M to some higher number for longer run
Feb 23 15:36:22 <oerheks>	fweht, what cpu exactly?
Feb 23 15:37:02 <fweht>	thinkpad t490 nothing special i guess.. still believe its about the system, maybe the sensors arent right?
Feb 23 15:37:28 <Gurkenglas>	fweht: does the laptop feel hot
Feb 23 15:37:47 <fweht>	Gurkenglas: bottom feels hott-ish but not insanely so
Feb 23 15:37:54 <fweht>	also air which blows out is warm
Feb 23 15:38:11 <Guest20>	KS
Feb 23 15:39:04 <Gurkenglas>	yeah 100 degrees *in the CPU* doesn't mean it'll scald you for putting it on your lap ^^
Feb 23 15:39:23 <Gurkenglas>	do you remember how hot it felt before this system
Feb 23 15:39:32 <Khaytsus>	If your cpu is 100C and the air blowing out isn't also quite warm, seems like your heat sink isn't working well
Feb 23 15:39:48 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps it's not really that hot..  perhaps lmsensors is confused
Feb 23 15:40:58 <Gurkenglas>	you could look around if someone has a laptop like yours and ask to check if the relationship between their core temp and felt air temp is consistent with yours
Feb 23 15:41:12 <oerheks>	check for a bios update, many posts about overheating
Feb 23 15:41:16 <fweht>	Gurkenglas: thanks a lot for the inputs
Feb 23 15:41:35 <fweht>	i think ill ignore it for now and get some work done and keep observing it the next days
Feb 23 15:41:43 <fweht>	if it feels off and maybe install fedora again
Feb 23 15:42:29 <Gurkenglas>	teehee i'll take that as a hint not to suggest plans that involve meatbag interaction
Feb 23 15:42:37 <bwjr>	Hi. I use zip to create a zip file. The file utility shows the compression method as store. I'm not specifying store (-0). I tried compress faster (-1) and compress better (-9) but file command still shows the compression method as store.
Feb 23 15:43:13 <Gurkenglas>	fweht: one more thing: you could try livebooting another system
Feb 23 15:43:40 <fweht>	Gurkenglas: yes, thats what ill try with fedora!
Feb 23 15:43:55 <ananke>	bwjr: did you check if the file sizes are actually different?
Feb 23 15:44:19 <silly>	iirc those sensors don't return a value like 21°C but rather 0.4553 and there's some table for that sensor where the system can look up for a factor to use to calculate the raw value to temperature, maybe the package with those tables is broken? i'd try my way through different distros
Feb 23 15:44:42 <bwjr>	ananke, yes, the rezipped file is bigger.
Feb 23 15:45:30 <ananke>	bwjr: though looking at a random sample of 100 files, the only two types of compression identified by 'file' tool for zip files are either method=deflate or method=store
Feb 23 15:45:31 <PurpleYew73>	Hello
Feb 23 15:45:31 <Gurkenglas>	silly: i bet against that :D it sounds way too specific
Feb 23 15:45:51 <PurpleYew73>	Hello
Feb 23 15:46:26 <bwjr>	ananke, the original file = "Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=deflate", the new file: "Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract, compression method=store"
Feb 23 15:47:05 <bwjr>	The original file came from Windows if that matters.
Feb 23 15:47:59 <fweht>	silly: interesting thought, thanks!
Feb 23 15:48:05 <phogg>	bwjr: did you read the zip man page? It goes in to this sort of thing.
Feb 23 15:48:32 <Gurkenglas>	Is there a tool that "compresses" your disk by comparing hashes of your files against online databases and replacing files that can be downloaded later with their hash?
Feb 23 15:48:46 <ananke>	bwjr: what options did you use to create that zip file?
Feb 23 15:49:10 <Khaytsus>	zip can store files it can't compress and deflate on files it can..  I suspect if ANY file is "store" it just reports 'store'  zip tells you how much it compresses it while doing it.
Feb 23 15:49:13 <ananke>	Gurkenglas: that would be 'deduplication' not 'compression'
Feb 23 15:49:16 <Khaytsus>	deflated 82% etc
Feb 23 15:49:28 <bwjr>	ananke: -rmv (also -1 and separately -9)
Feb 23 15:49:31 <phogg>	bwjr: certain file suffixes are not stored with deflate by default. You can use -n : to try to deflate everything.
Feb 23 15:50:00 <Khaytsus>	Ha, cute, if you zip test.zip binary text    it reports store, if you put the text file in first, it reports "deflate".  So it appears to just be looking at the first file.
Feb 23 15:50:36 <phogg>	Khaytsus: interesting... I would expect it to look at each file separately.
Feb 23 15:50:46 <Khaytsus>	phogg: What would it show?  store+deflate?
Feb 23 15:51:10 <Khaytsus>	Again, when doing hte zip, it does show the compression ratio.
Feb 23 15:51:32 <Khaytsus>	Why the "same files" compressed on Windows vs Linux would differ greatly I don't know..
Feb 23 15:51:36 <phogg>	Khaytsus: I am under the impression it can choose per file, not per archive
Feb 23 15:51:39 <phogg>	maybe I'm mistaken
Feb 23 15:51:49 <silly>	fweht, https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-admits-ThinkPad-CPU-throttling-problem-when-running-Linux-fix-in-development.435549.0.html
Feb 23 15:51:53 <yustin>	"store - Setting the compression method to store forces zip to store entries with no compression."
Feb 23 15:51:59 <Khaytsus>	phogg: Just saying it appears at a _glance_ that file only looks at the first file in the archve
Feb 23 15:52:03 <fweht>	ah wow!
Feb 23 15:52:18 <phogg>	Khaytsus: ah yes, file does. I thought you meant zip does.
Feb 23 15:52:26 <silly>	too bad they don't mention temperatures anywhere
Feb 23 15:52:53 <Khaytsus>	phogg: Yeah.  even just tried creating a zip of one binary first then a ton of txt file after....  file says store.  :)
Feb 23 15:53:03 <Khaytsus>	even though most compressed at like 80%
Feb 23 15:53:20 <phogg>	Khaytsus: unzip -vl will let you see the compression of each file
Feb 23 15:53:44 <Khaytsus>	cool.  This is the most I've used zip in like 20 years.
Feb 23 15:53:47 <Khaytsus>	feels ike 1995
Feb 23 15:54:38 <bwjr>	unzip -vl shows the first item is a directory
Feb 23 15:54:49 <phogg>	bwjr: based what Khaytsus discovered, the *first* file in the archive controls what file will report for the whole archive. This is inaccurate. unzip -vl will let you see the reality. Is your *first* file one on zip's do-not-deflate-b-default list?
Feb 23 15:55:06 <Khaytsus>	bwjr: Compare the contents, perhaps you added stuff to the zip you didn't realize
Feb 23 15:55:12 <phogg>	bwjr: a directory can't be compressed, so store makes sense for that. That's confusing file.
Feb 23 15:55:37 <Khaytsus>	I've done that before, existing zip file, just added to it instead of creating a new one
Feb 23 15:56:13 <phogg>	Khaytsus: try file -k on it?
Feb 23 15:56:43 <phogg>	maybe if you tell file to keep trying it will look further into the zip... maybe not, you'd need a different bit of magic for it
Feb 23 15:56:50 <Khaytsus>	compression method=store\012- data
Feb 23 15:58:20 <phogg>	yep, doesn't seem to matter. The report from file is just not very accurate.
Feb 23 15:58:40 <bwjr>	yes it appears that it's zipping in a different way from the original. There are 22 'files' in the original and '27 'files' in the new.
Feb 23 15:58:57 <phogg>	bwjr: are the missing files just directories?
Feb 23 15:59:06 <bwjr>	phogg: yes
Feb 23 15:59:11 <phogg>	bwjr: that makes sense
Feb 23 15:59:24 <silly>	fweht, i've configured htop to show temp and cpu clock in the bar https://ibb.co/kXvGFjN

Feb 23 16:07:14 <TuxJobs>	In the early 2000s, I saw a Linux computer at school which said nothing but "LI" or "li" as text on boot. I thought this was absurdly cryptic, but did that have something to do with the LILO bootloader and it displaying "LI" to indicate that it failed to load instead of just saying that? Or have I got that wrong?

Feb 23 16:35:33 <phogg>	bwjr: looks like a case of a broken zip file from Windows. The article I linked has a oneliner for fixing it.
Feb 23 16:35:40 <nullie>	akk: I don't know. As I remember VirtualBox used rather smart strategy if the emularted architecture is the same, but I guess qemu should do something similar
Feb 23 16:36:37 <rascul>	zeratul they can, but  https://libera.chat/guides/catalyst#only-be-opped-up-when-necessary
Feb 23 16:36:39 <korn3r>	virtualbox refused to start vm on this laptop complaining there is no hardware support, but it was on windows, maybe linux one can handle that.
Feb 23 16:37:09 <rzx6733>	virtualbox does not have a fallback to full cpu emulation, does it?
Feb 23 16:37:50 <nullie>	I think it replaces unsafe calls somehow
Feb 23 16:37:59 <nullie>	otherwise code runs natively
Feb 23 16:38:27 <nullie>	well I don't know if it can do full cpu emulation

Feb 23 16:40:46 <Fnerd>	hi
Feb 23 16:40:52 <akk>	Anybody know what controls whether /etc/default/keyboard applies to consoles?
Feb 23 16:41:08 <rzx6733>	nullie: qemu surely can. when the qemu project started, there were no virt features in the cpu. later qemu added kvm patches to make use of cpu virt.
Feb 23 16:41:18 <akk>	I have XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps" and it works under X, used to work in the console too but it just stopped working there.
Feb 23 16:43:07 <nullie>	rzx6733: yes it can translate the code. But can it leverage the fact that the host and target architectures are the same?
Feb 23 16:43:52 <rzx6733>	nullie: i think only if the cpu has the virt feature (vmx on intel, svm on amd).
Feb 23 16:44:25 <nullie>	though now I'm not sure that virtualbox or vmware is different in that aspect
Feb 23 16:55:32 <akk>	Ah, I think I figured out the keyboard thing, the console-setup package got uninstalled for some reason. (Won't know for sure til next reboot/login.)

Feb 23 17:15:32 <Inline>	wget -nc ?
Feb 23 17:15:45 <Inline>	for --no-clobber or --noclobber or so
Feb 23 17:16:21 <somenick>	-nc will cause the same file to download as filename.1, filename.2 etc....

Feb 23 17:20:24 <somenick>	https://linux.die.net/man/1/wget    then search for 'no-clobber'
Feb 23 17:24:44 <somenick>	jindam, another way is: -c or --continue option. Please read the manpage to understand if that is what you want.
Feb 23 17:26:22 <twainwek>	i have a vm with an interface in bridge mode. i can manually give the interface a static ip and connect to it, but it won't get an ip from dhcp. what can be causing this

Feb 23 17:28:12 <MacGyver>	twainwek: Too many things *can* be causing it; it would help if you explain why you expect it to get a DHCP address.

Feb 23 17:28:53 <twainwek>	MacGyver: i was thinking because its in bridge mode it would get an ip?

Feb 23 17:33:23 <rascul>	dhclient is probably available
Feb 23 17:33:25 <MacGyver>	twainwek: NetworkManager, usually.
Feb 23 17:33:31 <MacGyver>	twainwek: Not sure what NM uses under the hood.
Feb 23 17:34:58 <sigma1>	Hello
Feb 23 17:35:27 <twainwek>	i can seee that the vm is running systemd-networkd
Feb 23 17:35:37 <sigma1>	I don't understand here : https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xbindkeys If I want to set up the '+' key to increase volume what should I write in the ".xbindkeysrc" file?
Feb 23 17:36:20 <MacGyver>	twainwek: Then you probably need to write a .network file telling it to configure the interface with dhcp.
Feb 23 17:38:02 <twainwek>	damn
Feb 23 17:38:23 <rascul>	you don't have to use systemd-networkd though if you want to use something else
Feb 23 17:38:31 <cart_>	rzx6733: How do I use timeout though?

Feb 23 17:57:22 <MacGyver>	donofrio: It's for when you want to login with SSH keys instead of a password.
Feb 23 17:58:06 <rzx6733>	~/.ssh/authorized_keys is used to store the public part of a SSH key pair. then you can log in using the corresponding private key.

Feb 23 18:02:20 <rzx6733>	cart_: cron runs jobs as root. or do you mean user crontabs?
Feb 23 18:02:29 <cart_>	rzx6733: It is in this case. Its a system that just switches the screen on for 5 minutes and then shutsdown

Feb 23 18:05:13 <cart_>	rzx6733: So that left me wondering what my options are
Feb 23 18:05:33 <cart_>	Can I direct it to an already existing screen or X?
Feb 23 18:08:42 <rzx6733>	cart_: first of all, is it guaranteed an X session exists? if the machine just shows the graphical login (gdm, lightdm, ...) that it not a real X session.
Feb 23 18:09:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	gdm can be wayland these days
Feb 23 18:09:24 <rzx6733>	that too
Feb 23 18:10:35 <cart_>	rzx6733: I am basically guaranteed one will exist
Feb 23 18:10:47 <cart_>	Since there is a screen on it and always will be ...Intended anyway
Feb 23 18:11:07 <cart_>	But it can be switched off on sleep though
Feb 23 18:11:22 <rzx6733>	cart_: what is the machine used for?
Feb 23 18:13:30 <cart_>	rzx6733: It is a screen that displays some stats on certain hours of the day and for 10 minutes will be on and switch off after 10 minutes
Feb 23 18:13:42 <zeratul>	someone please tell me why the heck Linux just looooves to disable Num Lock ??

Feb 23 18:19:12 <cart_>	rzx6733: Ahh yea that is good idea.. cause the autorun is from the GUI right and it is aware of the current X or whatever display thing it is using
Feb 23 18:19:24 <rzx6733>	cart_: right
Feb 23 18:20:03 <cart_>	MacGyver: So I have a small ARM that is connected to a display. It needs to switch on every coupld of hours and run an app to update some things... The same app displays some stats and then quites after 10 minutes or so. It then puts the screen to sleep again
Feb 23 18:20:37 <Inline>	for t in /dev/tty[0-9]*; do setleds -D +num <$t; done
Feb 23 18:21:10 <MacGyver>	I hack my way around this in systemd user timers by putting DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY in my user's systemd environment and sourcing that in scripts that need the GUI.
Feb 23 18:21:43 <MacGyver>	But if this is something running as root, that won't do.

Feb 23 18:34:55 <rzx6733>	if the led is still blinking, it's alive. it the led is blinking with higher frequency, it is under heavy load.
Feb 23 18:35:36 <kfrench>	It changes frequency based upon load?  I ass-u-med it was a constant rate.
Feb 23 18:36:01 <rzx6733>	no, the heartbeat trigger is load dependent.

Feb 23 20:01:53 <SysGhost>	amdgpu ... is there a way to enforce display ports to always be enabled no matter if they're  connected or not? My old Rx580 is trying to be smart disabling all non-connected DP outputs hiding them completely. Thus xrandr cannot show any "disconnected" DP ports.
Feb 23 20:02:25 <rocks>	That sounds like a feature
Feb 23 20:02:56 <SysGhost>	I want to keep a port still around even if the screen is not connected. Otherwise the numbering messes up
Feb 23 20:03:14 <brjl>	The numbering? Why do you need the numbering?
Feb 23 20:03:27 <SysGhost>	some scripts I use.
Feb 23 20:03:32 <FlorianBad>	kfrench, yeah I just did and it works, but I wonder if I can trust it ;)
Feb 23 20:03:57 <rocks>	Updating the script to look at xrandr's output to get the port number would seem to be the solution
Feb 23 20:04:02 <SysGhost>	depend in the screens being on DP-1, DP-2 etc... But if I reboot the computer with my portable screen still not hooked up, the numbering is random
Feb 23 20:04:34 <SysGhost>	also another feature I want: to enable a virtual screen on DP-3
Feb 23 20:05:02 <SysGhost>	oth other non amd-gpu harware this works well as other hardware doesn't hide disconnected ports.
Feb 23 20:05:26 <rocks>	The old way to do this with Xorg was to configure CustomEDID so that it erports the desired monitor type as detected even if it's not there, or to configure a dummy monitor
Feb 23 20:05:45 <rocks>	No idea what you'd do with Wayland
Feb 23 20:06:10 <SysGhost>	I did try a dummy monitor. sadly it's not accelerated through the gpu thus ... not as desired
Feb 23 20:06:54 <SysGhost>	I am looking into having a dummy DP dongle to fool the port to be on but is a tad "fiddlier" when connecting/disconnecting my portable screen
Feb 23 20:07:29 <SysGhost>	the smartness makes it dumb... =P
Feb 23 20:08:12 <SysGhost>	CustomEDID coukld be the thing I'm looking for. Now... how to implement it?
Feb 23 20:08:23 <kfrench>	FlorianBad: Is it better to trust the source code that you're compiling, or the binary that comes with the same source code.
Feb 23 20:10:24 <kfrench>	The binary will be more thoroughly tested.  Since the package is not recent, but well known, and downloaded from a reasonably trusted source, it seems the precompiled is trustworthy enough, especially for a boot loader.
Feb 23 20:11:10 <kfrench>	I'm pretty sure I use that exact binary on my own bootable usb stick.
Feb 23 20:12:49 <SysGhost>	xorg "ConnectedMonitor" seems to be what I'm looking for. Sadly there's no wayland equivalent.
Feb 23 20:13:05 <rocks>	10 points to Gryffindor
Feb 23 20:13:09 <SysGhost>	Yet another reason for me to stay on good ol well proven X.org
Feb 23 20:15:01 <nhartman_>	Does the kernel expose access to any HW registers through sysfs or similar? Looking to correlate ARM cntpct_el0 register with current system time
Feb 23 20:15:16 <SysGhost>	*Hmmm* seems amdpgu ConnectedMonitor option doesn't use the same names as xrandr on the ports. How do I figure out the names on the port on this?
Feb 23 20:15:38 <rocks>	Look in the Xorg log
Feb 23 20:19:40 <SysGhost>	Ah... now this is odd. Xorg.0.log lists DisplayPort-0, DisplayPort-1, HDMI-A-0, HDMI-A-1, DVI-D-0 ... Yet the actual card has three display ports, one hdmi and and unpopulated DVI on the PCB
Feb 23 20:20:10 <SysGhost>	oh well... TIAS I guess
Feb 23 20:21:28 <SysGhost>	ooh I see what MSI did here. HDMI-A-0 is actually the third DP port.

Feb 23 20:35:19 <Aryan>	i used this, worked out.
Feb 23 20:35:41 <Inline>	yes aog
Feb 23 20:35:45 <hodapp>	did you build the kernel? if not, probably taking the word of whoever did
Feb 23 20:35:50 <Inline>	it's called forced module versioning in the kernel
Feb 23 20:35:53 <Inline>	you have to enable it
Feb 23 20:36:04 <bparker>	how do you know what they meant by legit
Feb 23 20:36:13 <Inline>	the modules have to be signed and you have to have the keys or at least the means to verify against it
Feb 23 20:36:20 <bparker>	wat
Feb 23 20:36:22 <aog>	by legit I mean that they are genuine kernel modules and not some bogus rootkit
Feb 23 20:36:29 <bparker>	aog: no
Feb 23 20:36:30 <bparker>	there isn't
Feb 23 20:36:35 <bparker>	unless you inspect every line of code
Feb 23 20:36:39 <ananke>	aog: you should look into ossec
Feb 23 20:36:47 <bparker>	I have no idea what Inline is on about with signing or whatever
Feb 23 20:36:54 <aog>	Inline, said they can be verified against a hash
Feb 23 20:37:24 <bparker>	again whatever he's talking about is with a heavily wrong assumption of what they meant
Feb 23 20:37:33 <ananke>	aog: specifically, ossec + https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/ruleset/index.html
Feb 23 20:37:34 <Inline>	well anyway, what i know is there's something in the kernel to sign modules
Feb 23 20:37:47 <Inline>	i don't know the specifics, who does the signing etc...
Feb 23 20:37:58 <bparker>	that doesn't protect against malicious code written by the module author (or their infected PC)
Feb 23 20:38:21 <Inline>	you won't get that even in normal distro kernels or ?
Feb 23 20:38:30 <bparker>	never heard of kernel module signing ever
Feb 23 20:38:37 <Inline>	only maybe enterprise servers
Feb 23 20:38:52 <Inline>	where you have to pay for the OS
Feb 23 20:39:47 <rascul>	modinfo can show the signature
Feb 23 20:40:05 <Inline>	right but who does the signing ?
Feb 23 20:40:11 <Inline>	is that a local signing ?
Feb 23 20:40:14 <rascul>	it lists the signer also
Feb 23 20:40:18 <Inline>	ah ok
Feb 23 20:40:19 <rascul>	try it:   modinfo ext4
Feb 23 20:40:19 <aog>	let's assume we trust the module author bparker, we just want to check that every module is signed and not some bogus rootkit
Feb 23 20:40:51 <hodapp>	if there's actually a rootkit it could interfere with the mechanism you use to check it

Feb 23 20:42:58 <ananke>	aog: you may want to investigate what current HIDS products can do
Feb 23 20:43:04 <aog>	ananke, do you run wazuh on your system?
Feb 23 20:43:15 <zgx2517>	module signing is most likely done by the distributor, after compiling the kernel
Feb 23 20:43:33 <ananke>	aog: no. at previous work we used to run ossec, in my current line we have a different workload
Feb 23 20:43:50 <aog>	on your personal machine what do you run?

Feb 23 20:45:42 <ananke>	it's not a risk I'm trying to mitigate
Feb 23 20:48:57 <bparker>	I guess I misunderstood what you meant by 'genuine' kernel module as well
Feb 23 20:49:30 <bparker>	and even 'not a rootkit' is ambiguous
Feb 23 20:50:42 <aog>	I see 247 ko installed on my system, the question arises how can I verify that none of these are not malicious, rewriting kernel calls, hiding processes and files, extracting data and sending it over the wire... etc.
Feb 23 20:50:44 <SysGhost>	Thanks everyone involved. I now use my portable screens in wireless mode (They can play video streams). Using it through a "fake" HDMI-A-0 connection. GPU accelerated and all. No longer using slow software dummy driver.
Feb 23 20:50:48 <jackal>	anyone uses skype?
Feb 23 20:50:48 <ananke>	aog: for example, I didn't realize wazuh was a fork of ossec. I imagine if I had to implement something now, I'd start with wazuh. generally speaking the concerns of rootkits are typically addressed via the use of NIDS/HIDS systems
Feb 23 20:52:06 <FlorianBad>	I'm having a problem getting a keyboard working in initrd (needed to type pwd for LUKS). I put all these modules in my initrd: https://florian.club/pub/20240223_114217.jpg and it does load them: https://florian.club/pub/20240223_114531.jpg but still no keyboard (caps lock doesn't light on)  My lsmod when keyboard works has all that: https://sprunge.us/CPmUkM
Feb 23 20:56:05 <aog>	understood, thank you guys

Feb 23 21:30:04 <neoncortex>	a website that totally breaks the keyboard letter k from the computer to the monitor, that appears in linux?
Feb 23 21:30:15 <hodapp>	they always ask me dumb interview questions, like "when should you use a binary tree?" and "code a solution to fizzbuzz on the whiteboard" and "what was the felony charge?"
Feb 23 21:30:30 <Eryn_FL>	like all the steps the system goes through when the key is pressed down..
Feb 23 21:30:50 <neoncortex>	Eryn_FL: oh, right, now it makes sense =D
Feb 23 21:31:41 <Eryn_FL>	ok
Feb 23 21:32:25 <neoncortex>	yeah, the hardest one is the felony charge xD
Feb 23 21:33:27 <jackal>	bparker, apparently not that lot of people :P

Feb 23 21:38:03 <jasassin>	i cannot find a single one on the internet
Feb 23 21:41:18 <Rock_Kickass>	geez is it really a $12k cpu?
Feb 23 21:45:27 <rocks>	Gotta get that frame rate yo
Feb 23 21:47:16 *	Rock_Kickass server has four Intel Xeon E5-4600
Feb 23 21:47:59 <neoncortex>	I can buy like two cars, and a bike with that money.  12k dollars here is a considerable amount.
Feb 23 21:49:00 <neoncortex>	almost can buy a home, depending where.
Feb 23 21:49:31 <Inline>	geez, i just now enabled firewall from within the VMs
Feb 23 21:49:41 <Inline>	and lapps stopped heating immediately

Feb 23 21:49:59 <rocks>	Take that, hackers!

Feb 23 22:07:53 <Inline>	in linux it's called
Feb 23 22:07:54 <Inline>	erm
Feb 23 22:08:00 <Inline>	not .net
Feb 23 22:08:22 <Inline>	it's mono
Feb 23 22:09:42 <Inline>	there's even basic, it's called gambas
Feb 23 22:09:48 <Inline>	for linux
Feb 23 22:09:50 <Inline>	lol
Feb 23 22:10:42 <CrouzinggV22>	Edgy Reckless Microshit software ?
Feb 23 22:10:54 <Crell>	Hi folks.  Seemingly obvious (or maybe dumb) question.  I'm trying to concat 2 lines to a file. I've tried both `cat "foo\bar\n" filename.txt` and `tee -a <<< "foo\nbar\n" >/dev/null filename.txt`.  In both cases, the \n isn't read as a newline and just put into the file literally.  Why?  Isn't that what double quoting is supposed to do,
Feb 23 22:10:55 <Crell>	respect escape characters?
Feb 23 22:10:57 <CrouzinggV22>	i heard mono
Feb 23 22:11:45 <Inline>	Crell, it's maybe your shells settings which affect that
Feb 23 22:12:10 <Crell>	It should be basic boring bash, I think?  It's a line in a script.
Feb 23 22:12:10 <Inline>	there's different shells and different settings, globbing, expanding, interpolation etc. etc...
Feb 23 22:12:49 <schroes>	.not
Feb 23 22:12:52 <schroes>	or shortly .!
Feb 23 22:14:42 <Crell>	How would I check/set whatever it is I need to to make \n get interpolated?
Feb 23 22:15:39 <schroes>	Crell: it could depend on a command: echo vs printf, and so on, also don't use single quotes
Feb 23 22:15:52 <Crell>	I am not using single quotes, I'm using double quotes.
Feb 23 22:15:54 <Crell>	As shown.
Feb 23 22:16:07 <Inline>	that's not single quotes
Feb 23 22:16:10 <Inline>	it's backticks
Feb 23 22:16:32 <Inline>	backticks are ok, they equivalent of $(), but also a little different
Feb 23 22:17:09 <Inline>	but i'm not sure on the rest of backticks
Feb 23 22:17:14 <CrouzinggV22>	243mb bloated mono downloading
Feb 23 22:17:17 <Inline>	like how expansion etc. is affected by it
Feb 23 22:17:28 <CrouzinggV22>	for typing hello world
Feb 23 22:17:57 <Inline>	congrats CrouzinggV22 maybe you spared 1G in comparison to java
Feb 23 22:18:03 <Inline>	lol
Feb 23 22:18:23 <CrouzinggV22>	ahh it didnt work still not accepts my bloat package
Feb 23 22:18:35 <Inline>	shave on and you may land in lisp some day too.....
Feb 23 22:18:49 <Inline>	hahaha
Feb 23 22:18:55 <CrouzinggV22>	solution that is, i can remove everything and install netbeans, but i wanna try gnome-builder so hard
Feb 23 22:21:21 <rascul>	Crell  tee -a <<< $'foo\nbar\n'
Feb 23 22:22:21 <CrouzinggV22>	it looks so s_xy :3 but not works
Feb 23 22:24:06 <CrouzinggV22>	there is c# support plugin written in pytho  wtfff xd

Start 'cat', the doc dumps the file /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon/3u ... however they don't give any explanation of how they chose 3u.  Can someone explain that??  it would seem to be "bus 3", however using their outline in section "2. Find which bus..."  it doesn't seem to be sufficient to ID the appropriate device
Feb 24 00:04:26 <BrokenCog>	they use in step 3??
Feb 24 00:05:26 <twainwek>	step 2 tells you the bus id
Feb 24 00:06:39 <twainwek>	is your question that you can have multiple devices on the same bus?
Feb 24 00:07:27 <BrokenCog>	so in step 2 they show an example of a device on bus 3, but in step 3 they don't show how they isolated that device on bus 3 ... that's the question.
Feb 24 00:09:07 <twainwek>	step 3 doesn't seem to say that they isolated a device, but rather a bus
Feb 24 00:09:34 <BrokenCog>	hmm ... just dumping all the devices ontha tbus.  okay, I guess I misread that.

Feb 24 01:40:21 <BlueSkies90>	Do Linux's system logs contain bash shell history (executed commands?)
Feb 24 01:41:05 <oerheks>	yes
Feb 24 01:41:43 <zen_desu>	what do you mean by "linux's system logs"
Feb 24 01:41:55 <zen_desu>	the kernel log?
Feb 24 01:42:02 <BlueSkies90>	So it's not just in ~/.bash_history? It's also copied to the system logs?
Feb 24 01:42:05 <zen_desu>	no that does not contain many executed commands
Feb 24 01:42:09 <oerheks>	type in terminal: history
Feb 24 01:42:14 <zen_desu>	not unless you go out if your way to do that
Feb 24 01:42:18 <oerheks>	not the sudo commands though
Feb 24 01:42:21 <zen_desu>	it may show sudo usage depending on the setup
Feb 24 01:42:29 <zen_desu>	well sudo commands may be logged
Feb 24 01:42:38 <zen_desu>	it really depends on how your system logging is setup
Feb 24 01:42:53 <BlueSkies90>	oerheks: I thought termina: history just reads from ~/.bash_history. Is the history in ~/.bash_history also copied/duplicated in the system logs?
Feb 24 01:42:58 <oerheks>	those are usually stored in /root/.bash_history
Feb 24 01:43:03 <BlueSkies90>	zen_desu: ah I see, ok thanks
Feb 24 01:44:32 <BlueSkies90>	oerheks: /.bash_history is not considered system logs though?
Feb 24 01:44:38 <zen_desu>	some logging utilities can read from files and just treat those as logs, you can potentially make it read from those and log to somewhere in /var/log
Feb 24 01:45:02 <zen_desu>	"system log" may refer to stuff in /var/log
Feb 24 01:45:08 <zen_desu>	or the kernel log
Feb 24 01:45:14 <oerheks>	indeed, user logs
Feb 24 01:45:14 <zen_desu>	it's kinda not really one thing
Feb 24 01:45:30 <zen_desu>	but what ends up there is up to you
Feb 24 01:45:52 <BlueSkies90>	oerheks: Then why did you say that system logs includes bash history earlier if ~/.bash_history is considered user logs?
Feb 24 01:46:05 <BlueSkies90>	zen_desu: I see. But in a typical set, what system logs usually refers to does NOT include bash_history right?
Feb 24 01:46:17 <oerheks>	switch to root; type history ..
Feb 24 01:46:37 <Namarrgon>	no, logs usually do not contain shell history
Feb 24 01:47:06 <oerheks>	oh, it should not reveal ..
Feb 24 01:47:30 <BlueSkies90>	Namarrgon: ok thanks!
Feb 24 01:47:39 <BlueSkies90>	oerheks: still a little confused about what you're saying
Feb 24 01:53:50 <Kingsy>	can someone explain the purpose of the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS var?
Feb 24 01:54:15 <rocks>	Is it the address of the DBus session bus perhaps?
Feb 24 01:54:59 <Kingsy>	well, mine gives me this DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-i7uePWiOTf,guid=927d2c683590f40d4bd1dfc865d93d88, but weirdly ls: cannot access '/tmp/dbus-i7uePWiOTf': No such file or directory <- this is not right... surely
Feb 24 01:55:37 <BlueSkies90>	oerheks: Are you saying that the syslogs contains root shell history (sudo history) but not non sudo history?
Feb 24 01:55:59 <RayTracer>	Kingsy: it's unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus here (on F39). A /tmp file might be deleted by some cleanup job
Feb 24 01:56:40 <Kingsy>	RayTracer: ok but if my current DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is pointing to a tmp dir that doesnt exist, that means dbus is broken no?
Feb 24 01:56:55 <rocks>	or maybe your dbus user instance exploded at some point and the old address is no longer correct
Feb 24 01:58:37 <RayTracer>	likely its broken, as new processes can't access it. However, old processes already having the fd could still work
Feb 24 01:59:03 <Kingsy>	darn, guix is certainly a strange OS.
Feb 24 02:00:21 <rocks>	But it respects your freedom!
Feb 24 02:01:46 <Kingsy>	hehe it certainly does
Feb 24 02:09:58 <jim>	what;s guix?
Feb 24 02:10:11 <Disconsented>	iirc nix but without systemd
Feb 24 02:10:12 <jim>	a linux dist?
Feb 24 02:10:15 <Disconsented>	yeah
Feb 24 02:10:24 <jim>	oh ok
Feb 24 02:10:50 <jim>	I was gonna reboot this thing... back in awhile
Feb 24 02:23:55 <jasassin>	anyone know what this is about?: E: Release file for http://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/unstable/InRelease is not valid yet (invalid for another 1h 12min 37s). Updates for this repository will not be applied.
Feb 24 02:24:08 <jasassin>	while trying to do an apt update in debian unstable
Feb 24 02:24:17 <jasassin>	it's like it's stuck in limbo
Feb 24 02:24:36 <Rock_Kickass>	s your time set correctly?
Feb 24 02:25:49 <jasassin>	just checked, looks good
Feb 24 02:27:16 <jasassin>	i dont even know what an InRelase file is, but i've seen it complain about not having one and still updating. this is a new one for me.
Feb 24 02:28:07 <jasassin>	maybe i could set my clock forward huh
Feb 24 02:29:56 <tusko>	I don't think the systemd thing is really going to go anywhere long-term.
Feb 24 02:32:58 <jasassin>	hah! pushing my clock forward fixed it
Feb 24 02:33:01 <jasassin>	man that is weird

Feb 24 02:42:25 <cappy>	And are you running NTP or chrony to sync?
Feb 24 02:51:03 <jasassin>	cappy: got it working, but thank you though!
Feb 24 02:51:26 <cappy>	jasassin: sure thing.
Feb 24 02:51:43 <Kingsy>	right, so its time for a distro hop. Been using debian for a long time, and will continue to do so for work, btu I need something for my laptop. Guix has been very painful so I am going to leave that alone, would be good to hear some suggestions, I know its a big discussion so not looking to rip on anyones choices, I am just curious
Feb 24 02:52:55 <cappy>	Kingsy: Mint Xfce DE should run well on your laptop and since you're used to Debian, easy pick-up.
Feb 24 02:54:10 <Kingsy>	sorry I should have mentioned, I want something minimal, I use stumpwm with xinit, so I don't need a DE, I have used mint a while back, it was ok, but yeah lokoing for super minimal really, something I can just build up
Feb 24 02:59:08 <cappy>	More minimal than LXLE or Linux Lite?
Feb 24 03:00:19 <cappy>	I came from Slackware and tried Porteus for a while. Slackware was very nuts & bolts.
Feb 24 03:01:02 <cappy>	They should still be on init, if you're looking to ditch systemd.
Feb 24 03:01:23 <Kingsy>	oh interesting, thanks
Feb 24 03:02:24 <cappy>	Porteus is Slackware based, which is why I gave it a shot.
Feb 24 03:03:29 <Rock_Kickass>	slackware is probably the "heaviest" distro there is shipping with half a dozen bootloaders 6 or 7 DE and multiple apps for every one thing
Feb 24 03:03:58 <louipc>	lol. i agree
Feb 24 03:04:03 <louipc>	pick one and stick with it
Feb 24 03:04:08 <Kingsy>	hahah
Feb 24 03:04:15 <Kingsy>	back to debian it is then
Feb 24 03:04:37 <louipc>	i think fedora i pretty focused
Feb 24 03:04:37 <ananke>	last time I checked, it was _three_ boot loaders. but hyperbole much
Feb 24 03:05:09 <Rock_Kickass>	more like syslinux lilo elilo grub thats 4
Feb 24 03:05:39 <cappy>	I left Slackware at 11.x and it was sans GUI and ran on the lowest POS system imaginable. I don't know where it went in the years since.
Feb 24 03:05:40 <louipc>	i guess the leet linux user expects a billion options
Feb 24 03:06:14 <ananke>	louipc: more like the maintainer can't let go off lilo
Feb 24 03:06:18 <louipc>	so some of these distros are not really an OS themselves, but a way to build a coherent OS
Feb 24 03:06:48 <louipc>	ananke: the boss of slackware?
Feb 24 03:06:54 <ananke>	louipc: yes
Feb 24 03:07:06 <cappy>	That POS system was a NECReady 330T and that should say something about how minimal Slackware 9 through 11 was.
Feb 24 03:07:12 <louipc>	why include all the other ones if he wants to promote lilo then
Feb 24 03:07:34 <ananke>	louipc: because lilo does not work on uefi
Feb 24 03:08:11 <cappy>	And aren't they one of the few left that still use LILO?
Feb 24 03:08:40 <ananke>	'they' being who?
Feb 24 03:08:47 <cappy>	Slackware
Feb 24 03:08:55 <louipc>	ananke: maybe they can just drop uefi support heueheuh
Feb 24 03:09:15 <louipc>	slackers be slackin
Feb 24 03:09:17 <ananke>	cappy: 'slackware' is singular. and likely yes
Feb 24 03:10:10 <louipc>	i think they just like to package lot of software
Feb 24 03:10:54 <ananke>	yes and no. slackware has a relatively small number of packages, but you need to install most of them to have a working system
Feb 24 03:11:10 <cappy>	Well, isn't their release cycle still a half-year or a year, or whenever Volkerding gets around to it?
Feb 24 03:11:30 <ananke>	cappy: the latter. whenever he feels like it
Feb 24 03:11:45 <cappy>	That's what it was; that's what it is.
Feb 24 03:14:24 <n4dir>	the little i hear from slackware it sure doesn't look like half-year, and not even once a year.
Feb 24 03:14:59 <n4dir>	that is: whenever i look, it is the same the last time i looked
Feb 24 03:15:23 <ananke>	it was never as frequent as a year
Feb 24 03:16:19 <cappy>	Yeah, and I still know people that swear by it, "Real programmers use Slackware," kinda thing. So security updates and important browser updates aren't important I guess.
Feb 24 03:16:41 <ananke>	cappy: it receives security updates.
Feb 24 03:16:46 <n4dir>	ananke: i ran version 14, and that is easily a decade ago, iirc, and now we have 15, running for 2 years, it seems
Feb 24 03:16:50 <ananke>	don't confuse security updates with release cycles
Feb 24 03:17:02 <cappy>	ananke: Point taken.
Feb 24 03:17:25 <n4dir>	cappy: i didn't mean that as a bad thing, i only said i don't see it like that, but as said, i don't really look too close
Feb 24 03:17:28 <n4dir>	i sure liked it
Feb 24 03:17:38 <ananke>	but, that's all you get: security updates. forget about bug fixes
Feb 24 03:18:31 <neoncortex>	depends where the bug is, and the severity.  Kernel bugs generally get patches.

Feb 24 12:31:45 <sphertext_>	you know how ppl use nginx as a reverse proxy that connects clients to a web app served for example by python's flask library? could socat be used in the same way as nginx in this scenario?
Feb 24 13:12:26 <TheChinaskiBoy>	hi all, I have two disks, 1 and 2, 1 has a running system and 2 is empty. I want to install another distro on disk 2. The installer seems to detect the bootloader in disk 1 and gives me the option to put the boot loader on the MBR of either 1 or 2. Since disk 1 is GPT-partitioned and should have an efi partition I was not expecting to see MBR at all. Is this just one of those anachronisms and I
Feb 24 13:12:28 <TheChinaskiBoy>	should be fine picking disk 1 anyway or will I do damage to the bootloader in disk 1?
Feb 24 13:13:53 <rv1sr>	Your EFI will either operate in "native" mode (searching for an ESP (EFI system partition) containing one or severat boot images, or in CSM (compat mode) where one MBR boot record is read
Feb 24 13:14:26 <rv1sr>	If you already have bootable system with EFI and an ESP, installing a bootloader to MBR will either brick your setup or do nothing at all
Feb 24 13:14:39 <rv1sr>	You need to add the second bootloader to the ESP as well
Feb 24 13:14:57 <rv1sr>	(Or alternatively make the first and existing bootloader aware of the second system)
Feb 24 13:17:09 <TheChinaskiBoy>	rv1sr: quick search tells me if /sys/firmware/efi exists I should be using native mode, is that right?
Feb 24 13:18:32 <rv1sr>	Yes, in particular /sys/firmware/efi/efivars (thats where a bootloader is referenced)
Feb 24 13:19:04 <robot5829>	What is the problem here anyway?
Feb 24 13:19:12 <rv1sr>	Most importantly for an installer to be able to palce its bootimage is the mount point /boot/efi (it must be the systems only ESP partition, FAT32)
Feb 24 13:19:20 <TheChinaskiBoy>	ok that exists, then I need to find out if the installer will do the right thing, or actually try to install to the mbr of disk 1?
Feb 24 13:19:41 <robot5829>	Are you decided to replace grub with systemd-boot or something?
Feb 24 13:20:06 <rv1sr>	robot5829: The second systems installer suggest installing an MBR while the first system is already using EFI
Feb 24 13:20:23 <TheChinaskiBoy>	no i wanted to keep booting from disk 1, existing grub
Feb 24 13:20:49 <rv1sr>	TheChinaskiBoy: You need to make sure the installer of the second system also has both paths mounted to be able to recognise an EFI system and set up its own boot image
Feb 24 13:21:44 <rv1sr>	You will in either case, EFI limits your setup to onw ESP per system overall (not per disk) so you will continue to boot from your first any only ESP
Feb 24 13:22:19 <rv1sr>	but you have the choice if you want to either keep 1 separate boot image per system (inside the same ESP) or to use one boot image (in your case grub) to boot into two different systems
Feb 24 13:22:42 <farkaan>	How should I go about running a script *only once* daily as long as the time is between a certain interval (say 7PM and 5AM)? I don't suppose cron is the right way to do this
Feb 24 13:23:10 <rv1sr>	On the latter case you can omit installing any additional bootloader and just reconfigure your existing grub to also list the second/new system
Feb 24 13:23:39 <rv1sr>	But by no means install anything related to MBR (as in your initial question)
Feb 24 13:24:41 <rv1sr>	farkaan: Systemd timer with Persistent=false
Feb 24 13:25:06 <farkaan>	rv1sr: yeah I knew the answer was probably systemd timers, i've never used them before but guess i'll look into them
Feb 24 13:28:04 <TheChinaskiBoy>	rv1sr: don't understand what you mean by boot image
Feb 24 13:28:50 <TheChinaskiBoy>	the existing esp is mounted to /boot/efi and I have a folder in /boot/efi/EFI for system 1, is that the boot image?
Feb 24 13:29:40 <TheChinaskiBoy>	or you mean grub vs something else?
Feb 24 13:39:04 <TheChinaskiBoy>	if in the installer I pick to install the bootloader in disk 2 (it's a menu, there's no option to not install it), and the installer isn't seeing the existing efi partition, will it potentially create another efi partition on disk 2 and place grub there too? what happens in that case?

Feb 24 14:15:22 <VecT0r_X>	nm you?
Feb 24 14:15:38 <VecT0r_X>	you play counterstrike?
Feb 24 14:15:58 <ski>	weren't you slacko64_14723 before ?
Feb 24 14:16:00 <scottpedia>	hello guys
Feb 24 14:16:09 <slacko64_20007>	is there any web crawler for linux?
Feb 24 14:16:17 <scottpedia>	slacko64_20007: yes httrack
Feb 24 14:16:29 <slacko64_20007>	how to use that?
Feb 24 14:16:38 <scottpedia>	slacko64_20007: you gotta figure out yourself
Feb 24 14:16:38 <llanhmock>	idk about counterstrike but mech arena is really fun and addictive.
Feb 24 14:17:02 <scottpedia>	slacko64_20007: the cli options are many
Feb 24 14:17:30 <scottpedia>	you have to take your time to try and learn the function of each option slacko64_20007
Feb 24 14:17:32 <slacko64_20007>	where can i get all the registered website urls?
Feb 24 14:17:56 <phogg>	slacko64_20007: registered for what?
Feb 24 14:18:04 <scottpedia>	slacko64_20007: i think there's an option at httrack that allows you do log only the linked websites' links
Feb 24 14:18:13 <scottpedia>	so you gotta start digging
Feb 24 14:19:06 <slacko64_20007>	ca u help me?
Feb 24 14:19:15 <scottpedia>	slacko64_20007: yeah sure
Feb 24 14:19:25 <scottpedia>	you wanna pm? slacko64_20007
Feb 24 14:19:36 *	nullvalue greets all
Feb 24 14:19:37 <slacko64_20007>	sure
Feb 24 14:21:19 <TuxJobs>	Genuine question for anyone running modern GNOME (not Classic/Flashback/MATE): How do you deal with not being able to minimize windows, not having a "taskbar" of any kind, and not having a "desktop" to work on with objects such as folders and files (only a wallpaper)?
Feb 24 14:21:32 <TuxJobs>	Does it really feel natural after some time?
Feb 24 14:21:53 *	xx uses Alt-Tab and keyboard shortcuts
Feb 24 14:22:32 *	phogg stopped using a desktop and taskbar in 1999
Feb 24 14:22:43 <phogg>	I also don't use GNOME at all, but when I did I never used those things
Feb 24 14:23:00 <nullvalue>	the frustration must be killing you - Prison Break
Feb 24 14:23:01 <beefd00r>	same I usually used ranger or simply the terminal to deal with files
Feb 24 14:24:10 <beefd00r>	TuxJobs: You switched to GNOME?
Feb 24 14:24:37 <phogg>	TuxJobs: my workflow is to have a large number of virtual desktops and to manage tasks by putting each on a different destkop. I don't iconify anything, and my wallpaper is always covered by open windows (so there's no point to pinning anything like icons to it). Alt+Tab through windows on the current viewport and using the pager to change which area a window is on are all the task management I need.
Feb 24 14:25:36 <phogg>	TuxJobs: I have not seriously used GNOME3, but I understand they have some kind of an expose-style thing for zooming out to see all open windows as icons and to jump to them.
Feb 24 14:26:39 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Feb 24 14:26:42 <phogg>	TuxJobs: all that said, if taskbar+desktop icons is how *you* feel comfortable working you should keep doing it. Pick a DE/WM that lets you set up your environment the way that makes sense to you, don't be concerned with what anyone else thinks is a good idea.
Feb 24 14:26:46 <luna_>	hey
Feb 24 14:26:52 <beefd00r>	Hello
Feb 24 14:27:47 <n4dir>	phogg: don't all DE's besides gnome have it kinda out of box?
Feb 24 14:28:20 <phogg>	n4dir: I don't know about all. KDE certainly can work that way, and it may be the default.
Feb 24 14:28:55 <nullvalue>	nice work flow phogg
Feb 24 14:29:16 <n4dir>	phogg: i forgot in which ones i ran the last years, always live-isos. As far i can tell all do it (and now i have to think about lxde/lxqt, which i didn't find on any of those isos)
Feb 24 14:29:32 <n4dir>	cinnamon, mate, xfce, enlightenment, kde for sure
Feb 24 14:29:50 <phogg>	n4dir: almost all will have a taskbar, but desktop icons are not a guarantee. However, you can always add a program that acts as a desktop to any DE/WM
Feb 24 14:30:26 <n4dir>	phogg: desktop icons, as far i can see, mainly are missing in WM's, not all though, but on DE they just seem to be there
Feb 24 14:30:42 <n4dir>	because i always have to find a way to disable them ...
Feb 24 14:30:59 <phogg>	the reason I mention both is because the line between "fat WM" and "DE" is more theoretical than real
Feb 24 14:31:13 <n4dir>	yup.
Feb 24 14:31:31 <phogg>	for example, GNUStep. DE? I would say so. Doesn't include a WM at all. Doesn't use desktop icons.
Feb 24 14:31:42 <phogg>	but it has the dock, which serves a similar purpose
Feb 24 14:31:45 <n4dir>	i see your point
Feb 24 14:32:07 <llanhmock>	i3 ftw
Feb 24 14:32:21 <n4dir>	i meant the more common ones, or rather: whatever i ran into. GNUStep i hardly remember exists
Feb 24 14:32:24 <beefd00r>	Yo GNUStep looks sick though lol
Feb 24 14:32:42 <n4dir>	say fvwm-crystal ... no clue how it is.
Feb 24 14:32:42 <phogg>	gnustep is not as popular as it should be, it is and has been a quite capable environment
Feb 24 14:33:18 <n4dir>	i sure used WindowMaker for a while. Not too bad
Feb 24 14:33:42 <phogg>	WindowMaker is nice. It has a good GUI config tool and supports a very wide array of management options.
Feb 24 14:33:59 <jasassin>	use i3 tiling window manager and get a pimped out desktop that looks like the norad comm center in war games
Feb 24 14:35:28 <beefd00r>	Anyone else in here who experienced strange I3 behavior? Like when you open one workspace, start the terminal, and it creates it in the previous workspace? Or when you move a window from one monitor to the other with shortcuts very quickly (it fucks up the ordering of the tiling windows)
Feb 24 14:36:34 <jasassin>	i've never used it before... i was just blowing smoke
Feb 24 14:36:54 <jasassin>	beefd00r: it just does it sometimes?
Feb 24 14:37:45 <phogg>	if I were to use a tiling wm it would probably be bspwm
Feb 24 14:38:08 <phogg>	a truly minimal WM that doesn't chuck a lot of unrelated junk into the WM itself
Feb 24 14:40:23 <llanhmock>	would be nice if their upstream page had in-usage visuals so I can see how it looks compared to my i3.
Feb 24 14:40:26 <jasassin>	have you ever heard of evilwm? it's like 64k
Feb 24 14:41:02 <llanhmock>	but, I doubt I'd be switching anytime soon.
Feb 24 14:41:08 <phogg>	my main trouble with WMs these days is lack of support for large desks. There's support in e16 but not e17, fvwm and twm have it, but metacity doesn't, kwin only via a plugin, zero tiling WMs I've seen allow it...
Feb 24 14:42:21 <phogg>	jasassin: the file size of the binary doesn't tell the whole minimalism story
Feb 24 14:42:58 <sbine>	i tried awesome WM before, loved it
Feb 24 14:43:05 <phogg>	llanhmock: which WM doesn't have screenshots?
Feb 24 14:43:25 <llanhmock>	phogg: bspwm was it?
Feb 24 14:44:22 <phogg>	llanhmock: screenshots are trivial to find, try https://github.com/cloakedcode/bspwm-conf
Feb 24 14:44:53 <jasassin>	what is large desks?
Feb 24 14:45:09 <llanhmock>	phogg: oh thanks. not much different from i3 really.
Feb 24 14:45:31 <llanhmock>	well, i don't have any window seperation but other than that, its pretty much the same.
Feb 24 14:45:31 <phogg>	jasassin: the *other* way to do virtual desktops (the popular one these days being "multiple desks"). You can also do both
Feb 24 14:45:44 <phogg>	llanhmock: that part is, as you would expect, configurable
Feb 24 14:45:50 <llanhmock>	phogg: right
Feb 24 14:46:31 <phogg>	jasassin: imagine you take a window and move it half off your screen to the right. Where is the half you can't see?
Feb 24 14:46:49 <phogg>	jasassin: if you switch to the next desk to the right it isn't there... but it's somewhere
Feb 24 14:47:23 <jasassin>	i see
Feb 24 14:47:26 <phogg>	jasassin: large desk mode is where you move the viewport *within* the first desk by changing the X position of the leftmost pixel on your screen by adding the width of your screen
Feb 24 14:47:51 <phogg>	jasassin: this changes what you can see, so now you see the *right* half of that window (which now appears to be sticking off the left of your screen)
Feb 24 14:48:06 <jasassin>	the desktop is larger than the viewport and the viewport scrolls with the mouse?
Feb 24 14:48:34 <jasassin>	err desktop is larger than screen resolution so it scrolls? is that it/
Feb 24 14:48:48 <phogg>	jasassin: you can do the same thing vertically as well, so what you have is a "large desk" that is a vertical or horiziontal strip, or a grid, some multiple of the width/height of your screen.
Feb 24 14:49:05 <phogg>	jasassin: this is in contrast to always having a desk sized equal to your screen size
Feb 24 14:49:42 <jasassin>	so you want a tile to do that larger than the tile itself desktop
Feb 24 14:49:52 <phogg>	jasassin: then, which area of your large desk you are seeing is controlled by changing your "view port" within it. Normally you change in even steps of screen-sized chunks, but some (e.g. twm) allow you to scroll freely within it.
Feb 24 14:50:11 <phogg>	jasassin: so in that way it feels like a video game: you have a large map, you are viewing one part, and you can move your view within it
Feb 24 14:50:20 <jasassin>	yeah, i totally get it now
Feb 24 14:50:41 <phogg>	jasassin: I really like the way it works, it allows me to map "where a window is" spatially in my head.
Feb 24 14:50:47 <phogg>	which really works for me
Feb 24 14:51:14 <ski>	phogg : "if you switch to the next desk to the right it isn't there" -- with some, it is
Feb 24 14:51:17 <phogg>	if you go from desk 1 to desk 2, the 2nd desk *also* has a large area and you can do it all again.
Feb 24 14:51:17 <jasassin>	i found it inefficient
Feb 24 14:51:44 <phogg>	ski: if it is, then you have large desk support and your desk number did not change, but your viewport moved and you are now looking at a new area
Feb 24 14:52:09 <jasassin>	i find it easier to have multiple desktops, but i usually just run a browser so it's not a big deal
Feb 24 14:52:21 <ski>	often there may be some window or taskbar thing replicated to each desktop, though
Feb 24 14:52:24 <phogg>	jasassin: the best option is to support both.
Feb 24 14:52:30 <jasassin>	definitely
Feb 24 14:52:51 <phogg>	ski: that's pinning. In large desk mode it moves the window with the viewport
Feb 24 14:53:03 <ski>	"and your desk number did not change" -- well, it did
Feb 24 14:53:13 <phogg>	ski: did it? What does xprop of the root window say?
Feb 24 14:53:32 <ski>	it's a long time since i used a WM with this
Feb 24 14:54:00 <phogg>	ski: next time your do insepect _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP
Feb 24 14:54:13 <ski>	mhm

Feb 24 14:56:21 <beefd00r>	One day I will take a look at the logs but so far I just wanted to see if anybody has ever experienced the same bug as me
Feb 24 15:01:23 <rv1sr>	TheChinaskiBoy: Yes, a "boot image" in this case is a EFI executable spaced on the ESP. In my case grub (for example) is located in /boot/efi/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi
Feb 24 15:02:05 <rv1sr>	As the ESP (EFI system partition) is just a FAT volume, you need to reference them by entry in the system's efivars (/sys/firmware/efi/efivars mentioned earlier)
Feb 24 15:02:42 <rv1sr>	Whenever a new bootloader wants to register itself, it needs to place the binary on the ESP and create an entry in the efivars (specifying at least its name and path)
Feb 24 15:03:20 <rv1sr>	Multiple ESP are undefined behaviour, most likely the system will stop search for additional ESPs after encountering the first one
Feb 24 15:07:58 <TheChinaskiBoy>	rv1sr: thanks

Feb 24 15:46:41 <sazawal>	Hi all. I am trying to write a udev rule to execute a script when a usb connects. It works fine when my script is in my /home/user directories. But the script fails to execute when it is in /usr/bin. The script is working when I execute it from the terminal. How to fix it?
Feb 24 15:48:30 <vlt>	sazawal: Have a look at what specifically “fails”, fix that.
Feb 24 15:49:33 <sazawal>	vlt How do I find the logs for it?
Feb 24 15:50:40 <vlt>	sazawal: Where you created them. When we know more about that script and what “fails” means, we might be able to help better.
Feb 24 15:51:59 <sazawal>	I don't think there is an issue with the script. The script works fine when I run it from the terminal. How do I find logs of udev triggers, why is it not reaching the script path I provided in RUN+=
Feb 24 15:52:07 <sazawal>	vlt
Feb 24 15:53:19 <vlt>	sazawal: Hw do you know it is not reaching the script path?
Feb 24 15:54:05 <sazawal>	vlt, Because the script is not doing what it is supposed to do.
Feb 24 15:54:48 <sazawal>	vlt Alright, let me do another test.
Feb 24 16:09:24 <sazawal>	vlt So I figured out that the script is executing. But I am running a python script from inside the bash script and that is not executing. How do I troubleshoot the problem?

Feb 24 16:30:01 <phogg>	sazawal: then it is possibly a user-specific rather than environ-specific problem
Feb 24 16:30:03 <korn3r>	Khaytsus: xx: Thanks

Feb 24 16:30:36 <phogg>	(if it works, that is)
Feb 24 16:30:46 <sazawal>	phogg, See the problem is with triggering of the python script. If it was triggering and the problem was X or DISPLAY, then I would have got a log of "python script started" in a text file

Feb 24 16:32:20 <sazawal>	phogg, it is not one script. It is a library. What I am doing to test is I have put a line just at the start of the python entry script to write "python script started" in a file.
Feb 24 16:32:43 <phogg>	sazawal: I don't care what it is, it doesn't matter.
Feb 24 16:32:47 <sazawal>	phogg How do I get a clean environment to run it?

Feb 24 16:39:22 <Cold_Cat>	thanx phogg
Feb 24 16:39:51 <sazawal30>	What I can try is putting a sample python script in the bash script and see if it works.
Feb 24 16:39:54 <execrate>	Hello everyone, i am looking to make my own linux module but i have a problem. I want to list mount points on your system. I have a tone of errors with this: list_for_each_entry(mnt, &current->nsproxy->mnt_ns->mounts.rb_node, mnt_list). Anyone know why and how to fix it ?
Feb 24 16:40:06 <rascul>	sazawal30 did you check journal for information?
Feb 24 16:40:28 <sazawal30>	rascul, No how do I do it? journalctl?
Feb 24 16:40:31 <rascul>	journalctl -u systemd-udevd
Feb 24 16:40:37 <sazawal30>	Okay
Feb 24 16:40:37 <jim>	execrate, what kind of module?
Feb 24 16:40:59 <rascul>	if something isn't logged about it then udev logging verbosity can be increased and maybe it'll show up
Feb 24 16:41:30 *	Khaytsus sets ban on eash!*@*
Feb 24 16:41:32 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 24 16:41:33 *	litharge has kicked eash from #linux (Discuss your ban in #linux-ops.)
Feb 24 16:41:36 <rascul>	set to info or maybe debug to get more in the log:     udevadm control --log-level=info
Feb 24 16:41:44 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 24 16:41:59 <execrate>	jim Just a kernel module on 6.8.8 rc5 that create a proc file who everyone can read and it return mount points list
Feb 24 16:43:27 <jim>	a -kernel- module. ok, so this module would execute in kernel mode? space? and would have to be coded with the same kind of coding as other kernel code
Feb 24 16:44:43 <execrate>	i dont know i made it in c using module_init and insmod on the ko file
Feb 24 16:45:14 <jim>	you could also consider other ways, like a bash script or python script (to start with)
Feb 24 16:45:31 <sazawal30>	rascul, I see some failed messages in journalctl `Feb 24 16:15:16 archlinux (udev-worker)[933675]: 3-7.1.2.2: Process '/usr/bin/switcher_test' failed with exit code 1.` But this is half an hour ago, maybe I was testing something that time. There is no error after that and this error doesn't say much
Feb 24 16:46:05 <sazawal30>	rascul, Does udevadm monitor show the script errors?
Feb 24 16:46:11 <execrate>	jim I just want to learn to make linux kernel module on an linux next. Do you know how why my line dont work ?
Feb 24 16:46:55 <execrate>	To help, linux change the struct mnt_namespace and this is why i have trouble
Feb 24 16:47:06 <jim>	you might start by writing a .c file that gets the mount points and return a list of them]
Feb 24 16:47:36 <jim>	after that worry about making the kernel happy
Feb 24 16:48:22 <execrate>	i want to use kernel things like superblock. I cant do it in a simple c, no ?
Feb 24 16:48:45 <xx>	do it in rust
Feb 24 16:48:46 *	xx hides
Feb 24 16:48:50 <jim>	probably not
Feb 24 16:48:51 <execrate>	xD
Feb 24 16:49:08 <jim>	that's actually an idea
Feb 24 16:49:24 <xx>	they do accept rust code into the kernel now, might be simpler
Feb 24 16:49:29 <execrate>	Cause i know how to do it in c, its just with a linux kernel that i have trouble
Feb 24 16:50:03 <jim>	lacroix, rootbeer!
Feb 24 16:50:28 <execrate>	Does someone know how to use struct rb_rootmounts; from the struct mnt_namespace ?
Feb 24 16:50:48 <execrate>	sorry for bad spacing
Feb 24 16:51:03 <xx>	execrate: there's #kernel
Feb 24 16:51:13 <execrate>	i have to ask there ?
Feb 24 16:51:16 <execrate>	ok sorry then
Feb 24 16:51:20 <xx>	you can ask here
Feb 24 16:51:27 <xx>	but over there they might know the answer
Feb 24 16:51:40 <execrate>	i will try, thx xx :D
Feb 24 16:51:45 <execrate>	and thx jim
Feb 24 16:52:13 <execrate>	This channel is just for gnu/linux distro ?
Feb 24 16:52:15 <jim>	execrate, he's just thinking of where else to ask, to give you a better chance of getting what you need
Feb 24 16:52:38 <jim>	execrate, yeah kinda
Feb 24 16:52:58 <execrate>	yea, it is also a good idea to go to kernel
Feb 24 16:53:12 <execrate>	okkk i will no the next time
Feb 24 16:53:19 <execrate>	know*
Feb 24 16:53:41 <jim>	execrate, no worries
Feb 24 16:57:37 <ioria>	i don't see a rb_rootmounts struct in  mnt_namespace struct; maybe 'iam missing something
Feb 24 16:57:57 <rascul>	sazawal30 hrm, not sure if monitor will show the errors, you can try though
Feb 24 16:59:47 <sazawal30>	rascul, It's not showing errors. I did the `udevadm control --log-level=debug` . How do I see the errors now?
Feb 24 17:02:13 <rascul>	journalctl
Feb 24 17:11:50 <sazawal30>	rascul, Okay so there is an error in the import of one of modules in the python script. See https://pastes.io/ykdan3xbba
Feb 24 17:13:35 <sazawal30>	It has something to do with the os module in python. I wanted to get a path of the ~/.config folder in python. This I am getting with the os module in python. Can't say why it is not working.
Feb 24 17:14:30 <rascul>	sazawal30 you're using os.getlogin() which requires a controlling terminal but running it with udev does not have a controlling terminal
Feb 24 17:15:31 <sazawal30>	rascul, Ahh I see. With os.getlogin() I was getting the username of the executer. And from the username I was getting the /home/username/.config folder
Feb 24 17:16:19 <sazawal30>	I could have aavoided it by using pathlib.Path.home()/".config" but this doesn't work when you are a root user. It gives /root/.config instead.
Feb 24 17:17:01 <rascul>	what should it give?
Feb 24 17:17:33 <sazawal30>	I need the path of the /home/username/.config folder because I am storing a config file there.
Feb 24 17:18:17 <rascul>	bad practice to use a user's config when not running as that user
Feb 24 17:18:46 <rascul>	perhaps put a config in /etc and use that
Feb 24 17:19:10 <rascul>	or even /usr/local/etc if you're that kind of person
Feb 24 17:19:28 <sazawal30>	rascul, I see. Okay so I create a folder /etc/name_of_my_app and place the config file in there?
Feb 24 17:19:35 <rascul>	sure
Feb 24 17:19:59 <sazawal30>	That would mean whenever I am changing the config, I have to run the app as root.
Feb 24 17:20:12 <rascul>	aren't you already running it as root?
Feb 24 17:21:14 <sazawal30>	rascul Not always. Whenever I have to set or get a config I run as a normal user. I run as a root user when I have to create a udev rule for a usb_device because that means writing to a file in /etc/udev.
Feb 24 17:22:31 <rascul>	chown user /etc/your_config
Feb 24 17:23:17 <sazawal30>	rascul, Is it a normal practice to do so?
Feb 24 17:23:59 <rascul>	you probably have non-root things in /etc right now
Feb 24 17:24:49 <sazawal30>	rascul I see. So it is normal to do so.
Feb 24 17:25:03 <sazawal30>	Thanks a lot, I know where the issue is.
Feb 24 17:25:11 <rascul>	i don't know how normal it is but it's done
Feb 24 17:25:31 <sazawal30>	Okay
Feb 24 17:25:54 <jim>	as you've seen, chown must be run as root
Feb 24 17:26:09 <sazawal30>	jim Yes

Feb 24 17:28:27 <sazawal30>	Not that I need a separate one for each user. I am the only user of my pc. Just trying to understand.
Feb 24 17:29:02 <rascul>	you can have a separate config
Feb 24 17:29:25 <rascul>	it's common enough to check /etc for config then check ~ for config and override /etc stuff with ~ stuff
Feb 24 17:29:39 <rascul>	or just not use the /etc config if the ~ config exists
Feb 24 17:30:45 <sazawal30>	rascul But there is nothing like a particular user for udev right? It cannot find out for which user the script is being called.
Feb 24 17:31:03 <rascul>	it's root
Feb 24 17:31:14 <rascul>	you can find out just not with os.getlogin()

Feb 24 17:31:33 <sazawal30>	How do I find it out?
Feb 24 17:31:40 <rascul>	an alternative is mentioned
Feb 24 17:33:59 <sazawal30>	rascul, Can you tell me some keywords to google? I tried something like 'How to find the username when python script is run as root/sudo'
Feb 24 17:34:20 <rascul>	is the python docs i linked to not enough?
Feb 24 17:34:38 <sazawal30>	Oh sorry I missed it. I will check. Thanks
Feb 24 17:38:40 <bombastick>	my speed from my home ISP to my server on another continent just tanked. Using traceroute it shows the link between SG and JP is super slow. How can I tell if something happened? Is there a site where they post news about incidents to internet cables or something?
Feb 24 17:38:53 <bombastick>	and by "just tanked" I mean for the past several hours
Feb 24 17:40:40 <koollman>	bombastick: could be some after-effect of ntt-cogent troubles. Could be something else, of course. It's hard to get a general view, you could look for local network operator mailing lists
Feb 24 17:41:11 <Khaytsus>	There used to be some site that did analysis of all of the major backbones and talking to each other
Feb 24 17:41:47 <Khaytsus>	http://www.internettrafficreport.com/ maybe
Feb 24 17:42:42 <Khaytsus>	Oof, that says last updated 2018 lol
Feb 24 17:43:35 <Khaytsus>	https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/ looks interesting
Feb 24 17:43:53 <bombastick>	koollman: ah, interesting about NTT Cogent
Feb 24 17:47:24 <Khaytsus>	I've thought about setting up a ping to each major backbone in smokeping so I can see if my ISP is having any issues talking to anyone else..  sometimes about 7/8pm there's randomly latency and I've heard people say game ping times go up etc, but they don't necessarily have any idea where that slowdown is actually happening.
Feb 24 17:47:56 <Khaytsus>	Like poeple who blame "their wifi" for a website being down, or "the internet" when their wifi isn't set up right
Feb 24 17:48:13 <TuxJobs>	beefd00r: No, I didn't switch to GNOME. I just wanted to hear how people can possibly use it since it throws away all the basic, fundamental components of a GUI.
Feb 24 17:48:21 <koollman>	I don't have for each major backbone, but I do have some 'common' targets in smokeping. it sometimes help (a lot)
Feb 24 17:48:56 <beefd00r>	TuxJobs: Fair enough
Feb 24 17:49:21 <TuxJobs>	phogg: You said that you stopped using a desktop and taskbar in 1999. Why back then when even GNOME still had these concepts?
Feb 24 17:49:32 <beefd00r>	TuxJobs: Did you manage to solve the issue you had yesterday?
Feb 24 17:49:39 <Khaytsus>	koollman: Yeah, I have a few endpoints.. one across my country, a few in other countries.  But "one in each backbone" would be interesting
Feb 24 17:49:55 *	Khaytsus removes channel operator status from Khaytsus
Feb 24 17:51:12 <koollman>	what I have that is rather nice is endpoints using different isp that also setup smokeping in the same way. makes it nice to compare "access to my services from isp X" vs "access to google from isp X" for example. if both are bad, it's not my network having a problem :)
Feb 24 17:51:49 <TuxJobs>	phogg: "Pick a DE/WM that lets you set up your environment the way that makes sense to you" <-- I wish it were possible. Plasma is the closest, but horribly broken on my machine at least. I have hope that switching GPUs (paying for a new one) to AMD/Intel instead of NVIDIA will fix it, but even if it does, it really angers me that the Plasma desktop depends on the GPU whereas Dolphin does not. And the KDE developers' attitude in general. But all the others
Feb 24 17:51:49 <TuxJobs>	are far worse or have some extremely serious issue. So it's not a choice at all for me. Same thing with how Debian is the only plausible distro from my point of view, but I still don't *like* it.
Feb 24 17:52:35 <Khaytsus>	TuxJobs: Everything you use is "horribly broken"
Feb 24 17:52:58 <TuxJobs>	beefd00r: Do you mean my systemd problem? No. I eventually had to give up and simply not try to use it (for my own application), instead using Plasma's autostart login script feature to specify the command (which worked instantly).
Feb 24 17:53:22 <TuxJobs>	Khaytsus: How is that my fault?
Feb 24 17:53:40 <Khaytsus>	Been married nine times? Hell, maybe it's you.
Feb 24 17:58:38 <beefd00r>	TuxJobs: "autostart login script feature" you mean the feature I linked you to?
Feb 24 17:58:47 <beefd00r>	In any case I'm glad you had your issue solved
Feb 24 18:02:27 <TuxJobs>	beefd00r: Was that you? Yes. I think I explained what I did yesterday, though?
Feb 24 18:02:41 <TuxJobs>	Khaytsus: What do you mean by "maybe it's you"?
Feb 24 18:02:51 <TuxJobs>	Question: How come the "textmode terminals" (F1-F6 + Ctrl + Alt) neither seem to support TrueColor nor emojis? Also, the resolution seems very "off" and ugly while in that mode. Can't it simply use 1920 x 1080 pixels but text mode, with beautiful and smooth text and full Unicode/color support? Like when I run XTerm in the GUI mode but have entered fullscreen?

Feb 24 18:04:56 <TuxJobs>	(Also, at the eight divorce, didn't it feel silly? But I assume that was a joke.)
Feb 24 18:04:57 <hexnewbie>	TuxJobs: The virtual consoles are last resort, and not for real day-to-day use (though some folks still use them successfully in that manner), and are not seeing maintenance in some regards. TrueColor glyphs are impossible in a mode that supports true text mode.
Feb 24 18:05:28 <TuxJobs>	hexnewbie: I noticed that somebody in here seemed to not use a DE at all and just the text mode.
Feb 24 18:05:42 <hexnewbie>	That is, they are seeing maintenance as far as they are available if all else fails, but are more likely to lose features (see scrollback) than gain any
Feb 24 18:06:37 <hexnewbie>	At one point that lost the ability to enter a passphrase longer than 126 characters, but to be fair, that was a regression not feature loss
Feb 24 18:09:11 <hexnewbie>	TuxJobs: You can run a full graphical terminal without any DE (probably need a minimal WM akin to matchbox to have the terminal properly fullscreened, unless it's a framebuffer terminal), and without relying on the virtual consoles
Feb 24 18:09:23 <MacGyver>	TuxJobs: While hexnewbie is right, the virtual consoles can *absolutely* run in higher resolutions.
Feb 24 18:09:48 <hexnewbie>	Oh yeah, mine are 3840x2160
Feb 24 18:10:02 <MacGyver>	To the extent where the letters become too small, even.
Feb 24 18:10:19 <hexnewbie>	And since I'm using the same VGA font I set up in Debian 7 on a 1024x768 screen, I can't read anything ;p
Feb 24 18:10:28 <MacGyver>	^_^
Feb 24 18:10:50 <MacGyver>	hexnewbie: At least with a magnifying glass, the loss of scrollback might not bother you as much then :P
Feb 24 18:11:19 <scofi>	SWITCH OFF CHAT AI (ROBOT TALK)
Feb 24 18:11:42 <Khaytsus>	scofi: What?
Feb 24 18:11:54 <hexnewbie>	I've only seen lower-resolution VCs on NVIDIA cards using official NVIDIA drivers (do not know if they still do that)
Feb 24 18:12:17 <MacGyver>	hexnewbie: I think it depends how soon the machine starts using modesetting.
Feb 24 18:13:31 <MacGyver>	Iirc when I didn't have the KMS hook in my initcpio generation, the VTs would stay on 800x600.
Feb 24 18:20:15 <rascul>	my virtual console is 1920x1080 here
Feb 24 18:20:25 <rascul>	measured in beers
Feb 24 18:22:57 <beefd00r>	TuxJobs: "I think I explained what I did yesterday" Uhh I don't remember, probably because I left after sending you that link but yaa

Feb 24 18:41:37 <bparker>	hi
Feb 24 18:43:44 <rawhide>	luna_, how is that on topic?
Feb 24 18:43:55 <bparker>	lol
Feb 24 18:44:03 <buraq>	what's the topic?
Feb 24 18:44:44 <buraq>	i wanted to get out of discord/matrix so now i'm here
Feb 24 18:45:26 <preach>	...
Feb 24 18:48:07 <ayecee>	the /topic command shows some topic text for the channel.
Feb 24 18:48:46 <buraq>	i'm in the right place then!
Feb 24 18:49:29 <ayecee>	whew
Feb 24 18:49:59 <Inline>	sup sup
Feb 24 18:50:54 <buraq>	what's the latest hot topic?
Feb 24 18:51:21 <Inline>	hot meals
Feb 24 18:51:31 <Inline>	lol
Feb 24 18:52:06 <superkuh>	Gtk3/4 prioritizing keyboard inputs (because GNOME doesn't need them) and letting them bitrot and for bugs.
Feb 24 18:52:16 <superkuh>	ER, deprioritizing.
Feb 24 18:52:35 <superkuh>	"and form bugs" (I sure am a good typer)
Feb 24 18:53:06 <buraq>	i've learned to check my typing before i press enter
Feb 24 18:53:18 <avu>	a supercow is still just a cow after all
Feb 24 18:54:09 <ayecee>	superman isn't a man though.
Feb 24 18:54:20 <ayecee>	but.. an alien!!
Feb 24 18:54:42 <avu>	it's different with cows. Trust me, I'm an engineer.
Feb 24 18:54:44 <Inline>	yeah the horns are the same
Feb 24 18:54:49 <ayecee>	makes sense
Feb 24 18:54:50 <Inline>	lol
Feb 24 18:57:19 <buraq>	i'm confused. cows?
Feb 24 18:58:06 <ayecee>	sure. you've seen cows before, right?
Feb 24 18:58:08 <rascul>	cow horns are not the same
Feb 24 18:58:26 <buraq>	are they like linux cows?
Feb 24 18:58:34 <rascul>	each cow has two unique and beautiful horns
Feb 24 18:58:54 <ayecee>	yes indeed, linux cows are super cows
Feb 24 18:59:01 <buraq>	gotcha
Feb 24 18:59:06 <rascul>	super cows are just bulls
Feb 24 18:59:17 <buraq>	they have big balls
Feb 24 18:59:27 <rascul>	last bull we had at the farm would wear the hay ring as a hat sometimes
Feb 24 18:59:43 <rascul>	he was special
Feb 24 19:00:06 <Rock_Kickass>	i was down in the milking parlor pit and a bull came in one time
Feb 24 19:00:14 <ayecee>	buraq: little joke. apt-get has super cow powers. apt-get moo to reveal them.
Feb 24 19:00:46 <superkuh>	It is known.
Feb 24 19:00:55 <buraq>	i use fedora 38 it has no super powers
Feb 24 19:01:01 <ayecee>	indeed it does not.
Feb 24 19:01:12 <ayecee>	not super cow powers at least.
Feb 24 19:01:29 <n4dir>	aren't zombie cows a thing?
Feb 24 19:01:36 *	Khaytsus blinks
Feb 24 19:01:38 <ayecee>	are zombie cows a thing?
Feb 24 19:01:48 <superkuh>	It is actually just coincidence that I use debian linux now and my nickname is superkuh. I came up with it as a child before I ever started using linux or new of apt.
Feb 24 19:01:51 <Rock_Kickass>	remember the cow level in diablo?
Feb 24 19:01:53 <n4dir>	ayecee: i think they occur in a movie, but i confuse things all the time.
Feb 24 19:02:03 <superkuh>	knew.
Feb 24 19:02:05 <zanoh>	What about that silly cow level?
Feb 24 19:02:06 <ayecee>	well zombies are a thing, and cows are a thing
Feb 24 19:02:13 <ayecee>	so probably zombie cows are a thing
Feb 24 19:02:33 <ayecee>	cross product, matrix multiplication, etc.
Feb 24 19:02:47 <n4dir>	and yet he claimed no cows on fedora: https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/fedora-beta-release-for-version-18-now-available
Feb 24 19:03:11 <Khaytsus>	What the heck is even going on here
Feb 24 19:03:11 <zanoh>	My dad had a redhat (8?) installation way back in the late 90s. I can remember some game it came with that looked similar to diablo. Can't remember it.
Feb 24 19:03:16 <ayecee>	what's the tl;dr? probably not gonna click.
Feb 24 19:03:48 <ayecee>	zanoh: maybe it was diablo
Feb 24 19:06:30 <ayecee>	what do you think, is tl;dr too jargony? would it be better to say, what's the gist?
Feb 24 19:07:21 <n4dir>	no clue what the tl;dr is
Feb 24 19:07:30 <n4dir>	do i have to answer something?
Feb 24 19:08:19 <buraq>	the answer to life and everything
Feb 24 19:08:22 <ayecee>	confirmed, too jargony. tl;dr is "too long, didn't read", and often comes with a brief summary for those who didn't want to read the whole whatever.
Feb 24 19:08:51 <zanoh>	MIT license is the TL;DR for the GPLv3 :P
Feb 24 19:09:07 <ayecee>	like if you make a long post, and at the bottom, sum it up as "TL;DR many linux problems can be solved with peanut butter"
Feb 24 19:09:25 <n4dir>	ayecee: that i know, i meant if you mean the redhead link or someone else
Feb 24 19:09:31 <zanoh>	Nobody reads the ToS, ever. They deliberately make it as long and cryptic as possible on purpose.
Feb 24 19:10:03 <icy_hot>	can confirm. i've solved a lot of my linux issues while eating from a jar of peanut butter
Feb 24 19:10:08 <ayecee>	n4dir: i meant the redhat link, yes, but not that it was literally too long.
Feb 24 19:10:41 <ayecee>	more like, can i get a summary of how this link relates to the conversation
Feb 24 19:10:41 <n4dir>	ayecee: just claims one fedora release has the name "cow" in it.
Feb 24 19:10:49 <n4dir>	nothing worth thinking about
Feb 24 19:11:11 <ayecee>	ok. that's kinda why i asked, so i don't click on it and get a big disappoint.
Feb 24 19:11:23 <vycka>	rawhide
Feb 24 19:11:25 <n4dir>	yeah, i should have just copy/paste the headline. My fault
Feb 24 19:11:40 <n4dir>	jokes you have to explain seldom are funny ...
Feb 24 19:11:42 <ayecee>	eh. your own summary would be better.
Feb 24 19:11:53 <zanoh>	n4dir, unless explaining the joke is the actual joke.
Feb 24 19:12:04 <n4dir>	i mean, if the super-cow-power is a debian thing, i bet you somewhere find it in fedora
Feb 24 19:12:09 <ayecee>	that's some deep meta humor there.
Feb 24 19:12:19 <zanoh>	I could have sworn this super-cow-power was part of gentoo as well.
Feb 24 19:12:20 <n4dir>	zanoh is a philosopher
Feb 24 19:12:43 <ayecee>	i'm sure cows with powers is not a concept exclusive to debian.
Feb 24 19:13:49 <ayecee>	i wonder how old the cowsay program is.

Feb 25 02:09:50 *	Topic for #linux set by Khaytsus (Thu Aug  3 13:54:32 2023)
Feb 25 02:10:01 <n4dir>	oh, we talking about installation size on the harddisk?
Feb 25 02:10:15 <kfrench>	I was told that size doesn't matter
Feb 25 02:10:31 <n4dir>	kfrench: she was only friendly
Feb 25 02:10:33 <athena>	or it's entirely possible I installed this, went "yep okay that works" and then forgot what I was even going to do with it
Feb 25 02:10:40 <NeXeN>	n4dir: you have to also consider what people want......yeah I can run alpine linux or tinycore with it's incredibly light DE ....but then good luck getting video encoding software to work....or a media player....or whatever
Feb 25 02:10:41 <Sparkles>	Backporting, APT pinning are other options which allow more custom approach for packages if required. Debian package manager is awesome, and that transparency in Ubuntu package maintainers is brilliant.
Feb 25 02:10:42 <athena>	and shoved it on the bookshelf
Feb 25 02:10:47 <virginiasplane>	And the other thing is - so, you can pick the package manager ... If a person wants to use Ubuntu but not Snap or Flatpack over apt... you can do that.
Feb 25 02:10:54 <virginiasplane>	That's one of the things I like about Linux
Feb 25 02:11:00 <NeXeN>	their package management systems don't have alot of the apps people want so you end up either compiling or finding some janky alternative
Feb 25 02:11:00 <virginiasplane>	I use Dolphin for my file manager
Feb 25 02:11:06 <n4dir>	NeXeN:  i am not discussing such stuff at all. I was talking about lightweight, and so were you
Feb 25 02:11:24 <hodapp>	wonder how hard it'd be to get a graphical file manager to play nice with zoxide
Feb 25 02:11:29 <virginiasplane>	That's always been annoying
Feb 25 02:11:55 <NeXeN>	n4dir: so i said....tinycore is probably the smallest at like 10 megs.....so for embedded, that's your path, or roll-your-own .....but for an actual user to use ....well 1gig ain't bad if you have say a 256g hard drive
Feb 25 02:12:01 <virginiasplane>	Bitwarden doesn't work good on Snap but the app image does ... the annoying thing about that is depending on the distro, the second part is you have to create a desktop applet
Feb 25 02:12:06 <virginiasplane>	It's not hard to do but it's tedious
Feb 25 02:12:18 <rascul>	virginiasplane ubuntu isn't offering some packages as debs anymore so if you don't want to use the snap you have to do some work
Feb 25 02:12:34 <rascul>	the work might just be finding a deb that works though
Feb 25 02:12:41 <n4dir>	in my world lightweight distro usually means small on ressource usage
Feb 25 02:12:43 <virginiasplane>	I've never had issues installing a deb - any deb on Ubuntu
Feb 25 02:12:53 <rascul>	you will if you have dep mismatches
Feb 25 02:12:54 <NeXeN>	ubuntu studio takes like 35 gigs to have a decent setup ......which is nothing for my 512g laptop....and it runs very nicely
Feb 25 02:13:13 <virginiasplane>	Debian tells you... they have this page that's "don't break Debian" ... I've never broken it ... I've broken Ubuntu but it never had anything to do with package managers
Feb 25 02:13:17 <NeXeN>	it also supports debs, snaps, and flatpaks....though i stay away from snaps and flatpaks because of their size
Feb 25 02:13:28 <rascul>	there are many ways to break a linux install
Feb 25 02:13:29 <virginiasplane>	They say not to inter-mix them... I have had issues with it ... but I've also broken their rules and been find
Feb 25 02:13:34 <sphertext_>	35gb for a linux is a bit bizarre
Feb 25 02:13:39 <Sparkles>	NeXeN, you mean in Debian/Ubuntu? Well, as mentioned, there's APT pinning. Else, indeed, self-compiling is the best safe option I believe.
Feb 25 02:13:39 <virginiasplane>	My experience is that you need to know how to remove things. That simple.
Feb 25 02:13:52 <n4dir>	sphertext_: probably soundfonts and stuff. Still sounds quite weird.
Feb 25 02:14:04 <virginiasplane>	So - and this goes for anyone - if you don't know how to roll back, that's problematic. And I've been there...
Feb 25 02:14:16 <hodapp>	35gb for... soundfonts? wut?
Feb 25 02:14:17 <n4dir>	or perhaps he is just making things up. I get the impression
Feb 25 02:14:30 <Sparkles>	NeXeN, for example, https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tree/+question/709269
Feb 25 02:14:46 <Sparkles>	i.e. https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+faq/3037
Feb 25 02:14:48 <NeXeN>	the front end for the package manager i use, discover, is wonky but it has just about everything....and for anything not in the repo, you can easily add the repos and many apps have the commands ready to copy/paste to add their repos
Feb 25 02:15:03 <Sparkles>	> Please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates for details about the processes around upgrading packages in already-published Ubuntu releases, or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports for the process of backporting the newest version that is available in the development version of Ubuntu to an older release.
Feb 25 02:15:06 <scottbomb>	Running Kubuntu here with lots of software installed and / is ony 17 GB
Feb 25 02:15:15 <n4dir>	holy jesus
Feb 25 02:15:17 <virginiasplane>	I forgot about that one too
Feb 25 02:15:23 <virginiasplane>	That's too many Ubuntu variants
Feb 25 02:15:28 <NeXeN>	hodapp: it installs, by default, video editors, sound recording software, sequencers, graphic design apps, etc
Feb 25 02:15:36 <rascul>	my / is only 43GB after i subtracted the libvirt stuff
Feb 25 02:15:38 <virginiasplane>	See, the Canonical monster will come like a thief in the night, sir.
Feb 25 02:15:42 <NeXeN>	hodapp: it targets "creatives" not just sound engineering
Feb 25 02:15:44 <hodapp>	soundfonts are a very specific thing
Feb 25 02:15:47 <virginiasplane>	He will kidnap you and we will not pay your ransom
Feb 25 02:15:52 <hodapp>	and not one that tends to land you 35 GB of crap
Feb 25 02:16:02 <n4dir>	NeXeN: and yet it isn't anywhere close to the 35 Gigs you mentioned.
Feb 25 02:16:09 <NeXeN>	no?
Feb 25 02:16:12 <n4dir>	no
Feb 25 02:16:13 <solol>	Hm...
Feb 25 02:16:38 <NeXeN>	well on my other machine i partitioned out like 35 or 40 gigs and it installed.....
Feb 25 02:16:39 <virginiasplane>	And someone has surely said this if not today another time, there are VMs
Feb 25 02:16:45 <solol>	What's hadoop become?
Feb 25 02:16:52 <solol>	hodapp u into hadoop?
Feb 25 02:16:55 <hodapp>	solol: nope
Feb 25 02:17:02 <hodapp>	solol: but the answer is something like apache spark, probably
Feb 25 02:17:10 <solol>	What is that
Feb 25 02:17:12 <athena>	I feel like I threw a match on a wood pile
Feb 25 02:17:16 <n4dir>	shit knows how that happened. The iso size as of now is slightly more than 4 Gigs. Not too sure about compression, but that sure isn't too much installed
Feb 25 02:17:22 <virginiasplane>	there is no reason whatsoever that you cannot run most of your stuff on a VM... They perform slower but I have a friend who told me Windows 10 clocked faster on KVM than it did on bare metal
Feb 25 02:17:29 <virginiasplane>	If that's not significant, not sure what is
Feb 25 02:17:31 <n4dir>	athena: yeah, so what is with your old laptop?
Feb 25 02:17:32 <hodapp>	solol: big Java/Scala thingy that lives in the Apache universe of stuff
Feb 25 02:17:40 *	rascul gives athena a can of gasoline
Feb 25 02:17:44 <NeXeN>	i'm sure you can install less but for what i needed....
Feb 25 02:17:51 <sphertext_>	virginiasplane how is that possible tho
Feb 25 02:17:52 <athena>	It's actually running just fine with lubuntu, I think I just forgot about it
Feb 25 02:17:54 <solol>	ha
Feb 25 02:17:55 <hodapp>	understands hdfs and the like
Feb 25 02:18:11 <athena>	It's big and heavy and tethered to a cord so I didn't have an immediate use for it
Feb 25 02:18:12 <sphertext_>	no matter how you spin it, a vm is still another layer of abstraction
Feb 25 02:18:14 <n4dir>	athena: oh, i take this as a "case closed"
Feb 25 02:18:21 <rascul>	virginiasplane not having the hardware support is a reason
Feb 25 02:18:26 <athena>	yeah. that's why I'm feeling bad about throwing the match lmao
Feb 25 02:18:40 <virginiasplane>	I'll have to ask him... Because the Windows supporting architecture on the lower level runs heavy ... so everyone agrees that Windows is heavy
Feb 25 02:18:43 <n4dir>	do it ! don't let your dreams be dreams. throw the match
Feb 25 02:18:54 <virginiasplane>	That's half of the reason I think many use Linux
Feb 25 02:18:55 *	rascul throws n4dir at the match
Feb 25 02:18:59 <rascul>	did i do it right?
Feb 25 02:19:02 <n4dir>	you did
Feb 25 02:19:04 <rascul>	yay!
Feb 25 02:19:06 <virginiasplane>	And KVM is a type 1 hypervisor
Feb 25 02:19:11 <n4dir>	i need a firefighter
Feb 25 02:19:11 *	rascul provides free beer
Feb 25 02:19:11 <NeXeN>	virginiasplane: if you have the video card, win11 isn't bad ....10 either.....you can disable alot of stuff too
Feb 25 02:19:14 <virginiasplane>	If we were talking VirtualBox, it wouldn't happen, I think
Feb 25 02:19:17 <bparker>	I wished ISO standards weren't so hard to find without paying money
Feb 25 02:19:23 *	kfrench drinks free beer.
Feb 25 02:19:23 *	rascul punches n4dir's fire
Feb 25 02:19:27 <NeXeN>	the only thing i don't like is all the partition space win11 "reserves" for updates
Feb 25 02:19:30 <virginiasplane>	But KVM gives bare metal access without the additoinal software layer... and that's your answer
Feb 25 02:19:38 <Sparkles>	'throw the match' sounds maniacal..
Feb 25 02:19:45 <virginiasplane>	I use Windows 11 in Remmina headless
Feb 25 02:20:05 <n4dir>	Sparkles: the minuteman (band) ; people who start fires (the album)
Feb 25 02:20:09 <NeXeN>	i had a laptop with a 64 gig drive and ran up against a limit when I installed linux and eventually just removed win11 because I wanted the space since I never used it
Feb 25 02:20:20 <rascul>	bparker sometimes you can dig up a draft for free and if you can find the last draft sometimes it's the same as the one that costs monies
Feb 25 02:20:40 <Sparkles>	NeXeN, I see. Recalled "World in Flames - Officium Triste".
Feb 25 02:20:44 <bparker>	rascul: yea this isn't ye olde redbook standard unfortunately
Feb 25 02:20:45 <virginiasplane>	So it's not about the OS on the VM, it's about the type of hypervisor
Feb 25 02:20:50 <bparker>	no such draft
Feb 25 02:20:57 <rascul>	:(
Feb 25 02:20:58 <Sparkles>	n4dir, ^ (sorry)
Feb 25 02:21:04 <n4dir>	sorry?
Feb 25 02:21:13 <virginiasplane>	Although Hyper-V ... I don't like it as much as KVM ... it performs slower running Windows and it IS Windows.
Feb 25 02:21:15 <Sparkles>	For the username typo above.
Feb 25 02:21:19 <virginiasplane>	KVM is really good
Feb 25 02:21:35 <sphertext_>	thanks for pointing it out virginiasplane it sounds very interesting
Feb 25 02:21:39 <virginiasplane>	But KVM has bad networking and that's the major drawbacks of VMs as I see it
Feb 25 02:21:40 <n4dir>	Sparkles: i didn't even see it. I am in a mood
Feb 25 02:21:54 <rascul>	what's bad about kvm networking? and do you really mean qemu?
Feb 25 02:21:57 <n4dir>	Sparkles: but i really love the minutemen ; weird music
Feb 25 02:22:10 <sphertext_>	i use some proprietary OS software that is performance critical and it was a pain not being able to run it directly from within linux. looks like with KVM i might be bale ot
Feb 25 02:22:21 <Sparkles>	Thank you for mentioning them. I will checked their Bandcamp.
Feb 25 02:22:26 <Sparkles>	check*
Feb 25 02:22:27 <virginiasplane>	I don't like how it bridges because it wants to own the entire NIC
Feb 25 02:22:32 <virginiasplane>	It would work if it had it's own NIC
Feb 25 02:22:36 <rascul>	that's how bridges work
Feb 25 02:22:37 <virginiasplane>	But it doesn't like sharing
Feb 25 02:22:54 <rascul>	bridges take the interface then you can use the bridge interface and/or attach others to it
Feb 25 02:23:08 <virginiasplane>	Sure it does... but VirtualBox doesn't perform the same...Nor does VMware.
Feb 25 02:23:18 <rascul>	well they're garbage
Feb 25 02:23:21 <bparker>	qemu ftw
Feb 25 02:23:24 <n4dir>	don't they say "sharing is caring" ?
Feb 25 02:23:27 <virginiasplane>	They all interface with the hardware differently
Feb 25 02:23:31 <rascul>	qemu does great
Feb 25 02:23:41 <bparker>	only if you're not running old OSes
Feb 25 02:23:52 <bparker>	then it's a crapshoot that breaks differently with each new version
Feb 25 02:24:01 <NeXeN>	boxes uses qemu under the surface?
Feb 25 02:24:07 <rascul>	yes
Feb 25 02:24:07 <bparker>	surely
Feb 25 02:24:11 <bparker>	what else would it be
Feb 25 02:24:29 <rascul>	uses qemu through libvirt if i recall correctly
Feb 25 02:24:44 <n4dir>	apt-cache show boxes; doesn't really answer my question, au contraire
Feb 25 02:24:46 <rascul>	probably better to use virt-manager instead though
Feb 25 02:24:50 <bparker>	which is really just an overcomplicated launch for qemu itself
Feb 25 02:24:56 <bparker>	launcher*
Feb 25 02:24:57 <NeXeN>	it works to spin up VM images .....i don't do much, mostly we use containers at work
Feb 25 02:25:03 <rascul>	not just qemu though
Feb 25 02:25:25 <bparker>	ok qemu and spicy
Feb 25 02:25:37 <bparker>	or virt-viewer whichever it uses
Feb 25 02:25:40 <rascul>	https://libvirt.org/drivers.html
Feb 25 02:25:45 <n4dir>	i never run in any other person who uses aqemu. I guess it is crap
Feb 25 02:25:57 <bparker>	same
Feb 25 02:25:57 <rascul>	can do your vmware and vbox and lxc stuff with libvirt too
Feb 25 02:26:01 <bparker>	I didn't even know this was a thing
Feb 25 02:26:07 <virginiasplane>	Honestly ... So for all of that... VMware has the best networking - in my humble opinion but it is also the slowest on Ubuntu and you have to disable the hardware accelerator
Feb 25 02:26:15 <virginiasplane>	That's what I am saying ... you have to fine tune all of this
Feb 25 02:26:28 <bparker>	VMs are headed out the door anyway
Feb 25 02:26:35 <bparker>	micro is already working in some places
Feb 25 02:26:46 <rascul>	micro?
Feb 25 02:26:49 <bparker>	microvm
Feb 25 02:26:51 <rascul>	oh
Feb 25 02:27:39 <bparker>	I guess it's supposed to be a middle-ground for basically more isolated containers that aren't so heavy on the resources
Feb 25 02:27:44 <virginiasplane>	If you use VMware... and I am talking about VMs too much but we were discussing the network stuff. For VMware if you try it, make sure to untick the 3D graphics box under the Display option.
Feb 25 02:28:06 <n4dir>	what if i don't try it?
Feb 25 02:28:08 <NeXeN>	virginiasplane: vmware has a couple different hypervisors.....if you're running servers, it's probably the most widely supported
Feb 25 02:28:11 <bparker>	what if I want 3D graphics?
Feb 25 02:28:31 <NeXeN>	for the desktop product, it might be sluggish, but there are some really good performing hypervisors for servers
Feb 25 02:28:58 <virginiasplane>	And that might not be relevant depending on the hardware but I'm running this on a very popular Dell model and I have to do it... and I even have xorg running as opposed to GDM alone or lightdm ... I'm using the old school display server
Feb 25 02:29:02 <rascul>	vmware is broadcom now though
Feb 25 02:29:12 <rascul>	and i heard something about getting rid of the free vmware stuff
Feb 25 02:29:31 <NeXeN>	we use ESXi at work on a few machines
Feb 25 02:29:44 <n4dir>	i never had the idea to run lightdm alone
Feb 25 02:29:51 <NeXeN>	i don't ever want to touch it because i don't understand it, but the VMs seem to run just fine
Feb 25 02:29:53 <n4dir>	might give it a try these days
Feb 25 02:29:58 <rascul>	n4dir what did you have the idea to run it with?
Feb 25 02:30:03 <rascul>	or who?
Feb 25 02:30:03 <virginiasplane>	I liked it running on Windows. I rarely use it on this box. The graphics perform VERY bad on here but like I said, the network options are amazing
Feb 25 02:30:07 <n4dir>	rascul: didn't he say alone?
Feb 25 02:30:17 <buraq>	NeXeN: vmware/broadcom will end the free esxi
Feb 25 02:30:18 <n4dir>	i would fire it up and watch it for a bit. A few hours
Feb 25 02:30:19 <rascul>	i dunno
Feb 25 02:30:26 <rascul>	does it do tricks?
Feb 25 02:30:28 <virginiasplane>	Another issue though is that because Linux permissions are stricter, you have to run VMware for the networking set up as root. VMware likes that. Linux, haha, no sir.
Feb 25 02:30:33 <n4dir>	rascul: i didn't do it yet
Feb 25 02:30:36 <rascul>	oh
Feb 25 02:30:37 <NeXeN>	buraq: it's already ended
Feb 25 02:30:43 <rascul>	wanna do it together?
Feb 25 02:30:56 <n4dir>	rascul: perhaps i will install a few display-manager alone and switch between them
Feb 25 02:30:59 <n4dir>	yeah
Feb 25 02:31:04 <rascul>	i don't really want to do it though
Feb 25 02:31:15 <n4dir>	i trust IRC. It must be a good idea
Feb 25 02:31:23 <rascul>	i don't even remember right now if i use a display manager on this box
Feb 25 02:31:33 <n4dir>	didnt reboot in a while?
Feb 25 02:31:41 <rascul>	last week i think
Feb 25 02:31:45 <rascul>	or the week before
Feb 25 02:31:47 <NeXeN>	is citrix based on xen?
Feb 25 02:31:54 <virginiasplane>	You can if you get stuck and hopefully people are not...
Feb 25 02:32:16 <n4dir>	rascul: i haven't used one in ages, because i don't really understand what they might be good for. But i heard some have reasons to run them
Feb 25 02:32:42 <buraq>	NeXeN: citrix has a product called xenserver
Feb 25 02:32:44 <n4dir>	i mean, you login, and then they keep running, but you never need them again. no?
Feb 25 02:32:53 <rascul>	they're useful for a graphical login prompt and starting your desktop session
Feb 25 02:32:56 <virginiasplane>	You can ... and this is for Ubuntu. Press tty keys f3 to f6, I think. Then you can reset gnome. The most forceful way is sudo systemctl restart gdm3
Feb 25 02:33:03 <rascul>	not the only way to achieve those goals but a common way
Feb 25 02:33:09 <virginiasplane>	There is a less forceful command and I actually wrote a script just for that.
Feb 25 02:33:12 <NeXeN>	yeah i didn't know if it was a marketing term or it actually uses xen
Feb 25 02:33:39 <buraq>	NeXeN: it was free for a while (v6.x or something) but not any more
Feb 25 02:33:42 <NeXeN>	X11 has an option for a key combo to restart X
Feb 25 02:33:49 <n4dir>	rascul: yeah, as said, i wouldn't know. I sure don't miss it, but perhaps i see it wrong
Feb 25 02:34:01 <rascul>	i don't think you see it wrong
Feb 25 02:34:15 <rascul>	if you don't have a use for it then not using it seems acceptable
Feb 25 02:34:18 <NeXeN>	buraq: I never used it.....the only type 1 hypervisors i've installed were kvm and rhev
Feb 25 02:34:21 <virginiasplane>	and if you restart gnome, you then have to wait about 90 seconds, depending on your hardware, press the f1 or f2 key, then you can log back in.
Feb 25 02:34:34 <virginiasplane>	You'd think that a person can do that immediately but that's crazy talk to Canonical
Feb 25 02:34:37 <n4dir>	i could swear somone more smart than me gave me good reasons. It is just stuff i didn't do. rascul
Feb 25 02:34:56 <virginiasplane>	You have to wait enough time for it to reload things but the greeter screen won't tell you that. It will just refuse the login, despite valid credentials
Feb 25 02:35:02 <rascul>	n4dir maybe one day if you try it you might find you like it but until that happens there's nothing wrong with not using it
Feb 25 02:35:07 <n4dir>	i think after i tried the display-manager standalone i will try that gnome thingy
Feb 25 02:35:40 <rascul>	you can usually make them look approximately however you want
Feb 25 02:35:44 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 25 02:35:45 *	litharge removes ban on $a:on0bi
Feb 25 02:35:45 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 25 02:35:46 <n4dir>	rascul: i installed for that guy, the day before yesterday, and he has no clue, so i left the display-manager installed.
Feb 25 02:35:50 <rascul>	back in the day we used xdm but now there's a lot more choices
Feb 25 02:36:03 <virginiasplane>	yeah, and gnome runs sort of heavy. I like KDE Plasma
Feb 25 02:36:04 <n4dir>	i didn't see any problems. besides it was eating ressources without doing anything
Feb 25 02:36:10 <virginiasplane>	but that turns into Kubuntu
Feb 25 02:36:14 <rascul>	resources are delicious
Feb 25 02:36:31 <n4dir>	i heard about xdm
Feb 25 02:36:32 <NeXeN>	virginiasplane: funny because kde used to be the hog of the two
Feb 25 02:36:56 <virginiasplane>	Yeah, it ... I read that KDE has a heavier footprint than gnome but it runs faster in some tests
Feb 25 02:37:11 <virginiasplane>	And I don't know why that is but I know what you're talking about. I have only been using KDE for a couple of weeks but I like it more
Feb 25 02:37:23 <n4dir>	rascul: i mainly gave up because way more than a decade ago lightdm was kinda broken all the time. So instead of troubleshoot again and again, i just removed it
Feb 25 02:37:28 <n4dir>	slim many liked too
Feb 25 02:37:35 <NeXeN>	circa 2000, kde was a beast and gnome was thin
Feb 25 02:37:52 <Khaytsus>	No it wasn't, KDE was pretty light in the 1.x
Feb 25 02:38:01 <virginiasplane>	The interface isn't as sexy but it seems to run better. Now, it's worth noting, I use it on Debian. I can't say how it will do on Ubuntu. It will probably run phemonenally as Kubuntu but I only run it on Debian
Feb 25 02:38:19 <n4dir>	could try trinity, or how it is called, kde3 fork. It is outstanding light, compared with DEs of today
Feb 25 02:38:20 <virginiasplane>	On Debian you get to choose when you install ... it doesn't default to gnome and the gnome on Debian isn't as good as the Ubuntu gnome
Feb 25 02:38:21 <NeXeN>	on my machine it took a good amount of time to load....had some thing that showed all the subsystems loading.....took a minute
Feb 25 02:38:27 <virginiasplane>	Ubuntu has a sleeker gnome
Feb 25 02:39:12 <n4dir>	well, debian does default to gnome. It is just that you can change that
Feb 25 02:39:32 <NeXeN>	for me light doesn't necessarily mean footprint on disk....but how sluggish it was on my hardware....i'm a cheapskate so I always buy/have older stuff
Feb 25 02:39:36 <virginiasplane>	Yeah... I change it. I actually remove it and just install the Debian desktop with KDE
Feb 25 02:39:40 <virginiasplane>	And that is what I'm on now
Feb 25 02:39:56 <rascul>	i thought debian defaulted to xfce
Feb 25 02:40:04 <rbox>	rascul: you're a debian
Feb 25 02:40:06 <rascul>	it's been a long time since i did a debian install though
Feb 25 02:40:10 <rascul>	rbox i am not
Feb 25 02:40:15 <rbox>	rascul: fine, you're a gnome
Feb 25 02:40:24 <rascul>	i'm not even little enough to be a gnome
Feb 25 02:40:35 <n4dir>	to pretty much anyone light means light on resources. Or at least in my world
Feb 25 02:40:36 <virginiasplane>	It does not ... And for Debian I think it changes
Feb 25 02:40:44 <n4dir>	rascul: do it
Feb 25 02:40:48 <virginiasplane>	Debian is older than my great great great grandma and yours combined
Feb 25 02:40:50 <rascul>	n4dir maybe later
Feb 25 02:40:56 <virginiasplane>	It was here ... well... anyway
Feb 25 02:41:07 <rascul>	debian is 30 years old
Feb 25 02:41:18 <n4dir>	rascul: it does default to gnome though.
Feb 25 02:41:21 <NeXeN>	n4dir: some things can be light on disk space but heavy on memory.....some can be heavy on both memory and disk space but runs smoothly.....some can be heavy on disk space, easy on memory....etc
Feb 25 02:41:23 <rascul>	n4dir i believe you
Feb 25 02:41:24 <n4dir>	i am not sure about the past
Feb 25 02:41:31 <rascul>	i am not sure about the past either
Feb 25 02:41:34 <virginiasplane>	I think KDE was probably the original DE for Debian... and I only say that because and I could be wrong, KDE was the first Linux desktop environment.
Feb 25 02:41:56 <virginiasplane>	You can look that up but I read enough Linux books ... I think that's right. And I was surprised because there is stuff sleeker than KDE
Feb 25 02:42:06 <n4dir>	rascul: i quickly started to not install GUI during installation, because ... that metapackage problem
Feb 25 02:42:09 <NeXeN>	depending on your constraint .....you might not have much disk space but plenty of ram or maybe your video card doesn't have good graphical acceleration so if it's some app that uses 3d rendering ...etc
Feb 25 02:42:09 <virginiasplane>	And it's not as popular as gnome is - not by a longshot
Feb 25 02:42:28 <rascul>	virginiasplane depending on what you mean by "Linux desktop environment" kde wasn't first
Feb 25 02:42:46 <n4dir>	what was the first?
Feb 25 02:43:01 <virginiasplane>	I'm not counting Solaris and that is a UNIX, by the way
Feb 25 02:43:08 <rascul>	cde ran on linux before kde existed
Feb 25 02:43:08 <virginiasplane>	Slowaris is what my friends called it
Feb 25 02:43:18 <n4dir>	rascul: ah, right. You mentioned it a few months ago
Feb 25 02:43:20 <rascul>	i dunno what the first linux desktop environment was though
Feb 25 02:43:21 <virginiasplane>	I also don't know enough about Solaris but I tried it and it was interesting
Feb 25 02:43:42 <NeXeN>	well i'll one up you and say I tried sunOS
Feb 25 02:43:46 <NeXeN>	garbage, both
Feb 25 02:43:48 <virginiasplane>	It was fast but many of the commands were just not working. Ha, I got frustrated. I expected it to work just like Linux. No, haha, not how it panned out
Feb 25 02:43:52 <rascul>	kde was originally a more free cde-like thing if i recall correctly
Feb 25 02:44:03 <rascul>	qt wasn't free at the time though but it was not long after
Feb 25 02:44:07 <jamiahx2>	`rsync -ar` is not preserving the attributes
Feb 25 02:44:24 <n4dir>	rascul: when i started computing it was KDE3 and gnome2. I got no real idea what was before
Feb 25 02:44:41 <rascul>	n4dir that's the beginning of time as it matters
Feb 25 02:44:47 <rascul>	2.4 or 2.6 kernel?
Feb 25 02:44:51 <n4dir>	2.6
Feb 25 02:44:54 <rascul>	ok
Feb 25 02:44:58 <virginiasplane>	Try, rsync -X
Feb 25 02:45:05 <n4dir>	debian etch, but it was close to the next release, might have been lenny
Feb 25 02:45:13 <virginiasplane>	"extended attributes and, by the way, I never use that flag
Feb 25 02:45:13 <rascul>	6.8 is basically just 2.6.894630947236109573409560341967907345697354675342
Feb 25 02:45:16 <virginiasplane>	You should test it
Feb 25 02:45:37 <rascul>	linus doesn't like it when the numbers get too big
Feb 25 02:45:38 <n4dir>	then some nuthead told me Sid will break in no time, and i gave it a try to test how long it would take me to break it. And it didn't break
Feb 25 02:45:38 <NeXeN>	ahh the jump from 2.4 to 2.6.....good times those
Feb 25 02:45:42 <virginiasplane>	I mean, I don't know for sure if it'll work. Try it
Feb 25 02:46:01 <rascul>	sid can break sometimes but it doesn't necessarily have to
Feb 25 02:46:10 <n4dir>	yup, that is the misunderstanding
Feb 25 02:46:11 <virginiasplane>	And make sure you preserve the checksum options, so that it validates the hashes match when the transfer finishes
Feb 25 02:46:34 <n4dir>	rascul: and because it didn't break for me doesn't mean it didn't break for someone else
Feb 25 02:46:55 <virginiasplane>	There you go...
Feb 25 02:46:56 <rascul>	i hear that if you break it for someone else then it doesn't break for you that one time
Feb 25 02:46:57 <n4dir>	so if you don't want it to happen, you better don't run it. If you can live with it ... all fine
Feb 25 02:47:07 <n4dir>	rascul: that is true too
Feb 25 02:47:07 <virginiasplane>	Ha, it will break if you work it and work it because you're worth it
Feb 25 02:47:16 <rascul>	it works if you work it
Feb 25 02:47:27 <virginiasplane>	Actually, that's the rally cry for Acoholics Anonymous but... yeah.
Feb 25 02:47:33 <virginiasplane>	No, gotta test yo stuff
Feb 25 02:47:53 <virginiasplane>	I'm out for now. Use the VMs ... and use backups
Feb 25 02:48:02 <n4dir>	rascul: as far i observe devuan testing has lots of trouble right now though. Something they call "merge"
Feb 25 02:48:09 <n4dir>	not sure if same is valid for debian
Feb 25 02:48:22 <n4dir>	stuff gets moved around, that is the merge
Feb 25 02:48:26 <birkoff>	what is the most advanced notification manager for linux ? one that the user also can send it actions to apply
Feb 25 02:48:51 <virginiasplane>	And for all of this - no one has said it - but if you want to fully appreciate Linux, I hardcore suggest not distro hopping
Feb 25 02:48:52 <rascul>	n4dir this one?   https://beta.devuan.org/os/announce/excalibur-usrmerge-announce-2024-02-20.html
Feb 25 02:49:00 <virginiasplane>	It's my humble opinion though
Feb 25 02:49:12 <virginiasplane>	I'd keep the same bare metal Linux for at least six months to test it
Feb 25 02:49:31 <virginiasplane>	I've been running Ubuntu for two years and at a certain point, I decided to part ways
Feb 25 02:49:43 <rascul>	took you too long
Feb 25 02:49:53 <rascul>	i could have told you from the beginning that ubuntu is garbage
Feb 25 02:49:53 <virginiasplane>	But I spent A LOT of time with it to the point where I respect it. The problem is it doesn't respect me and that's why I'm leaving for Deb.
Feb 25 02:49:56 <n4dir>	rascul: i assume. It broke my testing, and i reinstalled stable and didn't really bother anymore
Feb 25 02:50:15 <rascul>	n4dir seems like you cheated
Feb 25 02:50:21 <n4dir>	ha ha. yeah. i did
Feb 25 02:50:34 <n4dir>	using debian for 2 decades and re-installing. How lame
Feb 25 02:51:07 <jamiahx2>	virginiasplane nope
Feb 25 02:51:21 <jamiahx2>	wait....
Feb 25 02:51:31 <rascul>	some people have things setup so that installs are almost ephemeral and it's almost trivial to setup whatever distro the dice tells them to install at the time
Feb 25 02:51:47 <rascul>	i think ansible is one of the tools that can help with that
Feb 25 02:52:17 *	rbox sets up rascul with ansible
Feb 25 02:52:21 <rascul>	ansible is too yaml for me
Feb 25 02:52:22 <rbox>	rascul: now you are reproducible
Feb 25 02:52:31 <rascul>	do you really want me to reproduce?
Feb 25 02:52:52 <rascul>	just imagine four of me plaguing the channel in a decade or two
Feb 25 02:52:54 <n4dir>	i thought you were a self-generating patch, modular synth style
Feb 25 02:53:18 <n4dir>	something ambient
Feb 25 02:53:24 <rascul>	four of me could drink a lot of beer though
Feb 25 02:53:33 <rascul>	when they're old enough
Feb 25 02:53:37 <jamiahx2>	virginiasplane https://pastebin.com/jA17zvaW
Feb 25 02:53:40 <kfrench>	I'll notify the National Beer Reserve
Feb 25 02:53:43 <NeXeN>	rascul: that's the problem.....we'd run out of resources.... (beer)
Feb 25 02:53:54 <n4dir>	NO ! not that !
Feb 25 02:54:06 <rascul>	yeah let's not let me reproduce then
Feb 25 02:54:13 <rascul>	rbox take that playbook back
Feb 25 02:54:18 <rascul>	before it's too late
Feb 25 02:54:21 <NeXeN>	that's why you're unique.....evolution.....survival of the fittest....you are the weed that chokes out the other weeds
Feb 25 02:54:47 <rascul>	no, i smoke the weed not choke it
Feb 25 02:54:55 <rascul>	sometimes vape it or eat it or something though
Feb 25 02:55:00 <NeXeN>	you've never choked on a bong?
Feb 25 02:55:07 <NeXeN>	you're not doing it right then
Feb 25 02:55:08 <rascul>	i have, not the weed
Feb 25 02:55:14 <rascul>	ice can help
Feb 25 02:55:22 <NeXeN>	thats a myth
Feb 25 02:55:25 <n4dir>	isn't there a new thing with weed? you kinda re-use it?
Feb 25 02:55:28 <rascul>	it's not
Feb 25 02:55:30 <JanC>	KDE, Window Maker & GnuStep are probably about the same age all
Feb 25 02:55:33 <zen_desu>	ice absolutely helps
Feb 25 02:55:36 <NeXeN>	it's not new, it's called resin
Feb 25 02:55:52 <zen_desu>	if you vaporize weed adn don't burn it, the leftovers have decarbed thc in it
Feb 25 02:55:52 <NeXeN>	when the weed man is lagging
Feb 25 02:55:54 <zen_desu>	so you can eat it
Feb 25 02:55:57 <rascul>	dry herb can be smoked three times
Feb 25 02:56:15 <n4dir>	well, new to me, NeXeN , i heard it just 2 weeks ago. Not sure if that was the word i heard
Feb 25 02:56:23 <rascul>	once normally, then scrape the pipe and smoke that, then smoke the kief
Feb 25 02:56:33 <NeXeN>	kief at the bottom of your grinder?
Feb 25 02:56:38 <rascul>	yes, of course
Feb 25 02:56:39 <n4dir>	but they went straight for it.
Feb 25 02:56:45 <zen_desu>	ive got a reclaim collector in my dab rig, i do low temp dabs with an enail so the reclaim is nearly identical to what i smoke, it's basically just whatever vaporized and re-condensed quickly
Feb 25 02:56:48 <n4dir>	not real smoking, they did it first
Feb 25 02:57:00 <Khaytsus>	Can we not talk about drugs
Feb 25 02:57:06 *	NeXeN laughs
Feb 25 02:57:08 <rascul>	probably a good idea
Feb 25 02:57:14 <NeXeN>	it's a little offtopic.....but not by much
Feb 25 02:57:19 <rascul>	linux is my perfect drug
Feb 25 02:57:26 <rascul>	can't talk about linux now
Feb 25 02:57:31 <zen_desu>	yeah but i don't generlaly inhale my rig
Feb 25 02:57:32 <NeXeN>	might relapse?
Feb 25 02:57:42 <zen_desu>	i just inhale what's in it once it gets real hot
Feb 25 02:57:48 <rbox>	rascul: do you get high on linux?
Feb 25 02:57:50 <zen_desu>	helps me not choke on it
Feb 25 02:57:51 <jamiahx2>	okay so..... maybe append into an archive on the server?
Feb 25 02:58:01 *	rascul pulls his linux out and shakes it at rbox
Feb 25 02:58:12 <rascul>	rbox just like that except i'll stand on a stool to get high
Feb 25 02:58:31 <n4dir>	i sure have to shake my keyboard twice a day
Feb 25 02:58:54 <NeXeN>	stop eating chips and coding at the same time
Feb 25 02:58:55 <rascul>	gotta shake the roaches out
Feb 25 02:59:01 <n4dir>	tobaco
Feb 25 02:59:13 <rbox>	rascul: the pappa roasch?
Feb 25 02:59:17 <NeXeN>	should definitely stop smoking alltogether then
Feb 25 02:59:34 <n4dir>	won't the keybaord miss the shaking, once used to it?
Feb 25 02:59:41 <rascul>	rbox only as a last resort though
Feb 25 03:00:05 <rbox>	rascul: as long as there is no suffocation
Feb 25 03:00:38 <NeXeN>	no breathing? don't give a fsck.ext2 if I cut myself bleeding?
Feb 25 03:00:54 <rascul>	damnit you NeXeN i was almost done typing before you beat me
Feb 25 03:01:13 <NeXeN>	gmta
Feb 25 03:01:21 <rascul>	i don't have a gmta
Feb 25 03:02:10 <n4dir>	georgia motor trucking association. Not too sure how it relates, but at least i learned something
Feb 25 03:02:26 <rascul>	i don't have any motor trucking associations
Feb 25 03:02:53 <n4dir>	head over to georgia and get yourself one
Feb 25 03:03:51 <rascul>	that's on the other side of alabama and i don't want to drive that far
Feb 25 03:04:36 <n4dir>	ok. i will go there, grab one, then pass alabama, then hand it over to you.
Feb 25 03:04:41 <rascul>	ok, that'll work
Feb 25 03:04:49 <rascul>	i'll have beer for you when you get here
Feb 25 03:04:54 <n4dir>	deal
Feb 25 03:05:37 <rascul>	i'd rather go to florida though, it's a lot closer and it has more beaches and alligators and stuff
Feb 25 03:06:23 <n4dir>	but no motor truck asscociation
Feb 25 03:06:30 <n4dir>	at least not the georgia one
Feb 25 03:07:02 <rascul>	well they can just motor truck themselves to florida then
Feb 25 03:08:15 <jamiahx2>	it appears I cannot get the correct xattr on osx server
Feb 25 03:08:32 <Khaytsus>	jamiahx2: WHat doe OSX Server hae to do with Linux?
Feb 25 03:08:47 <rascul>	i think there's an osx channel around here somewhere
Feb 25 03:08:55 <jamiahx2>	I'm copying from a clone of a failed linux drive onto an osx server
Feb 25 03:10:24 <rbox>	Khaytsus: what's OSX got to do... got to do with it...
Feb 25 03:11:08 <jamiahx2>	it happens to be the server I'm temporarily storing the files on until I remap my new drive
Feb 25 03:13:19 <tusko>	OSX is the red pill
Feb 25 03:14:13 <jamiahx2>	*headache* do I really need to get a 4th drive formatted to btrfs?
Feb 25 03:14:19 <Disconsented>	Lets uh avoid all of the "pills" thanks
Feb 25 03:15:11 <Khaytsus>	I would have thought Apple users chose blue personally
Feb 25 03:15:25 <rascul>	which color pill is for beer?
Feb 25 03:15:35 <jamiahx2>	piss color
Feb 25 03:16:06 <rascul>	which shade though?
Feb 25 03:17:07 <ellis>	> osx server
Feb 25 03:17:08 <ellis>	ew
Feb 25 03:17:18 <jamiahx2>	not my choice
Feb 25 03:19:27 <ellis>	is it one of the desktop ones? i haven't heard of many ppl running osx as server
Feb 25 03:28:37 <tusko>	its not about win or lose because we all lose when they feed on the souls of the innocent
Feb 25 03:37:37 <rvgate>	last time i had to manage an osx server was in 2007 during an internship, they used it as ftp server / network storage. i really hope they burned that machine by now
Feb 25 03:40:07 <NeXeN>	ooookay
Feb 25 03:41:28 <rvgate>	sorry, got triggered by the previous convo, now going down memory lane :P
Feb 25 03:41:50 <jamiahx2>	I think it's a mac mini now
Feb 25 03:43:02 <NeXeN>	what's that tool called that lets you pull down and compile all the qt stuff?
Feb 25 03:44:25 <bane_killgrind>	tinder
Feb 25 03:44:33 <ellis>	lol
Feb 25 03:44:38 <ayecee>	rimshot
Feb 25 03:45:04 <bane_killgrind>	i'm sorry i'm useless
Feb 25 03:45:16 <ayecee>	don't beat yourself up. let us help.
Feb 25 03:45:43 <bane_killgrind>	:D
Feb 25 03:46:47 <bane_killgrind>	QT creator? NeXeN ?
Feb 25 03:47:06 <NeXeN>	i can't remember....it's a cool utility that lets you get it and build it easily
Feb 25 03:48:01 <NeXeN>	oh is it ministro? hmm
Feb 25 03:49:41 <NeXeN>	oh wait no....nevermind....i'm thinking of a tool for kde.....though it does download qt for you
Feb 25 03:53:31 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 25 03:53:32 *	litharge removes ban on *!*@162-1-21-31.ftth.glasoperator.nl$##fix_your_connection
Feb 25 03:53:32 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 25 03:53:33 <rvgate>	NeXeN: Qt Installer Framework ?
Feb 25 03:57:07 <jamiahx2>	okay, I got `tar` to preserve the xattr
Feb 25 03:57:26 <jamiahx2>	anybody know how I can make `tar` stop and throw big warnings upon a read error?
Feb 25 03:58:41 <NeXeN>	jamiahx2: well the option to ignore read errors is --ignore-failed-read
Feb 25 03:58:59 <jamiahx2>	I definitely do not want that
Feb 25 03:59:15 <NeXeN>	then it will exit with nonzero status on error
Feb 25 03:59:31 <NeXeN>	unless you might have some alias at play that adds that option....otherwise it should normally operate how you are describing
Feb 25 03:59:50 <jamiahx2>	good, thank you
Feb 25 04:00:59 <JanC>	there is -v/--verbose and --warning also
Feb 25 04:01:17 <NeXeN>	yes, it should spit out 2 if it has a problem.....1 is a return for special modes
Feb 25 04:01:43 <NeXeN>	see at the bottom of man page under RETURN VALUE
Feb 25 04:02:19 <JanC>	assuming this is GNU tar of course
Feb 25 04:02:36 <NeXeN>	one would quite naturally assume
Feb 25 04:03:02 <JanC>	BSD's have their own tar, etc.
Feb 25 04:04:27 <JanC>	(which you can install on linux)
Feb 25 04:05:10 <evilscreww>	so i paid a visit to our friends over in oftc
Feb 25 04:05:17 <evilscreww>	its quite an inactive server by the looks
Feb 25 04:05:51 <jamiahx2>	does `tar` maintain links?
Feb 25 04:06:03 <Khaytsus>	yes
Feb 25 04:06:20 <sheep>	some channels on oftc are farily active, but it's a smaller network than athis oen
Feb 25 04:06:24 <sheep>	*than this one
Feb 25 04:06:38 <evilscreww>	ah
Feb 25 04:06:41 <Khaytsus>	evilscreww got confused listening to a troll last night....
Feb 25 04:07:08 <NeXeN>	you can tell it to keep directory symlinks, you can unlink (also recursively), dereference sym and hard links, etc
Feb 25 04:07:13 <evilscreww>	wait, he wasn't with you guys?
Feb 25 04:07:19 <SFaulken>	don't listen to trolls, they'll just steal your IQ's.
Feb 25 04:07:33 <Khaytsus>	The guy babbling about "oftc is official for linux", no, he has issues.
Feb 25 04:07:59 <jamiahx2>	I'm trying to preserve the file structure completely, do I need to specify maintaining symlinks or is that default behavior?
Feb 25 04:08:01 <evilscreww>	i just assume anyone who answers my queries is a smartie pants
Feb 25 04:08:05 <evilscreww>	perhaps i should look into that
Feb 25 04:08:23 <Khaytsus>	jamiahx2: Pretty sure that's default
Feb 25 04:08:32 <NeXeN>	you can also cast symlinks to hardlinks
Feb 25 04:08:55 <Khaytsus>	jamiahx2: Just keep in mind that it'll happily point to a file that you don't archive, by default
Feb 25 04:09:03 <evilscreww>	bbl
Feb 25 04:09:14 <Khaytsus>	So you could get a dangling symlink, it doesn't magically also do some other path/filesystem/etc
Feb 25 04:09:16 <jamiahx2>	`-h, --dereference      Follow symlinks; archive and dump the files they point to.`
Feb 25 04:09:23 <NeXeN>	a symlink is a file like any other....a hardlink is the file even if it's hardlinked elsewhere
Feb 25 04:09:33 <Khaytsus>	Yes, you can specify that, I'm kind of not sure how that works but
Feb 25 04:09:42 <jamiahx2>	so I need to use `-h` in order to maintain linked files?
Feb 25 04:09:50 <Khaytsus>	hardlink is just another reference to the same inode
Feb 25 04:09:54 <NeXeN>	a symlink points to a hardlink, and a hardlink points to a file....you can have multiple hardlinks to the same file
Feb 25 04:10:05 <NeXeN>	when all the hardlinks to a file are deleted, the file is "deleted"
Feb 25 04:10:07 <evilscreww>	back.
Feb 25 04:10:11 <NeXeN>	or at least hard to find :^)
Feb 25 04:10:13 <jamiahx2>	huh
Feb 25 04:10:28 <NeXeN>	symlinks point to hardlinks.....hardlinks point to files.....
Feb 25 04:10:48 <jamiahx2>	this partition is my `/home` directory and I'm trying to extract everything but steam games
Feb 25 04:11:06 <NeXeN>	in essence, they are all files that tar will slurp up....but if you have a symlink that you haven't brought in any other way and you actually want the file its self, you have to cast the symlink to a hardlink
Feb 25 04:11:08 <Khaytsus>	Can always download those again I guess
Feb 25 04:11:29 <NeXeN>	if the steam games are symlinked, then you'll just gobble up the symlinks, the files themselves won't transfer
Feb 25 04:12:11 <NeXeN>	imagine it like windows shortcuts.....copying the shortcut doesn't get the file ......the shortcut is synonymous to a symlink
Feb 25 04:12:18 <jamiahx2>	ah
Feb 25 04:12:21 <jamiahx2>	that makes sense
Feb 25 04:12:31 <NeXeN>	yes, to a window user it does.....to a linux user symlinks make sense
Feb 25 04:12:59 <jamiahx2>	so I should `--dereference --hard-dereference`?
Feb 25 04:13:33 <NeXeN>	it's unlikely you want that option
Feb 25 04:14:23 <jamiahx2>	`--check-links`?
Feb 25 04:14:27 <NeXeN>	it essentially doesn't copy the hardlink but the whole file....so if you have two hardlinks to the same file, you'll get a duplicate of that file, metadata and all
Feb 25 04:14:35 <jamiahx2>	ohhhhh
Feb 25 04:14:47 <NeXeN>	it's not likely that you have duplicate hardlinks, but you never know
Feb 25 04:15:25 <jamiahx2>	so should I go back when I'm done and `tar --list --check-links`?
Feb 25 04:15:44 <NeXeN>	--check-links just checks the number of links dumped .....so like if the number of hardlinks doesn't match the actual number of links dumped, it'll tell you
Feb 25 04:16:08 <NeXeN>	there's very few times you'll ever need to worry about that on non-tape media
Feb 25 04:16:46 <jamiahx2>	by dumped does it mean added to archive?
Feb 25 04:18:04 <NeXeN>	a dump is a backup, and when dereferencing and other operations you "dump links"
Feb 25 04:18:18 <NeXeN>	such as duplicating the file as we discussed previously
Feb 25 04:18:41 <NeXeN>	you have to understand, tar stands for tape archiver.......its terminology is that of backups
Feb 25 04:18:45 <espresso>	vnc trying to win My Most Troublesome Configuration award. openssl quite informative too: 'ssl error: error:1E08010C:DECODER routines::unsupported' I'm about to give up and let x11vnc generate the certs, but it adds a bunch of info and passphrase..
Feb 25 04:19:36 <NeXeN>	espresso: is the cert in raw or pem format?
Feb 25 04:19:50 <jamiahx2>	okay.... this is 96.81% cloned data so... I guess I'll use `--check-links` to check for corruption?
Feb 25 04:20:02 <NeXeN>	or der or ...whatever?
Feb 25 04:20:25 <NeXeN>	jamiahx2: it won't check for corruption
Feb 25 04:20:29 <jamiahx2>	ah
Feb 25 04:20:37 <espresso>	NeXeN: pem.  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/CN=rp" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:rp,IP:10.0.0.2"
Feb 25 04:20:38 <NeXeN>	jamiahx2: it's a tool for scripting backups and counting the dereferenced links and so forth
Feb 25 04:20:57 <jamiahx2>	so way outside my use case
Feb 25 04:21:41 <NeXeN>	espresso: fairly new version of openssl and vnc?
Feb 25 04:22:14 <bane_killgrind>	my proxmox can't resolve github.com...
Feb 25 04:22:45 <bane_killgrind>	I did a firewall thing on my router to blackhole all dns through my pihole
Feb 25 04:22:50 <rbox>	blackhole sun...
Feb 25 04:23:42 <espresso>	NeXeN: added -outform PEM too, but that wasn't working. openssl 3.0.11, x11vnc 0.9.16 (2019-01-05) HMM....
Feb 25 04:23:42 <bane_killgrind>	i'm trying to install homeassistant and there's a helper script to spin up a new VB
Feb 25 04:23:45 <bane_killgrind>	VM
Feb 25 04:24:21 <NeXeN>	espresso: try changing algorithms ....
Feb 25 04:24:27 <NeXeN>	i had this error before too but i can't remember what i did
Feb 25 04:24:46 <NeXeN>	i think the cert was generated on a windows box ...or something
Feb 25 04:26:15 <jamiahx2>	`sudo tar --preserve-permissions --same-owner --acls --selinux --xattrs --append -f /media/server/jamiahx-rescue.tar /media/jamiahxecryptfs2/Desktop/eve.bak`
Feb 25 04:26:30 <jamiahx2>	that's the command I have so far, is it missing anything?
Feb 25 04:26:42 <NeXeN>	a reason for existing....why are you doing this anyways?
Feb 25 04:26:46 <NeXeN>	why not dd the drive image?
Feb 25 04:26:54 <jamiahx2>	oh, it's already been cloned
Feb 25 04:27:02 <jamiahx2>	96.81%
Feb 25 04:27:11 <NeXeN>	it died or what?
Feb 25 04:27:26 <NeXeN>	you might get better luck/performance from rsync as well
Feb 25 04:27:34 <jamiahx2>	original is pretty much dead, only a trickle will read off it now and only after resting for an hour or so
Feb 25 04:27:35 <NeXeN>	along with bazillions of rsync based backup tools
Feb 25 04:28:01 <NeXeN>	I would also identify what files are truly necessary....cat photos, pr0n, etc
Feb 25 04:28:08 <NeXeN>	everything else can be re-installed
Feb 25 04:28:21 <jamiahx2>	I'm copying the files off one of the clones .... yeah
Feb 25 04:28:53 <jamiahx2>	also doing this to identify incomplete important files so I can extract it from the near-death original
Feb 25 04:30:25 <NeXeN>	jamiahx2: also, this advice is like telling someone you should have buckled up before an accident....but still, you should have a good backup policy in place
Feb 25 04:30:40 <jamiahx2>	I was being cheap
Feb 25 04:30:48 <jamiahx2>	#lessonlearned
Feb 25 04:30:51 <NeXeN>	i don't judge
Feb 25 04:31:28 <NeXeN>	you're also learning the in and outs of tar......be glad you don't actually *have* to use it like we did back in the dizzy
Feb 25 04:31:53 <NeXeN>	I actually used to have tape backups....I even had a sweeet hp backup autoloader that took 8 tapes.....1 for each day of the week and an 8th cleaner tape
Feb 25 04:31:55 <jamiahx2>	I think my dad has a tape archive somewhere
Feb 25 04:32:55 <NeXeN>	i had the autoloader and a compaq ML350 server, compliments of a gig I did (i wrote a backup system for a very large retailer)
Feb 25 04:36:14 <jamiahx2>	oh, is btrfs going to throw errors for me with incomplete files or am I going to get silence?
Feb 25 04:37:06 <ayecee>	it's gonna throw errors.
Feb 25 04:37:06 <Khaytsus>	Last tape backup I used personally was a VCR :D  Bought some thing that hoooked up to the parallel port
Feb 25 04:37:14 <jamiahx2>	good
Feb 25 04:39:15 <bane_killgrind>	OK cool so if you blackhole DNS at home a la https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy-KjcY5sgE you need to point Proxmox DNS directly to the pihole or you won't be able to resolve DNS on the hypervisor
Feb 25 04:39:43 <rbox>	bane_killgrind: you think its agoing to magically know where to look up?
Feb 25 04:40:42 <ayecee>	well yeah. that's how magic works.
Feb 25 04:40:49 <bane_killgrind>	yeah, since all DNS requests going through the gateawy should get redirected to the pihole
Feb 25 04:41:27 <Khaytsus>	clients should get the pihole as their DNS if you want them filterd...  but yes the pihole has to have _some_ upstream DNS server.
Feb 25 04:41:38 <rbox>	bane_killgrind: sounds like you dindt set that up propelry then
Feb 25 04:41:39 <bane_killgrind>	gateway's DHCP server points to the pihole for DNS, but proxmox didn't get the memo and wont play nice with the NAT redirect?
Feb 25 04:41:55 <espresso>	NeXeN: i can work from x11vnc -sslGenCA. thanks!
Feb 25 04:42:00 <rbox>	sounds like you're not using dhcp then
Feb 25 04:42:05 <bane_killgrind>	rbox: definitely, the question is what exactly is wrong
Feb 25 04:42:58 <bane_killgrind>	rbox: maybe that's it?? proxmox has a DNS server feild in the webui, maybe it uses that default instead of taking it from DNS
Feb 25 04:43:15 <ayecee>	makes sense
Feb 25 04:43:29 <Khaytsus>	Do you want all of the (VMs I assume?) in the proxmox filtered?
Feb 25 04:43:40 <Khaytsus>	For me, I only filter specific machines, but, that's me
Feb 25 04:44:02 <bane_killgrind>	Khaytsus everything at my house resolves dns through the pihole
Feb 25 04:44:26 <Khaytsus>	There are some machines I need to control ad blocking more granularly, not "globally"
Feb 25 04:45:18 <bane_killgrind>	i think pihole can let you make exceptions per client but I haven't dug in
Feb 25 04:45:27 <JakLareo>	bane_killgrind: that "DNS server" field in Proxmox's UI effectively sets the DNS entries for /etc/resolv.conf for the Proxmox host itself. However, Proxmox will just make standard DNS queries to those servers, if you have a NAT redirect that's properly configured, it should be catching it
Feb 25 04:46:03 <Khaytsus>	bane_killgrind: Praps, never paid attention to that
Feb 25 04:46:19 <bane_killgrind>	JakLareo: it works for all my other devices and all of the vms on proxmox
Feb 25 04:46:29 <Khaytsus>	Honestly I set up my pihole like 6 years ago and have barely touched it
Feb 25 04:46:41 <Khaytsus>	I did go update all the sources a while abck, they were hopelessly out of date :D
Feb 25 04:46:48 <JakLareo>	bane_killgrind: well, Proxmox isn't doing any special magic with its DNS queries, so I'd check your NAT rule
Feb 25 04:48:12 <bane_killgrind>	I think it's ok the way it is
Feb 25 04:48:28 <bane_killgrind>	things that respect the dhcp server will resolve DNS through the pihole
Feb 25 04:48:48 <bane_killgrind>	stuff that doesn't just fails, which is what I want.
Feb 25 04:49:05 *	ayecee sets up the hypervisor to use dhcp
Feb 25 04:49:19 <bane_killgrind>	If I buy a smartTV that refuses to use the DNS set by DHCP or whatever, i'm just going to return it as defective
Feb 25 04:49:29 <kfrench>	ayecee: You're not my hypervisor!
Feb 25 04:50:11 <JakLareo>	FYI, many devices these days use DNS lookups as a way to test if they have network connectivity, and they often use hardcoded DNS servers. You may run into unexpected behavior without a NAT redirect in place
Feb 25 04:50:11 <Khaytsus>	My Roku picks up my pihole as the DNS server, but I don't notice any difference..
Feb 25 04:50:14 <bane_killgrind>	maybe i'll finally get back into pirating everything like a good anarchist should
Feb 25 04:50:30 <Khaytsus>	bane_killgrind: Can you not
Feb 25 04:50:39 <bane_killgrind>	e_e
Feb 25 04:50:53 <korn3r>	long live anarchy
Feb 25 04:51:18 <bane_killgrind>	I also have a roku and it's fine so far. I'm waiting for the hammer to drop though
Feb 25 04:51:21 <jamiahx2>	https://pastebin.com/QXy5a0kB
Feb 25 04:51:27 <Khaytsus>	I sometimes wonder if it's messing with Hulu though..  Hulu shows ads, but sometimes it'll go to show an ad, then starts playing the next episode of something.  Annoying.
Feb 25 04:51:33 <jamiahx2>	so it finally said something about links
Feb 25 04:52:22 <rbox>	Khaytsus: ads? what is this, the 1980s?
Feb 25 04:52:33 <Khaytsus>	I pay for the cheapest Hulu plan :P
Feb 25 04:52:53 <korn3r>	jamiahx2: thats ok log, whats the issue?
Feb 25 04:53:21 <bane_killgrind>	Ads are the tool of the devil ever since marlboro started using them
Feb 25 04:53:22 <jamiahx2>	I hadn't seen those messages before and wasn't sure if there was a problem
Feb 25 04:54:13 <jamiahx2>	especially since I see no links or `/` while looking at the files
Feb 25 04:54:18 <korn3r>	jamiahx2: its just saying it removes first / from path when adding, so path in archive would be media/jamiahxecryptfs2/Desktop/eve.bak
Feb 25 04:55:43 <NeXeN>	Khaytsus: oh yeah those vcr based tape backup thingies were very cool
Feb 25 04:55:55 <NeXeN>	you could backup your 32 meg hard drive and your movie collection with one device
Feb 25 04:56:23 <Khaytsus>	I had a 100 or 200 meg HD at the time, forget..  seems like the VCR would back up 250M?  I forget
Feb 25 04:56:40 <NeXeN>	holy snikeys! you must have been rich
Feb 25 04:56:41 <Khaytsus>	Did have to buy nicer tapes but it was still only like..  $10
Feb 25 04:57:13 <NeXeN>	I used to boot from a floppy back then because i couldn't figure out how to install lilo on the hard drive
Feb 25 04:57:16 <Khaytsus>	No..  I was always behind on HDD..  if I got a 100, 200's were out etc :P
Feb 25 04:57:44 <hodapp>	bane_killgrind: before that... see "Century of the Self" by Adam Curtis
Feb 25 04:57:58 <Khaytsus>	I can't think of timeframe now..  1990?  91?
Feb 25 04:58:03 <NeXeN>	used to take two....i forget why....like the bootloader was on one and the kernel on the other? or the initrd?
Feb 25 04:58:17 <NeXeN>	200 megs? oh no, that's closer to 94
Feb 25 04:58:32 <NeXeN>	in 90 or 91 you might still be hot swappin floppies
Feb 25 04:58:38 <Khaytsus>	NeXeN: I had a drive fail on me, replaced it, copied files off, then realized it was my boot disk even though I didn't realize it was..  booted off floppy for like a month before I got around to sorting it
Feb 25 04:58:54 <korn3r>	swapping 5.25 floppies lika DJ
Feb 25 04:59:00 <NeXeN>	ah, those were the days
Feb 25 04:59:27 <Khaytsus>	NeXeN: Probably...  Seems like 89 I had my 10M drive..  used that for several years, got 100M, used that for 2-3 years, got the 200 (250, something, forget)
Feb 25 04:59:55 <NeXeN>	i think by about 96 i had a 325 meg scsi drive
Feb 25 05:00:41 <Khaytsus>	These were iirc Quantum Fireballs..  scsi, on the Amiga.  Also prone to stiction later on, that was annoying
Feb 25 05:01:00 <Khaytsus>	Had to literally wiggle the case to get them to spin up
Feb 25 05:01:14 <rbox>	Khaytsus: he's a FIRE BALL...
Feb 25 05:01:26 <korn3r>	Any ideas where category "Administration" for firewall-config might come from using XFCE if firewall-config.desktop doesnt mention "Administration" category?
Feb 25 05:01:43 <bane_killgrind>	hodapp: two minutes in and i'm going to make this required watching for my friend group
Feb 25 05:01:53 <NeXeN>	you might have had 100 megs even as early as 90....hmmm ....i'm thinking i did have one of those old winchester drives with like 80 megs early as ...oh 92 or so
Feb 25 05:02:31 <Khaytsus>	NeXeN: Yeah, I'm fuzzy on it all ;)  My 10M was an MFM with a SCSI card attached to it, 5.25", full height.  Was a chonk.
Feb 25 05:02:33 <hodapp>	bane_killgrind: note in particular the point at which advertisement and propaganda just became the same thing
Feb 25 05:03:11 <SFaulken>	I miss hard drives that made me worry they were going to heave themselves off the desk while spinning up.
Feb 25 05:03:21 <Ximo>	not me
Feb 25 05:03:30 <Khaytsus>	NeXeN: That drive almost was free..  I won one of the first color hand scanners at a computer conference.  Traded it with a guy that ran a PC/Amiga store for the SCSI adapter/box/drive, cost a little but mostly even
Feb 25 05:03:42 <Khaytsus>	SFaulken: brrrrrrrr click click.. brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt click
Feb 25 05:03:46 <korn3r>	SFaulken: do you miss cd-drives that sometimes forgot to spindown cd before opening cage?
Feb 25 05:03:54 <Khaytsus>	SFaulken: If it made any noise you didn't recognize, PANIC
Feb 25 05:03:59 <Ximo>	this is the last machine of mine that still has spinning rust and i'm just waiting for the day it croaks =)
Feb 25 05:04:07 <NeXeN>	Khaytsus: yes, start the backup, hurry!
Feb 25 05:04:08 <SFaulken>	korn3r:  I like a little danger with my computing, yes.
Feb 25 05:04:09 <bane_killgrind>	DON'T MOVE THE LAPTOP WHILE IT IS ON
Feb 25 05:04:56 <NeXeN>	i had a drive that was dying for years....litterally it would go out and I would plug it in, it would "click-click-click" which is usually a death knell....then I would unplug it while the power was on and plug it back in....a spark would jump and it would crank right up like an old lawn mower
Feb 25 05:05:24 <NeXeN>	filled dmesg logs up with all sorts of complaints from the kernel subsystems
Feb 25 05:05:32 <SFaulken>	NeXeN:  I had a few of those.
Feb 25 05:05:40 <Sparkles>	bane_killgrind, it depedns on whether it has HDD or SSD I believe.
Feb 25 05:05:42 <NeXeN>	western digital....it was a champ....
Feb 25 05:05:45 <Khaytsus>	I had a few drives over the years give me warning..  spinning up and down, extra noises, etc...  I had an SSD once that just disappeared; never saw it again.
Feb 25 05:05:47 <Ximo>	the bearings often went first
Feb 25 05:07:12 <Ximo>	or the lubrication thereof
Feb 25 05:07:34 <jamiahx2>	`tar: /media/jamiahxecryptfs2/Downloads/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64-3.1.7.run: File shrank by 75055060 bytes; padding with zeros`
Feb 25 05:07:36 <Khaytsus>	I did have one drive have a head crash randomly..  suddenly it sounded like a banshee screeching
Feb 25 05:07:43 <hodapp>	or the lubrication thereof? ain't that a metallica album?
Feb 25 05:07:52 <bane_killgrind>	Sparkles: half my life SSDs did not exist
Feb 25 05:07:54 <bane_killgrind>	I think
Feb 25 05:08:06 <Khaytsus>	Half?  Cute.
Feb 25 05:08:30 <Ximo>	hodapp: haha sounds about right
Feb 25 05:08:52 <bane_killgrind>	Khat i'm still a spring chicken according to many
Feb 25 05:08:55 <SFaulken>	I had a machine for a while, dual Slot Pentium II's, with six 10,000 RPM SCSI drives in it, that one was fun, I was always worried that it was going to cause the house to burn down, when firing it up, and watching every light in the house dim.
Feb 25 05:09:13 <NeXeN>	youngsters these days
Feb 25 05:09:19 <Khaytsus>	SFaulken: I had a pair of 15k scsi's once..  GOD they were loud
Feb 25 05:09:24 <NeXeN>	"oh I remember when we had only 256 gigs on our phones"
Feb 25 05:09:38 <SFaulken>	Khaytsus:  yeah.  but damn they were fast, for their time.
Feb 25 05:09:44 <Ximo>	thankfully those platter cores are plastic, otherwise imagine if one of those let go
Feb 25 05:09:48 <espresso>	aye, that SCSI hd that sounded like a jet engine
Feb 25 05:09:49 <Khaytsus>	SFaulken: Yes they were, that was nice
Feb 25 05:09:53 <CrtxReavr>	In the .bomb era, I did a DNS migration for this failing .com and was paid in hardware. . .
Feb 25 05:09:59 <hodapp>	"I remember when we had to browse to facebook.com and our phones weren't rectally inserted yet" "that's nice grandpa let's get you to bed"
Feb 25 05:10:09 <bane_killgrind>	I bought my first computer and it had a Q6600
Feb 25 05:10:16 <CrtxReavr>	Got a fully loaded Sun Ultrasparc E450 - maxed out in ram & drives.
Feb 25 05:10:21 <NeXeN>	"i remember when people used myspace"
Feb 25 05:10:31 <Khaytsus>	CrtxReavr: Did they also install 240V for you to power it?
Feb 25 05:10:32 <CrtxReavr>	Didn't dare fire that thing up in my house. . . was a waiste.
Feb 25 05:10:34 <NeXeN>	oh yeah? have you ever heard of dialup BBSes?
Feb 25 05:10:37 <Ximo>	CrtxReavr: not bad
Feb 25 05:10:55 <Ximo>	right, flip it on fleabay
Feb 25 05:12:03 <espresso>	when key to AT&T backbones was a Cap'n Crunch cereal box whistle
Feb 25 05:12:21 <hodapp>	good thing AT&T's service is so much more stable now
Feb 25 05:12:31 <jamiahx2>	what does tar mean by a file shrank?
Feb 25 05:12:34 <CrtxReavr>	The actual AT&T or Southwest Bell renamed to AT&T?
Feb 25 05:13:06 <bane_killgrind>	"He told Bernes if he could find a way to connect cigarettes with the idea of challenging male power, then women would smoke. Because then they would have their own penises!"
Feb 25 05:13:07 <ayecee>	jamiahx2: what's the actual text of the message
Feb 25 05:13:19 <CrtxReavr>	I've done consulting work for AT&T and seen behind that curtain. . . I'm frankly amazed it works half as well as it does.
Feb 25 05:13:23 <jamiahx2>	`tar: /media/jamiahxecryptfs2/Downloads/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64-3.1.7.run: File shrank by 75055060 bytes; padding with zeros`
Feb 25 05:13:27 <bane_killgrind>	hodapp: this is great
Feb 25 05:14:10 <CrtxReavr>	'Course. . . I remember when AT&T Uverse had a two week long DHCP outage in this area.
Feb 25 05:14:16 <CrtxReavr>	I was so embarassed for them.
Feb 25 05:14:20 <espresso>	CrtxReavr: Ma Bell, with $150b (=$420 billion now) and 1M employees at the time of breakup
Feb 25 05:14:24 <ayecee>	jamiahx2: while compressing or decompressing
Feb 25 05:14:33 <NeXeN>	jamiahx2: well i'm not sure but it probably doesn't mean it got larger
Feb 25 05:14:49 <jamiahx2>	no compression; while appending into an archive
Feb 25 05:15:01 <CrtxReavr>	I mean. . . DHCP is a service you could literally pull a dusty old machine from under some secretary's desk, thow some free software on it, and serve. . . probably millions of homes with.
Feb 25 05:15:08 <CrtxReavr>	But to was literally down two weeks.
Feb 25 05:15:09 <jamiahx2>	copying off drive clone into archive
Feb 25 05:15:44 <ayecee>	the message means that a state() on the file reported a different size than the amount which could actually be read from the file.
Feb 25 05:15:50 <ayecee>	err, stat()
Feb 25 05:16:08 <hodapp>	I mostly remember the time I was having issues on Time Warner Cable, ran a traceroute, and saw the packet going in a circle.
Feb 25 05:16:13 <jamiahx2>	uhhhhh.... so that means it was an incompletely cloned file?
Feb 25 05:16:25 <CrtxReavr>	Route loops are not that uncommon.
Feb 25 05:16:34 <ayecee>	jamiahx2: seems like a reasonable interpretation
Feb 25 05:16:59 <hodapp>	CrtxReavr: their tech support tried to blame a squirrel...
Feb 25 05:17:00 <jamiahx2>	and dmesg has btrfs errors!
Feb 25 05:17:07 <bane_killgrind>	CrtxReavr you gotta pay the nerds enough
Feb 25 05:17:12 <jamiahx2>	whelp, at least it's only files I don't care about so far
Feb 25 05:17:15 <CrtxReavr>	Squirrels do chew on a lot of cables.
Feb 25 05:17:18 <ayecee>	whew
Feb 25 05:17:52 <bane_killgrind>	I will be extremely self serving and say that the nerds being undercompensated caused this
Feb 25 05:19:57 <NeXeN>	jamiahx2: ok, so the shrink thing means the filesize changed between the time tar started to archive it and by the time it finished
Feb 25 05:20:22 <NeXeN>	jamiahx2: so unless you are actually using the file at the moment, likely it's bad blocks
Feb 25 05:20:22 <jamiahx2>	that is odd
Feb 25 05:20:38 <NeXeN>	or is it an encrypted fs, by chance?
Feb 25 05:20:45 <jamiahx2>	ecryptfs
Feb 25 05:20:54 <NeXeN>	because encryption will cause the physical size to change from the decrypted size
Feb 25 05:21:06 <jamiahx2>	oh! I got a read error!
Feb 25 05:21:13 <jamiahx2>	(on a file I don't care about)
Feb 25 05:21:22 <NeXeN>	is that good news or bad?
Feb 25 05:21:44 <ayecee>	it's bad news that's mitigated by good news.
Feb 25 05:22:05 <jamiahx2>	bad omen I guess, since it means the file errors are real and I'm gonna have to deal with them
Feb 25 05:23:36 <NeXeN>	you might retry adding the bad files to the tar....if your controller is trippin' then it might be able to get a good read on subsequent tries
Feb 25 05:23:50 <NeXeN>	even if the nand is trippin, you might be able to get at the files
Feb 25 05:24:05 <jamiahx2>	this is off a clone of the bad drive
Feb 25 05:24:10 <ayecee>	i think jamiahx2 is reading these files from a cloned image
Feb 25 05:24:12 <NeXeN>	also, I would highly suggest swapping in a known working cable
Feb 25 05:24:15 <ayecee>	so it's not going to get any better.
Feb 25 05:24:32 <ayecee>	highly suggest, eh
Feb 25 05:24:33 <NeXeN>	oh yeah.....anyways, on the original machine, you might try the above solutions
Feb 25 05:24:39 <ayecee>	not just suggest, but _highly_ suggest
Feb 25 05:24:53 <rascul>	the highest
Feb 25 05:25:00 <jamiahx2>	alright
Feb 25 05:25:00 <NeXeN>	yeah, i've seen cables get snagged in the case and cause funky errors.....
Feb 25 05:25:28 <NeXeN>	i've also wrestled with a shiesty drive for hours and come to find out the cable was bad
Feb 25 05:25:38 <rascul>	who won?
Feb 25 05:25:44 <rascul>	the wrestling match
Feb 25 05:25:53 <SFaulken>	rascul:  you did!
Feb 25 05:25:57 <rascul>	yay!
Feb 25 05:25:57 <ayecee>	both got participation awards
Feb 25 05:26:15 *	rascul brings in a case of winner beer for everyone
Feb 25 05:26:33 <rascul>	umm, that case won't last long. here's a keg.
Feb 25 05:26:36 <jamiahx2>	patient drive and one of the clones are offline, if any files I care about fail then I'll be pulling more off the patient
Feb 25 05:26:46 <ayecee>	smart
Feb 25 05:26:47 <jamiahx2>	making a post-it about the cable now
Feb 25 05:27:13 <rascul>	cables are good until they aren't
Feb 25 05:27:25 <NeXeN>	it's a long shot but it does happen
Feb 25 05:27:59 <rascul>	if you've narrowed an issue down to a cable definitely don't put it back in the drawer with the other cables
Feb 25 05:28:17 <NeXeN>	happened alot more in the IDE days because people would bend those cables in contorted shapes trying to make a case look neat......like an idiot....ruin the cable to make it look pretty
Feb 25 05:28:29 <NeXeN>	rascul: i know, right?
Feb 25 05:28:31 <ayecee>	rascul has definitely done that before
Feb 25 05:28:33 <rascul>	eventually you could get those round ide cables though
Feb 25 05:28:36 <ayecee>	me too
Feb 25 05:29:00 <NeXeN>	i once had a floppy drive that would ruin floppies.....i finally figured it out and then threw it into a box of old floppy drives.....and it later came back to bite me in the ...
Feb 25 05:29:14 <rascul>	in the floppy?
Feb 25 05:29:27 <kfrench>	I hate it when people bite me in the floppy.
Feb 25 05:29:57 <rascul>	bitten floppies make a bunch of weird noises when i put the floppy in the slot
Feb 25 05:30:01 <jamiahx2>	lmao
Feb 25 05:30:01 <NeXeN>	I thought I had a hundred bad floppies, i went back to the store like three times to buy floppies and even cussed at the radio shack guy
Feb 25 05:30:32 <rascul>	i probably wouldn't have gone back to cuss at the radio shack guy three times
Feb 25 05:30:47 <solol>	what
Feb 25 05:30:51 <solol>	u really playing with floppies?
Feb 25 05:30:52 <rascul>	what
Feb 25 05:30:53 <NeXeN>	he was very smug
Feb 25 05:30:58 *	SFaulken cusses at rascul three times
Feb 25 05:31:12 *	rascul throws a basket of strawberries at SFaulken
Feb 25 05:31:19 <NeXeN>	solol: out of courtesy could you spell out "you" for us? text talk is frowned upon in IRC
Feb 25 05:31:28 <solol>	Zzzz
Feb 25 05:31:32 <solol>	It is not

Feb 25 05:31:35 <NeXeN>	some is allowed....like lol and stuff
Feb 25 05:31:36 <kfrench>	SFaulken: May you live in interesting times.
Feb 25 05:32:06 <rascul>	strawberries are wonderful
Feb 25 05:32:08 <NeXeN>	it's a very inconsistent rule that's applied consistently

Feb 25 05:35:37 <solol>	except centuries aren't decades
Feb 25 05:35:40 <scottpedia>	does a 4000x4000 image normally take around 120MB of data?
Feb 25 05:35:45 <solol>	Probably
Feb 25 05:35:50 <solol>	That's very big
Feb 25 05:35:57 <scottpedia>	i mean it's empty, just background color
Feb 25 05:36:05 <solol>	4k isn't that big and that's 4x 1080p.
Feb 25 05:36:14 <CrtxReavr>	Do the math. . . start with the color depth.
Feb 25 05:36:15 <ayecee>	well what's 4000 x 4000 x 4
Feb 25 05:36:29 <CrtxReavr>	4?
Feb 25 05:36:35 <CrtxReavr>	16 color mode?
Feb 25 05:36:38 <scottpedia>	CrtxReavr: color depth 8 bit rgb
Feb 25 05:36:40 <ayecee>	4 bytes.
Feb 25 05:36:47 <ayecee>	rgb plus alpha
Feb 25 05:36:55 <scottpedia>	no alpha i think
Feb 25 05:37:07 <ayecee>	don't matter. still 4 bytes.
Feb 25 05:37:36 <ayecee>	so anyhow i get 64 megabytes
Feb 25 05:37:39 <CrtxReavr>	so 4 bytes * 4000 * 4000
Feb 25 05:37:57 <scottpedia>	16000000 * 4 bytes
Feb 25 05:38:17 <scottpedia>	64000000 bytes = 64M bytes
Feb 25 05:38:28 <NeXeN>	well sort of, close
Feb 25 05:39:07 <NeXeN>	62.5 ....
Feb 25 05:39:28 <NeXeN>	scottpedia: how are you going about this? copy-pasting from libreoffice?
Feb 25 05:39:40 <NeXeN>	to or from gimp, per chance?
Feb 25 05:39:44 <scottpedia>	no it's an image that I create from the gimp
Feb 25 05:39:46 <NeXeN>	or is it an svg?
Feb 25 05:39:47 <solol>	~2x the size
Feb 25 05:39:59 <NeXeN>	ok, is it saved in gimp's format, xcf?
Feb 25 05:40:20 <scottpedia>	it's not even saved, i am just creating it and gimp warns me that it's too large
Feb 25 05:40:30 <NeXeN>	was it or is it an SVG?
Feb 25 05:41:02 <NeXeN>	anyways, gimp saves down alot of data so you can have undo and other stuff.....i suppose you haven't saved it yet, but it's preparing an xcf in memory...
Feb 25 05:41:06 <scottpedia>	idk. the gimp didn't prompt me to select a format
Feb 25 05:41:23 <scottpedia>	ohh okay i see
Feb 25 05:41:25 <NeXeN>	i don't know that the metadata would be 2x
Feb 25 05:41:46 <NeXeN>	but also, if you run some plugin or something, in memory you might be working on a copy so, 2x
Feb 25 05:41:48 <scottpedia>	and what does dpi mean?
Feb 25 05:41:52 <NeXeN>	dots per inch
Feb 25 05:41:55 <scottpedia>	or ppi whatever
Feb 25 05:42:02 <NeXeN>	it means nothing until you print on paper
Feb 25 05:42:18 <NeXeN>	though, it will change the scale on your ruler in gimp
Feb 25 05:42:38 <scottpedia>	i am confused because an image of a certain resolution should already have an determined size
Feb 25 05:43:03 <scottpedia>	why would there be something like ppi
Feb 25 05:43:10 <NeXeN>	what was the last thing you did before it b0rked out? ran a filter? script-fu?
Feb 25 05:43:23 <NeXeN>	pixels per inch....
Feb 25 05:43:37 <ayecee>	scottpedia: well how big is 100 pixels
Feb 25 05:43:42 <scottpedia>	no it didn't bork out, at least not completely
Feb 25 05:43:42 <NeXeN>	but any rasterized system will scale to it's resolution so an inch on screen is not the same as an inch on paper, necessarily
Feb 25 05:43:51 <scottpedia>	it just gave me a warning
Feb 25 05:44:09 <NeXeN>	ok, whether or not it b0rked or warned, the important part of the answer was what were you doing before you got the message?
Feb 25 05:44:17 <scottpedia>	so ppi wouldn't matter if I never plan to print it right?
Feb 25 05:44:46 <ayecee>	wrong.
Feb 25 05:44:52 <NeXeN>	the question could be what were you doing when jfk was assasinated....and it's not important whether or not he was assasinated or it was a conspiracy and he ran away to the grassy knoll....the important part was, what were you doing?
Feb 25 05:45:13 <ayecee>	NeXeN: you feeling okay?
Feb 25 05:45:15 <NeXeN>	ppi is often ignored by stuff like photoshop.....but in gimp it will change the scale of tools
Feb 25 05:45:17 <scottpedia>	NeXeN: just created an empty image at File->New
Feb 25 05:45:36 <NeXeN>	what did you set the dpi or ppi?
Feb 25 05:45:45 <scottpedia>	300
Feb 25 05:45:46 <JanC>	multiple layers?
Feb 25 05:45:51 <NeXeN>	try maybe 72?
Feb 25 05:45:56 <scottpedia>	ok
Feb 25 05:46:07 <JanC>	also, are you certain about the colours?
Feb 25 05:46:17 <scottpedia>	JanC: what colours?
Feb 25 05:46:25 <JanC>	colour depth
Feb 25 05:46:35 <scottpedia>	yeah 8-bit rgb
Feb 25 05:48:01 <CrtxReavr>	8-bit - ie 256 colors per pixel is one byte per pixel.
Feb 25 05:48:05 <NeXeN>	i think the correct algorithm is (X * y * bitsize)/8
Feb 25 05:48:06 <scottpedia>	anyways thx guys
Feb 25 05:48:09 <scottpedia>	i got it working
Feb 25 05:48:16 <NeXeN>	with 72 instead of 300?
Feb 25 05:48:19 <scottpedia>	but i still don't understand what ppi is
Feb 25 05:48:28 <NeXeN>	now, take note, you can scale it up to 300 dpi when you're ready
Feb 25 05:48:37 <scottpedia>	right
Feb 25 05:48:42 <ayecee>	CrtxReavr: only if the pixels are black and white
Feb 25 05:48:49 <CrtxReavr>	That's a monitor setting. .
Feb 25 05:48:50 <ayecee>	it's 8 bits per color.
Feb 25 05:48:55 <scottpedia>	is there a conversion between ppi and resolution?
Feb 25 05:49:06 <ayecee>	plus another 8 bits for alpha, or for padding.
Feb 25 05:49:11 <ayecee>	scottpedia: no
Feb 25 05:49:13 <NeXeN>	oh yeah that's right
Feb 25 05:49:27 <scottpedia>	like some printers have settings to print at a certain ppi. does that matter the actual thing that's printed on paper?
Feb 25 05:49:37 <ayecee>	scottpedia: yes
Feb 25 05:49:43 <CrtxReavr>	For 24-bit color depth, yes. . . 256 different values of redness, greenness, and blueness.
Feb 25 05:49:47 <JanC>	Gimp always has an alpha channel internally, of course, that's needed to work with layers
Feb 25 05:50:20 <scottpedia>	alright i see
Feb 25 05:50:36 <scottpedia>	so more ppi clearer the image on paper?
Feb 25 05:50:55 <scottpedia>	more sharp*
Feb 25 05:51:04 <NeXeN>	well it's the size
Feb 25 05:51:20 <ayecee>	let's keep it simple and say yes.
Feb 25 05:51:41 <NeXeN>	if you have 1000 pixels in a 2x2 inch square, it will seem sharper than 1000 pixels in a 4x4 inch square
Feb 25 05:51:57 <JanC>	ppi/dpi are just to calculate from dots/pixels to centimetres/inches
Feb 25 05:52:11 <scottpedia>	okay i see
Feb 25 05:52:38 <NeXeN>	you can't get any sharper than the actual number of pixels without some interpolation, and that really doesn't sharpen anything up....it will just be less chunky
Feb 25 05:52:42 <ayecee>	to take an image and scale it to a given physical size, on screen or on paper.
Feb 25 05:52:48 <NeXeN>	in fact, people would say it feels "softer" or "blurrier"
Feb 25 05:53:34 <NeXeN>	if you have 72x72 image and you print it at 72 dpi, then you will get a 1x1 inch image on paper
Feb 25 05:53:47 <JanC>	it's almost certainly not relevant for what you do anyway
Feb 25 05:53:59 <scottpedia>	ok i see
Feb 25 05:54:10 <scottpedia>	thx for your help guys NeXeN JanC
Feb 25 05:54:19 <NeXeN>	wait, i think i screwed that up by orders of magnitude
Feb 25 05:54:23 <ayecee>	but only if that image is encoded at 72 ppi
Feb 25 05:55:05 <NeXeN>	you can rescale the image, but you'll never gain anything.....it's easy to "lose" but not to gain
Feb 25 05:55:38 <NeXeN>	it'll look like some cheezy blown up image ....that's why you always want to scan at a high dpi if image quality matters.....but if it's not being scanned then the rasterizer will rescale as necessary
Feb 25 05:57:25 <NeXeN>	e.g. if it's just for a website, dpi matters not because screen real-estate is measured in pixels not inches.....so the image will naturally be whatever it is in pixels, not inches (hence dpi won't matter)
Feb 25 05:58:06 <NewLinuxU>	Hi Team, is there any cons to dual booting windows 11/ubuntu using two different hard drives on the same machine?
Feb 25 05:58:17 <scottpedia>	ok i see
Feb 25 05:58:26 <NeXeN>	NewLinuxU: win11 is always a con because of it's sleep mode/hibernate
Feb 25 05:58:26 <ayecee>	NewLinuxU: compared to what
Feb 25 05:58:36 <NeXeN>	but it won't matter to grub
Feb 25 05:58:55 <NewLinuxU>	so its a stable setup?
Feb 25 05:59:05 <NewLinuxU>	as in Windows won't eat linux at some stage
Feb 25 05:59:06 <ayecee>	what does it mean, stable setup
Feb 25 05:59:27 <ayecee>	okay, sure
Feb 25 05:59:33 <NewLinuxU>	I just mean, one day im not going to be able to boot into windows or ubuntu
Feb 25 05:59:34 <NeXeN>	scottpedia: i'm picking fictitous numbers because i don't want to look anything up...but if I had a 7 inch phone screen at say 1024x768....then i have a 24 inch monitor with 1024x768.....the image will appear to be many inches larger on the monitor....with the sameish sharpness
Feb 25 05:59:49 <NewLinuxU>	I am not explaining what I mean well.
Feb 25 06:00:03 <NewLinuxU>	Basically do they work nicely together?
Feb 25 06:00:07 <wbpayne>	NewLinuxU: If you want you can disable the hibernate feature by typing "powercfg /h off" at an administrator command prompt.
Feb 25 06:00:09 <ayecee>	NewLinuxU: if that happens, it won't be because of this setup in particular.
Feb 25 06:00:28 <scottpedia>	NewLinuxU: ok
Feb 25 06:00:35 <NewLinuxU>	ok thanks.
Feb 25 06:00:38 <scottpedia>	NewLinuxU: ok
Feb 25 06:00:39 <NeXeN>	scottpedia: if i take a screenshot of my background on the one screen and use it as my background on the other, it won't have any weird artifacts.....but if the resolutions were different, say 1024x768 and 1400x1290 or whatever, then anything from the larger screen to the smaller will be super sharp but vice versa the image will look digitally blown up with the chunky square artifacts
Feb 25 06:01:04 <scottpedia>	ok
Feb 25 06:01:10 <NeXeN>	but the physical inches on the screen will be different....because the standard is pixel not inch
Feb 25 06:01:12 <ayecee>	NewLinuxU: okay professor, lecture over.
Feb 25 06:01:13 <NewLinuxU>	To be honest, I keep Windows for my son to play Roblox, that is about it
Feb 25 06:01:17 <ayecee>	err.
Feb 25 06:01:19 <ayecee>	NeXeN.
Feb 25 06:01:21 <scottpedia>	NeXeN: thx for ur help man
Feb 25 06:01:29 <scottpedia>	i appreciate it
Feb 25 06:01:32 <NeXeN>	ayecee: i used to work in a print shop :^)
Feb 25 06:01:42 <NeXeN>	i had customers fret over it all the time
Feb 25 06:02:41 <NewLinuxU>	I have always used Windows but I firmly believe in open source the more I look into it
Feb 25 06:02:43 <CrtxReavr>	There's no linux roblox client?
Feb 25 06:03:14 <NewLinuxU>	Not that I could find
Feb 25 06:03:36 <NeXeN>	CrtxReavr: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/roblox-on-linux-everything-summarized-in-1-post/2215991
Feb 25 06:03:46 <NeXeN>	run it in wine
Feb 25 06:04:13 <CrtxReavr>	Wine, not that newer thing?
Feb 25 06:04:22 <ayecee>	sure, that newer thing too
Feb 25 06:04:34 <NewLinuxU>	What is the newer thing?
Feb 25 06:04:38 <CrtxReavr>	The steam thing. . . um. . .
Feb 25 06:04:42 <ayecee>	proton
Feb 25 06:04:48 <CrtxReavr>	Yes, Proton.
Feb 25 06:05:12 <NeXeN>	isn't proton just a wine fork?
Feb 25 06:05:16 <ayecee>	yes
Feb 25 06:06:01 <Sparkles>	I believe that an awesome example for what NeXeN meant is Star Trek Next Generation recorded on film and not tape. Re-recorded into digital media like 2160p of today makes it looking still great due to how that tech works scaling the resolution from analog to digital.
Feb 25 06:06:14 <NewLinuxU>	Completely off topic I just watched "Land of Bad" great movie
Feb 25 06:06:27 <NeXeN>	https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorial:Using_Roblox_on_Linux
Feb 25 06:06:31 <CrtxReavr>	Could use a better title.
Feb 25 06:06:53 <espresso>	I could never get ssl working with x11vnc. It's still trying to use md5 (which openssl now complains about), missing required -x509 option, I can read but not modify the generation scripts, and 'looking for a new maintainer' indeed.. Had as much trouble with xrdp too, but might try again
Feb 25 06:07:07 <NeXeN>	Sparkles: yeah, anything on analog can be upscaled to whatever resolution you want to sample it at
Feb 25 06:08:05 <ayecee>	kinda.
Feb 25 06:08:09 <NeXeN>	espresso: using -ssl options?
Feb 25 06:08:36 <NeXeN>	espresso: i've used it over ssh, incase that helps
Feb 25 06:09:10 <espresso>	NeXeN: yeah. sslGenCA + sslGenCert
Feb 25 06:09:36 <NeXeN>	if you just want encryption, you might try uhh....-vencrypt or -anontls
Feb 25 06:09:52 <Sparkles>	espresso, should be possible with openssl only. Is there a reason for custom programs?
Feb 25 06:09:53 <NeXeN>	any specific reason why you need that particular cert?
Feb 25 06:10:13 <espresso>	I think anontls was broken by TLS 1.3(?) handshake
Feb 25 06:10:53 <NeXeN>	espresso: have you tried -ssl SAVE?
Feb 25 06:11:11 <espresso>	Sparkles: those are options to x11vnc to generate them itself. I could try generating them myself again since I probably messed that up.
Feb 25 06:11:19 <NeXeN>	then x11vnc -ssl /home/dork/vnccert.pem?
Feb 25 06:11:58 <espresso>	NeXeN: I would need a .pem that it didn't error on
Feb 25 06:12:36 <espresso>	it gave one of the most uninformative errors ever
Feb 25 06:13:19 <NeXeN>	it b0rks out on the one generated by -ssl SAVE?
Feb 25 06:14:29 <espresso>	that seems to work, but is a temp one. that might do, just to save time and sanity
Feb 25 06:14:51 <NeXeN>	that's how i've ever done it or just use over ssh
Feb 25 06:15:10 <NeXeN>	ssh also compresses by the way so it might even feel faster
Feb 25 06:15:40 <espresso>	could be a nice bonus. thanks again
Feb 25 06:16:12 <NeXeN>	have you tried stunnel?
Feb 25 06:16:19 <espresso>	no
Feb 25 06:16:40 <NeXeN>	i know people who have vnc issues going from linux<->windows use stunnel
Feb 25 06:16:49 <NeXeN>	since it's supported in windows and linux....
Feb 25 06:19:15 <espresso>	I see it's using sha256. (and the generation options I was trying before are not oft-used, so maybe outdated). Just linux here, but things should now work smoothly enough
Feb 25 06:20:11 <NeXeN>	ssh -t -L 5900:localhost:5900 remote-machine 'x11vnc -localhost -display :0'    something like this for ssh tunnel
Feb 25 06:20:29 <NeXeN>	might have to fool with firewall
Feb 25 06:20:53 <espresso>	that looks like a good option to note
Feb 25 06:21:09 <NeXeN>	sudo ufw allow 5900/tcp    in ubuntu
Feb 25 06:21:32 <NeXeN>	not sure about firewalld.....something like firewall-cmd --add-service=vnc-server
Feb 25 06:21:46 <espresso>	I would edit my nftables service table
Feb 25 06:23:38 <buraq>	with firewalld you don't directly command nftables
Feb 25 06:23:41 <NeXeN>	yeah, best to do something like that.....unless your company provides certs you have to use....
Feb 25 06:24:23 <Sparkles>	espresso, just in case, with such a tunnel the speed may significantly got affected by the tunnel due to how SSH works.
Feb 25 06:24:43 <NeXeN>	espresso: are you using a PKCS bundle by chance?
Feb 25 06:24:44 <espresso>	though I have found firewalld and ufw useful before, I'm just managing an nftables script atm
Feb 25 06:24:44 <Sparkles>	Pure VNC may be faster, or, at least, use something more fast like proxy or VPN.
Feb 25 06:25:04 <NeXeN>	i think that's how windows generates them by default?
Feb 25 06:25:48 <buraq>	NeXeN: you can run a command directly when you create a ssh tunnel?
Feb 25 06:26:24 <espresso>	NeXeN: I was generating them separately but did come across the notion of bundling
Feb 25 06:28:07 <NeXeN>	buraq: see the example i posted above
Feb 25 06:28:19 <NeXeN>	or the ssh manpage :P
Feb 25 06:28:50 <buraq>	NeXeN: so the answer is yes?
Feb 25 06:29:39 <espresso>	'hostname does not match the server certificate' a disadvantage of auto-generated certs :/
Feb 25 06:31:03 <Sparkles>	Not really.
Feb 25 06:31:04 <NeXeN>	buraq: even if not specifying a command, you will still execute sshd upon tunnel creation
Feb 25 06:31:14 <NeXeN>	so the answer is not only yes, but always
Feb 25 06:31:16 <Sparkles>	You can create any kind of self-generated cert.
Feb 25 06:31:37 <Sparkles>	A hostname mismatch means the cert was incorrectly generated.
Feb 25 06:31:50 <NeXeN>	what did you type in when you created it?
Feb 25 06:31:56 <NeXeN>	maybe you need to be creating it on the other box?
Feb 25 06:32:03 <espresso>	no, it's self-signed so that's expected. and generating my own goes back to all the previous issues I had
Feb 25 06:32:10 <Sparkles>	It's not expected.
Feb 25 06:32:21 <Sparkles>	You can create any kind of cert at all. Like, literally.
Feb 25 06:32:42 <espresso>	I mean, when vnc auto-generates them and I can't use the correct info
Feb 25 06:32:49 <Sparkles>	The only thing what you cannot is signing with keys you don't own.
Feb 25 06:32:51 <NeXeN>	espresso: are you using NAT?
Feb 25 06:33:11 <espresso>	NeXeN: er, no
Feb 25 06:33:38 <NeXeN>	espresso: did you specify localhost or 127.0.0.1 or ?
Feb 25 06:34:46 <espresso>	I'm not sure where I could specify that, when it's all done automatically by -ssl SAVE.
Feb 25 06:34:55 <NeXeN>	I thought it walks you through creation?
Feb 25 06:36:16 <NeXeN>	espresso: so....try generating the cert exactly as x11vnc did.....sha256 and all that
Feb 25 06:36:20 <Sparkles>	What does it show for: `openssl x509 -noout -subject -in ./cert.pem -nameopt multiline`?
Feb 25 06:36:26 <espresso>	not -ssl.  -sslGenCA or -sslGenCert do
Feb 25 06:36:57 <NeXeN>	good idea Sparkles
Feb 25 06:37:23 <NeXeN>	see what the hostname actually is....maybe need to generate on the other machine
Feb 25 06:38:31 <korn3r>	anyone know app that has translations to multiple languages and has word "Administration" in it? i want to make default xdg menu fully translated, but it lacks translation for "administration" application menu
Feb 25 06:39:07 <espresso>	vnc isn't exactly telling me how it's doing it. I could surmise some of it
Feb 25 06:39:30 <Sparkles>	espresso, if you need to generate a custom SSL cert. I can help you writing a fast script for it if required.
Feb 25 06:39:39 <NeXeN>	yeah....but i like sparkles' idea.....try to find out what host it's generating
Feb 25 06:40:15 <jamiahx2>	I'm getting some odd behavior
Feb 25 06:40:24 <espresso>	I was generating certs myself, but possibly didn't get the right one to it..
Feb 25 06:40:56 <espresso>	Sparkles: like: openssl req -x509 -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -outform PEM -sha256 -nodes -subj "/CN=rp" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:rp,IP:10.0.0.2"
Feb 25 06:41:00 <NeXeN>	it could be that x11vnc has some funky version of openssl statically linked? maybe try some really vanilla cert
Feb 25 06:41:09 <jamiahx2>	I'm not able to append to the archive anymore, and tar seems to be asking for an option of one of`Acdrtux`
Feb 25 06:41:43 <buraq>	NeXeN: i have never ran a command at the time when i create a -L ssh tunnel
Feb 25 06:41:57 <NeXeN>	jamiahx2: tar only accepts those letters or a long name
Feb 25 06:42:20 <jamiahx2>	long name?
Feb 25 06:42:27 <NeXeN>	buraq: i was being facetious....
Feb 25 06:42:32 <NeXeN>	like --long-flag
Feb 25 06:42:52 <buraq>	NeXeN: i don't know that word
Feb 25 06:42:52 <NeXeN>	in other words, what did you pass to tar?
Feb 25 06:42:55 <jamiahx2>	I have `sudo tar --preserve-permissions --same-owner --acls --selinux --xattrs --append -f /media/server/jamiahx-rescue.tar /media/jamiahxecryptfs2/evelauncher`
Feb 25 06:43:02 <jamiahx2>	so it should be appending...
Feb 25 06:43:02 <NeXeN>	buraq: i was making a pedantic joke
Feb 25 06:43:44 <buraq>	buraq: i don't understand why you would joke about a ssh tunnel
Feb 25 06:44:32 <NeXeN>	NeXeN: is that dude really talking to his self? weirdo!
Feb 25 06:44:51 <buraq>	NeXeN: i don't understand why you would joke about a ssh tunnel
Feb 25 06:44:55 <Sparkles>	espresso, it seems it compares VNC "server name" with the cert's hostname.
Feb 25 06:45:05 <jamiahx2>	the last append exited with an error, but it seemed to append what I wanted it to
Feb 25 06:45:13 <NeXeN>	jamiahx2: short switches can be combined ....those beginning with - .....you don't need to preceede with - ....that's why it says the letters must be Acdrtux ...one of those letters
Feb 25 06:45:20 <Sparkles>	i.e. https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc/blob/e9d78517c90f393a5f5c420d6543b958d2b31032/common/rfb/CSecurityTLS.cxx#L373
Feb 25 06:46:54 <Sparkles>	And then the error slightly re-phrases it in this "Tiger" client: https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc/blob/e9d78517c90f393a5f5c420d6543b958d2b31032/common/rfb/CSecurityTLS.cxx#L515
Feb 25 06:46:58 <NeXeN>	jamiahx2: you need a command before --preserve-permissions
Feb 25 06:47:06 <NeXeN>	look at the manpage and the ordering of arguments
Feb 25 06:47:30 <espresso>	Sparkles: right. the x11vnc docs do mention in '-sslGenCA' that if you use the FQDN  as 'CommonName' you can avoid the complaint
Feb 25 06:47:39 <NeXeN>	or spell out --append
Feb 25 06:47:56 <buraq>	NeXeN: ?
Feb 25 06:48:25 <NeXeN>	buraq: a tunnel quite naturally executes sshd.....so you're always executing a command whether you specify it or not
Feb 25 06:48:34 <NeXeN>	hence, the joke....
Feb 25 06:48:35 <Sparkles>	Apparently, there's #vnc on Libera, and sure there's #openssl.
Feb 25 06:48:48 <jamiahx2>	`sudo tar -rvf /media/server/jamiahx-rescue.tar --preserve-permissions --same-owner --acls --selinux --xattrs /media/jamiahxecryptfs2/evelauncher`
Feb 25 06:48:51 <jamiahx2>	nope
Feb 25 06:48:54 <Sparkles>	I would check the source code of both and strace if something odd happens.
Feb 25 06:49:03 <buraq>	NeXeN: i'm talking about the example you gave of running x11vnc at the same time when you create the -L tunnel
Feb 25 06:49:13 <espresso>	Sparkles: but I see no obvious way to supply the hostname without going through the elaborate (outdated?) sslGenCA process. I tried #vnc for a bit..  Can live with the warning or do stunnel
Feb 25 06:49:22 <NeXeN>	buraq: try it and see?
Feb 25 06:49:43 <NeXeN>	it only costs one try
Feb 25 06:50:01 <buraq>	NeXeN: -L means it creates the tunnel at the client end not the server end
Feb 25 06:50:34 <Sparkles>	espresso, I am not sure why "CA" or "certificate authority" is required here. CA is usually used to sign certs for trust purposes and not create those for actual usage.
Feb 25 06:51:02 <Sparkles>	So, there's probably an additional cert is used for the connection, and the CA is stored on the VNC side.
Feb 25 06:51:06 <espresso>	Sparkles: I may have meant sslGenCert process
Feb 25 06:51:30 <jamiahx2>	https://pastebin.com/XuPmwcNK
Feb 25 06:51:36 <Sparkles>	I see!
Feb 25 06:51:48 <jamiahx2>	could the last append failing on some files be preventing further operation?
Feb 25 06:52:14 *	NeXeN goes to sleep
Feb 25 06:52:26 <buraq>	bye
Feb 25 06:52:29 <Sparkles>	There's "sslCertInfo" apparently.
Feb 25 06:53:25 <rascul>	jamiahx2 what are you trying to do with that tar command?
Feb 25 06:53:42 <jamiahx2>	the one I linked was to diff just to test it
Feb 25 06:54:07 <jamiahx2>	on a directory I know succeeded
Feb 25 06:54:23 <rascul>	oh i see now you did another one with -r
Feb 25 06:54:27 <rascul>	what was the error?
Feb 25 06:54:42 <jamiahx2>	no error, wouldn't actually start
Feb 25 06:55:10 <jamiahx2>	even used the same append command and flags that previously worked
Feb 25 06:55:21 <Larotin>	Hello, I tried installing debian testing on a flash drive for portability reasons, After I installed the kernel, the /etc/ folder vanished for some reason, how can I regenerate the folder without issues or re-installing every package on the system?
Feb 25 06:55:55 <Sparkles>	espresso, it seems this is what it uses: https://github.com/LibVNC/x11vnc/blob/a61f364e385d98677c04070a994397b287385219/src/sslcmds.c#L611
Feb 25 06:56:25 <Sparkles>	The script itself is: https://github.com/LibVNC/x11vnc/blob/a61f364e385d98677c04070a994397b287385219/src/ssltools.h#L369
Feb 25 06:56:40 <rascul>	jamiahx2 it wouldn't start and there was no error?
Feb 25 06:56:48 <jamiahx2>	correct
Feb 25 06:57:01 <bane_killgrind>	night NeXeN
Feb 25 06:57:14 <jamiahx2>	https://pastebin.com/dK3cTVjk
Feb 25 06:57:16 <espresso>	Sparkles: aha.. I knew they were hardcoded xD I could rebuild it stronger, better, faster.. or at least two of those
Feb 25 06:57:33 <rascul>	jamiahx2 what was the next line?
Feb 25 06:57:48 <jamiahx2>	okay, sysmon shows network activity.....
Feb 25 06:57:58 <jamiahx2>	just the terminal's prompt
Feb 25 06:58:05 <rascul>	so then it succeeded
Feb 25 06:58:29 <jamiahx2>	is it just taking forever to append now?
Feb 25 06:58:50 <rascul>	it finished when you got the prompt
Feb 25 06:59:12 <espresso>	Sparkles: thanks, useful info. I feel well-armed and happy to set that aside a while :)
Feb 25 06:59:15 <jamiahx2>	oh, I manually canceled it with `^C`
Feb 25 06:59:25 <rascul>	then you stopped it mid way
Feb 25 06:59:36 <jamiahx2>	appears so?
Feb 25 06:59:50 <rascul>	hopefully you didn't screw it up
Feb 25 07:00:02 <jamiahx2>	network says reading at 8MiB/s, practically no writing
Feb 25 07:00:11 <rascul>	can maybe try doing the same thing again and not hitting ^C
Feb 25 07:00:16 <jamiahx2>	wait.... is it manually reading the archive until the end to append it
Feb 25 07:00:25 <rascul>	it's not doing anything if you stopped it
Feb 25 07:00:34 <rascul>	because you stopped it
Feb 25 07:00:52 <jamiahx2>	I started it again and it's been running for the past 3 minutes
Feb 25 07:01:00 <rascul>	what does network have to do with it?
Feb 25 07:01:16 <Larotin>	guys...
Feb 25 07:01:19 <jamiahx2>	just because it's not writing to archive.... it's reading
Feb 25 07:01:27 <rascul>	how do you know?
Feb 25 07:01:34 <rascul>	you didn't even use -v did you?
Feb 25 07:01:44 <jamiahx2>	network recieving 8.0 MiB/s
Feb 25 07:01:48 <rascul>	what does network have to do with it?
Feb 25 07:02:00 <jamiahx2>	oh, the archive is on a server
Feb 25 07:02:04 <rascul>	ok?
Feb 25 07:02:58 <Sparkles>	Just in case, have you tried https://guacamole.apache.org/ or https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/ , espresso? Those both are self-hosted remote access alternatives. The first supports multiple protocols, including RDP.
Feb 25 07:03:12 <jamiahx2>	on `tar --append` it is reading 8 MiB/s from the archive
Feb 25 07:03:30 <jamiahx2>	and not writing out to the archive
Feb 25 07:03:33 <rascul>	you are doing this on the client?
Feb 25 07:03:36 <rascul>	or the server?
Feb 25 07:03:48 <jamiahx2>	on the client
Feb 25 07:03:58 <kurahaupo>	If the archive is compressed then yes, it has to read it first
Feb 25 07:04:14 <jamiahx2>	no compression; cannot append to compressed archives
Feb 25 07:04:37 <Sparkles>	RustDesk seems to be using their custom protocol if I am not mistaken. I did not see RDP/VNC but just TCP and rendezvous on their docs.
Feb 25 07:04:50 <Sparkles>	i.e. https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/wiki/How-does-RustDesk-work%3F
Feb 25 07:05:20 <kurahaupo>	Some compression methods allow for restart markers, but tar doesn't know about those and can't use them
Feb 25 07:05:40 <buraq>	Larotin: you installed some other kernel other than what comes with debian?
Feb 25 07:05:52 <jamiahx2>	ah
Feb 25 07:06:02 <Larotin>	buraq: yes, I installed xanmod
Feb 25 07:06:29 <Larotin>	buraq: through their repos
Feb 25 07:06:31 <buraq>	Larotin: you probably can't regenerate /etc as it was on the usb stick
Feb 25 07:06:47 <espresso>	Sparkles: interesting.. will check those out.
Feb 25 07:07:10 <buraq>	Larotin: actually i'm 100% sure
Feb 25 07:07:37 <Larotin>	buraq: so, I need to re-debootstrap, what caused this?
Feb 25 07:07:53 <jamiahx2>	ohhhhhhh, I think it's reading the 25GB tar for file collisions? maybe?
Feb 25 07:08:26 <buraq>	Larotin: you can also just install it normally on the usb stick
Feb 25 07:08:41 <buraq>	Larotin: i have no idea how it disappeared
Feb 25 07:09:42 <Larotin>	buraq: It takes forever if i used the debian-installer, I NEED to know what happened to not re-produce this error.
Feb 25 07:10:22 <buraq>	Larotin: yea well i need to wake up every morning. try #debian
Feb 25 07:11:08 <Larotin>	Ok, thanks buraq
Feb 25 07:11:53 <shan>	hi guys
Feb 25 07:11:57 <buraq>	Larotin: sorry i couldn't help you
Feb 25 07:12:54 <Larotin>	buraq: It's ok, hopefully #debian people will help me.
Feb 25 07:12:55 <buraq>	Larotin: for usb stick debian, you might want to disable the swap and setup fstab for noatime,nodiratime
Feb 25 07:13:43 <Larotin>	buraq: I didn't use swap, I didn't know about noatime,nodirtime .
Feb 25 07:14:12 <buraq>	Larotin: they're used so the filesystem doesn't record access times
Feb 25 07:14:33 <Larotin>	buraq: will that (hopefully) make the installation much faster? (on btrfs)
Feb 25 07:15:29 <buraq>	Larotin: probably not MUCH faster
Feb 25 07:16:14 <Larotin>	buraq: at least usable, installing the kernel took about 2 hrs.
Feb 25 07:17:40 <buraq>	Larotin: installing or compiling it?
Feb 25 07:18:28 <Larotin>	buraq: installing it through apt.
Feb 25 07:18:32 *	espresso uses noatime, thinking it can only help a bit
Feb 25 07:25:25 <shan>	https://imgur.com/a/J76ZJLt i'm trying to set up this 3.5" display with my raspberry pi. Setting fbcon=font:ProFont6x11 on the kernel cmdline makes the text really nice and easy to read but only while the display is in portrait (see image). is there a way to make it like that but in landscape mode?
Feb 25 07:27:59 <Larotin>	I really need a way to make debian faster on the flash drive, portable linux is something that can really come in handy...
Feb 25 07:33:00 <shan>	i also tried using vga8x8 but no luck
Feb 25 07:33:12 <jamiahx2>	okay.... yeah it's tar reading all the way to the end to sequentially append
Feb 25 07:35:31 <Larotin>	guess I'm going to reinstall debian on a hard-disk
Feb 25 07:38:42 <espresso>	..I was about to post more tips for using flash drive, but going to HD seems the best one to me :P
Feb 25 07:39:13 <buraq>	he left :(
Feb 25 07:39:32 <buraq>	i would never even try compiling the kernel on a usb stick
Feb 25 07:44:24 <espresso>	shan: /boot/firmware/config.txt  http://rptl.io/configtxt there should be some ways to rotate.
Feb 25 07:45:03 <shan>	espresso: rotating the display isnt the problem, i want the font to look nice when the display is in landscape
Feb 25 07:46:33 <espresso>	shan: ah, I see now
Feb 25 07:46:48 <shan>	mhm
Feb 25 07:52:19 <espresso>	I have the Pi 4b (the VNC server btw) USB-adapted to just an external 3.5" scsi ripped from a laptop
Feb 25 08:31:16 <Scissors>	hi all! how to re-mount / to be read-only, and save changes in RAM (via mount overlay)? I use sudo mount -t overlay  overlay -oloverdir=/,upperdir=/mnt/,workdir=/mnt/workdir / , but it tells me overlayfs: unrecognized mount option "loverdir=/" or missing value
Feb 25 08:31:58 <rascul>	"mount -o remount,ro /" to remount / read-only but i dunno the rest
Feb 25 08:32:58 <Scissors>	rascul: already done; I wanna to imitate rw, but on read-only fs;
Feb 25 08:35:26 *	Scissors have a fs-in-RAM, mounted at /mnt, rw, and /, ro; how to merge it into one / ? 
Feb 25 08:36:43 <buraq>	Scissors: you lover man
Feb 25 08:38:16 <Scissors>	buraq: ?
Feb 25 08:41:15 <buraq>	Scissors: you mis-spelled lower
Feb 25 08:41:30 <Scissors>	sudo mount -t overlay   ext4 -oremount,loverdir=/dev/zram0,upperdir=/dev/sdaX,workdir=/mnt/workdir /
Feb 25 08:41:39 <Scissors>	buraq: !! thanks :)
Feb 25 08:42:08 <Elladan>	If you're using a debian based distro there's a package to set up overlay root for you ("overlayroot") though I havne't used it.
Feb 25 08:43:13 <Scissors>	Elladan: Unable to locate package overlayroot
Feb 25 08:43:25 <Scissors>	sudo mount -t overlay  overlay -oremount,lowerdir=/mnt,upperdir=/,workdir=/mnt/workdir /
Feb 25 08:43:47 <Scissors>	EXT4-fs (sdaX): Unrecognized mount option "lowerdir=/mnt" or missing value
Feb 25 08:44:01 <buraq>	Scissors: sorry if i assumed your sex wrong
Feb 25 08:44:21 <Scissors>	buraq: :)
Feb 25 08:45:20 <Elladan>	Scissors, BTW to remount / ro, you can't have any files on / open read-write. In practice this is kinda annoying and basically means you need to drop to a very low single user mode, or do this in your initramfs.
Feb 25 08:45:58 <Elladan>	... so some kind of package to set this up for your distro is probably a lot easier than doing it yourself.
Feb 25 08:46:27 <Scissors>	Elladan: already ro fs
Feb 25 08:47:10 <Scissors>	Elladan: already mounted ro; already I have /dev/zram0 formatted as ext4fs; and I don't know how to merge them into /
Feb 25 08:47:39 <Scissors>	probably mount -- bind?
Feb 25 08:47:52 <Scissors>	mount --loop?
Feb 25 08:48:20 <rascul>	none of those will do what you want
Feb 25 08:48:32 <rascul>	they don't do overlay things
Feb 25 08:48:58 <Elladan>	A bind mount is a way to mount an existing mount point or directory somewhere else. A loop mount is a shortcut to using a file as a block device.
Feb 25 08:49:01 <rascul>	there exist fancy overlay filesystem things but i know nothing about them except that they exist
Feb 25 08:49:51 <buraq>	rascul: isn't that what -t overlay is? i used aufs earlier for the same purpose
Feb 25 08:50:07 <rascul>	i'm not the one to ask that
Feb 25 08:50:13 <Scissors>	buraq: how?
Feb 25 08:50:45 <Scissors>	buraq: there is nothing about aufs in man mount :(
Feb 25 08:52:04 <buraq>	Scissors: it's an earlier version/software for the overlaying
Feb 25 08:52:27 <rascul>	looks like kernel has overlayfs in tree but i don't know if that's relevant here
Feb 25 08:52:42 <Elladan>	I actually haven't used overlayfs directly, but it is what you want here.
Feb 25 08:52:55 <Scissors>	buraq: how can I use it? what command I need to type?
Feb 25 08:53:41 <Scissors>	rascul: it means that kernel supports overlayfs; (it may or may not be true for ancient kernels and/or weird distros)
Feb 25 08:54:15 <rascul>	yes, i know that much
Feb 25 08:54:31 <Elladan>	I found a script to set one up on a Raspberry Pi, and as I expected it was kind of complex. In particular they mounted root and the overlay in /mnt, used the mount -t overlay to put them together, and then used pivot_root
Feb 25 08:54:35 <buraq>	Scissors: if you don't have it, then use overlayfs
Feb 25 08:54:44 <buraq>	Scissors: it's the newer solution
Feb 25 08:54:56 <Elladan>	BTW is your overlayfs module loaded?
Feb 25 08:55:24 <Scissors>	Elladan: lsmod|grep overlay: yes
Feb 25 08:56:22 <Scissors>	Elladan: please paste line here, where it mount -t overlayfs options?
Feb 25 08:58:52 <Elladan>	mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=/mnt/lower,upperdir=/mnt/rw/upper,workdir=/mnt/rw/work overlayfs-root /mnt/newroot
Feb 25 09:00:14 <Elladan>	... followed by a bunch of other stuff, a pivot_root and a chroot.
Feb 25 09:01:01 <Scissors>	overlayfs: '/dev/zram0' not a directory
Feb 25 09:01:10 <Scissors>	overlayfs: upper fs is r/o, try multi-lower layers mount
Feb 25 09:01:18 <Elladan>	You overlay a filesystem, not a block device.
Feb 25 09:01:34 <Scissors>	sudo mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=/dev/zram0,upperdir=/,workdir=/mnt/workdir overlayfs-root /
Feb 25 09:01:54 <Scissors>	sudo mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=/mnt,upperdir=/,workdir=/mnt/workdir overlayfs-root /
Feb 25 09:03:05 <Elladan>	In the example I found, they don't use overlayfs to shadow / directly like you're doing. They create a new melded mount at a new mount point and then use pivot_root.
Feb 25 09:05:20 <Scissors>	sudo mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=/,upperdir=/mnt,workdir=/mnt/workdir overlayfs-root /
Feb 25 09:05:28 <Scissors>	overlayfs: workdir and upperdir must be separate subtrees
Feb 25 09:05:54 <Scissors>	sudo mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=/,upperdir=/mnt,workdir=/ overlayfs-root /
Feb 25 09:06:00 <Scissors>	overlayfs: workdir and upperdir must reside under the same mount
Feb 25 09:06:23 *	Scissors surrender completely :(
Feb 25 09:07:40 <buraq>	that's a good song
Feb 25 09:09:20 <buraq>	by rainbow
Feb 25 09:12:45 <Scissors>	buraq: ?
Feb 25 09:13:34 <buraq>	they have a song "i surrender"
Feb 25 09:14:07 <buraq>	Scissors: google for the error message and sleep on it. maybe the solution could appear tomorrow
Feb 25 09:16:12 <Scissors>	buraq: ok
Feb 25 09:16:44 <buraq>	Scissors: what is the / mount and what is the /mnt mount ?
Feb 25 09:17:12 <buraq>	oh it says workdir and upperdir
Feb 25 09:17:18 <buraq>	not lowerdir and upperdir
Feb 25 09:17:26 <Gamah>	i extended the virtual disk for a vm, but i can't seem to figure out how to extend the filesystem/lvm in ubuntu
Feb 25 09:17:45 <Gamah>	parted says it extended something but lvextend says it's the same size
Feb 25 09:18:19 <Scissors>	buraq: / is the actual (hda) gnu/linux fs, mounted as read-only; /mnt - is a /dev/zram0 (RAM  disk, with ext4 ilesystem on it)
Feb 25 09:18:32 <buraq>	Gamah: was your kernel able to re-read the partition table?
Feb 25 09:18:42 <Gamah>	hm, i'll reboot it
Feb 25 09:19:24 <buraq>	Scissors: you can use zram for data storage?
Feb 25 09:20:02 <Scissors>	buraq: I can store changes into it (of course, up to reboot only, - but it's ok)
Feb 25 09:21:34 <buraq>	Scissors: i read the error message wrong first. it talks about workdir and upperdir. in your last command workdir is / but upperdir is /mnt and you said it's zram
Feb 25 09:22:04 <buraq>	Scissors: sorry i haven't used overlayfs before, just aufs
Feb 25 09:22:49 <Scissors>	buraq: can you tell me how you used aufs?  (I try)
Feb 25 09:23:23 <buraq>	Scissors: no it was years ago but it was basically the same
Feb 25 09:23:43 <buraq>	Scissors: i wrote a document about it. i can try to see if i can find it
Feb 25 09:24:31 <Scissors>	buraq: are you developer of some project? wow
Feb 25 09:24:45 <buraq>	Scissors: no just a sysadmin
Feb 25 09:25:01 <Scissors>	buraq: what distro? redhat?
Feb 25 09:25:32 <buraq>	Scissors: most of them
Feb 25 09:26:49 <Gamah>	buraq: i was able to resize the /dev/sda partition but i think i'm doing something wrong with extending the lvm
Feb 25 09:27:11 <buraq>	Scissors: lol i found it :) the document
Feb 25 09:27:19 <Gamah>	parted /dev/sda; print shows the disk the correct size (20gb), but the filesystem is still 12gb
Feb 25 09:29:06 <buraq>	i've forgotten so much of this
Feb 25 09:29:15 <buraq>	10 years ago
Feb 25 09:29:16 <Gamah>	same and everything i'm googling isn't working :(
Feb 25 09:30:05 <buraq>	no i meant the filesystem overlaying with aufs
Feb 25 09:30:09 <Gamah>	ah
Feb 25 09:32:27 <buraq>	Scissors: i doubt this will help you. it's for a bit different purpose and it's different software and options but here it is: https://i.imgur.com/DAZV1at.png
Feb 25 09:32:48 <buraq>	Scissors: it's for only /etc and /var and the rest of the os came from a nfs server
Feb 25 09:34:45 <Gamah>	hm, pvresize and then lvresie okay i got it
Feb 25 09:34:56 <Gamah>	thanks Gamah
Feb 25 09:35:04 <Gamah>	no problem man :)
Feb 25 09:36:19 <buraq>	you the men, gamah!
Feb 25 09:36:25 <eqw>	I want to create many small LVM physical volumes on the same SSD. So it would make me flexible: I won't use pvresize because pvresize moves only the end of PV and not the beginning on PV. I just remove some PV's when I want to use disk space for non-LVM stuff. What do you think?
Feb 25 10:20:50 <NyB>	eqw: sounds painful. I would seriously evaluate the probability of doing "non-LVM stuff", esp. more than one of those at the same time.
Feb 25 10:21:39 <sameklu>	hi
Feb 25 10:21:42 <luna_>	hey
Feb 25 10:22:38 <NyB>	eqw: making permanent changes to a system to accommodate future experiments never really paid off for me. I almost never did those experiments, so I had a messy setup to prepare for things I didn't do
Feb 25 10:24:14 <NyB>	eqw: for this particular case, I'd just leave some unused space at the end. If you need the space you can expand the PV. And it'll be there for any experiments.
Feb 25 10:34:00 <Tanish>	VoidLinux: Is there a way to rebuild xbps pkgdb (/var/db/xbps/pkgdb-0.38.plist) if it got corrupted (to a non recoverable state)?
Feb 25 10:39:19 <xx>	oh wow where was this all my life? https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron
Feb 25 10:39:37 <xx>	did everyone else know about it and just keep it from me? or is there a more typical tool to use?
Feb 25 10:39:38 <buraq>	omnomnom says the cat
Feb 25 10:39:44 <buraq>	everyone else knew
Feb 25 10:39:48 <xx>	damn it
Feb 25 10:42:41 <buraq>	groin would've been a funnier name
Feb 25 10:44:03 <xx>	it's rare that I come across a tool and ask "where was this all my life???" and this so far looks like one of those
Feb 25 10:44:05 <cadmio>	hello
Feb 25 10:44:13 <luna_>	hey
Feb 25 10:44:18 <cadmio>	I need to increase the volume with they '+' key
Feb 25 10:44:41 <Sparkles>	In where, cadmio?
Feb 25 10:44:58 <Sparkles>	In some kind of user program, desktop environment, terminal etc.?
Feb 25 10:48:32 <cadmio>	in linux
Feb 25 10:48:40 <cadmio>	I mean system volume
Feb 25 10:49:04 <Sparkles>	I see. In what interface?
Feb 25 10:49:11 <Sparkles>	Globally? Like, always?
Feb 25 10:49:32 <Sparkles>	You press "+" and the system volume must be increased in anywhere?
Feb 25 10:50:13 <cadmio>	yes
Feb 25 10:50:19 <cadmio>	and - the opposite
Feb 25 10:50:39 <Sparkles>	What is the distribution?
Feb 25 10:51:16 <cadmio>	debian
Feb 25 10:52:29 <eqw>	NyB: "for this particular case, I'd just leave some unused space at the end." No, not for this particular case. It is a laptop with pre-installed Windows10 which is at the beginning of the disk. In case I ever use Windows I keep it at the beginning of the disk and decrease its partition but probably will increase the windows partition in the future.
Feb 25 10:54:11 <Sparkles>	cadmio, there's a guide for xmodmap: https://wiki.debian.org/Keyboard/MultimediaKeys
Feb 25 10:54:16 <Sparkles>	Some use https://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html

Feb 25 11:08:08 <genericum>	Is there a simple way to connect 2 boxes behind nat via SSH ?
Feb 25 11:09:06 <Gamah>	genericum: port forwarding or reverse shell
Feb 25 11:09:50 <genericum>	Gamah won't get my provider to forward a port
Feb 25 11:10:20 <Gamah>	reverse shell is your only option then really
Feb 25 11:11:12 <Sparkles>	What do you mean by provider? ISP? How would they see the forwarding over SSH?
Feb 25 11:11:37 <Gamah>	some isp's use gcnat
Feb 25 11:11:44 <buraq>	genericum: use tailscale
Feb 25 11:11:48 <Gamah>	cgnat*
Feb 25 11:12:29 <korn3r>	how cgnat supposed to help you?
Feb 25 11:12:52 <Gamah>	it doesn't it hurts you
Feb 25 11:12:55 <Sparkles>	How CGNat is even realted to the SSH tunnel issue?
Feb 25 11:12:55 <Gamah>	because your nat is a double nat
Feb 25 11:13:02 <Sparkles>	related*
Feb 25 11:13:04 <Gamah>	you can't ssh into something behind cgnat
Feb 25 11:13:20 <Gamah>	cause you can't make them forward the port for you
Feb 25 11:13:39 <Sparkles>	Excuse me?
Feb 25 11:13:45 <Sparkles>	It's the same SSH connection.
Feb 25 11:13:56 <Gamah>	how do you the client know how to reach the server?
Feb 25 11:13:57 <Sparkles>	1 port. 1 address. 1 connection.
Feb 25 11:14:09 <Sparkles>	They say they have SSH connection, is that correct?
Feb 25 11:14:30 <Gamah>	i think the question is "how to connect over ssh behind a nat"
Feb 25 11:14:34 <Gamah>	and then that his ISP won't portforwar
Feb 25 11:14:38 <Gamah>	so guessing cgnat...
Feb 25 11:14:54 <Gamah>	so reverse shell
Feb 25 11:15:00 <Sparkles>	I don't think so, or the question is misunderstood.
Feb 25 11:15:11 <Gamah>	genericum: can you elaborate?
Feb 25 11:15:21 <genericum>	Cgnat ...
Feb 25 11:15:25 <Gamah>	:)
Feb 25 11:15:31 <Sparkles>	What CGNat?
Feb 25 11:15:40 <Gamah>	probably the one his ISP is running
Feb 25 11:15:41 <Sparkles>	What does it suppose to change in this case?
Feb 25 11:15:52 <genericum>	I have an ip4 address only
Feb 25 11:16:02 <Gamah>	his WAN IP is not a public IP
Feb 25 11:16:05 <Sparkles>	And why is that a negative trait to that issue?
Feb 25 11:16:08 <Gamah>	because his wan is on CGnat
Feb 25 11:16:25 <Gamah>	it'd be up to his ISP to forward his ssh connection to his gcnat IP
Feb 25 11:16:30 <Sparkles>	There are public IPv4 addresses. They have an IPv4 address.
Feb 25 11:16:39 <Gamah>	i doubt it
Feb 25 11:16:42 <buraq>	genericum: you can fix your issue with tailscale. it creates a private network over the internet. it works in a similar fashion than teamviewer using tailscale's servers
Feb 25 11:16:59 <Gamah>	buraq: but how will he connect to it.. it's the same problem, he's still behind gcnat
Feb 25 11:17:21 <Gamah>	cgnat is why i got off of starlink unfortuantely
Feb 25 11:17:45 <Sparkles>	Tailscale also needs an access to the machine. Do they have an access to the machine? If so, why can't they connect via common SSH to another machine from it?
Feb 25 11:18:02 <Sparkles>	If they cannot connect via SSH, connecting to a VPN server may not work either.
Feb 25 11:18:03 <Gamah>	he can't access the magine from the internet, it does not have a public IP, his WAN ip is on his ISP's nat
Feb 25 11:18:43 <genericum>	Sparkles I was hoping for a TURN solution
Feb 25 11:18:44 <Sparkles>	Do they have an access to the machine?
Feb 25 11:18:49 <Gamah>	genericum: you probably want a reverse shell (the target machine connects out to the internet, then you connect to that machine on the internet to access the nat'd machine in reverse)
Feb 25 11:19:04 <Sparkles>	genericum, do you have an access to the machines?
Feb 25 11:19:18 <Gamah>	if your ISP is small, you might also be able to convince them to port forward for you on a non-standard ssh port
Feb 25 11:19:18 <buraq>	Gamah: because tailscale is magic
Feb 25 11:19:28 <Sparkles>	buraq, tailscale is Wireguard
Feb 25 11:19:43 <Gamah>	buraq: he won't even be able to ping the target machine from the internet, the cgnat is just going to drop it
Feb 25 11:20:00 <buraq>	Gamah: so you know all of what tailscale is able to do?
Feb 25 11:20:02 <genericum>	Gamah no room for discussion there ...
Feb 25 11:20:09 <buraq>	so funny
Feb 25 11:20:33 <genericum>	Buraq vpn could do the trick
Feb 25 11:20:37 <cadmio>	Sparkles: what should I put in $HOME/.xbindkeyrc for my purpose?
Feb 25 11:20:46 <Gamah>	buraq: I mean I see this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb6eVdF-neA
Feb 25 11:20:50 <Sparkles>	genericum, if you have access to both the machines, connecting those to some kind of VPN is an option, or via multiple SSH hops for more generic tunnels.
Feb 25 11:20:53 <Gamah>	but that sounds way more complicated than a reverse shell
Feb 25 11:20:58 <buraq>	Gamah: i see a youtube video url
Feb 25 11:21:12 <Sparkles>	cadmio, I don't know. It's very your environment dependent. There is the docs for it.
Feb 25 11:22:12 <jay>	i install weechat in linux but weechat is not showing in start menu
Feb 25 11:22:21 <Gamah>	genericum: do you have a vps or another machine somewhere that has a public ip?
Feb 25 11:22:28 <Sparkles>	jay, it depends on how and where you install it.
Feb 25 11:22:34 <Sparkles>	How do you install it?
Feb 25 11:22:38 <genericum>	Sparkles I have access to a SSH shell with public ip
Feb 25 11:22:41 <jay>	terminal
Feb 25 11:22:53 <Sparkles>	jay, is the terminal located on Moon?
Feb 25 11:23:15 <genericum>	Gamah ^
Feb 25 11:23:17 <Sparkles>	Please consider be more serious... How could anyone help you with such an answer like "terminal"?
Feb 25 11:23:23 <joshua>	o/
Feb 25 11:23:36 <Gamah>	genericum: so you want to configure the gcnatted machine to reverse shell to tthat machine
Feb 25 11:24:40 <genericum>	That would be the idea
Feb 25 11:25:06 <Gamah>	lots of tutorials out there :)
Feb 25 11:25:48 <genericum>	Gamah well I don't get the listening part ... SSH can do that?
Feb 25 11:26:12 <jay>	which editor should better for beginner ?
Feb 25 11:26:43 <Sparkles>	Editor for what? Beginner in what subjects and for what kind of learning?
Feb 25 11:26:58 <buraq>	genericum: you can test if a port is open for you with: nc -vz host port
Feb 25 11:27:00 <jay>	c and c++ program
Feb 25 11:27:01 <Gamah>	genericum: here's one: https://qbee.io/misc/reverse-ssh-tunneling-the-ultimate-guide/
Feb 25 11:27:33 <Sparkles>	jay, /join #c++-general and #programming then
Feb 25 11:28:03 <jay>	okk
Feb 25 11:28:29 <Sparkles>	I would suggest VSCode and Sublime Text for C++.
Feb 25 11:28:57 <Sparkles>	But, it's very general options. If you need better debugging, you might prefer something more specific.
Feb 25 11:28:58 <joshua>	I would instead suggest something that would be geared towards c++ more, such as CLion or Microsoft Visual Studio
Feb 25 11:29:10 <jay>	thank you sir sparkles
Feb 25 11:29:12 <Sparkles>	It's #linux, joshua
Feb 25 11:29:40 <Sparkles>	Visual Studio is awesome, indeed, but well, not in Linux.
Feb 25 11:29:42 <joshua>	The user never specified his operating system. Many people on this channel are running Windows.
Feb 25 11:29:50 <joshua>	I'm simply covering my bases
Feb 25 11:30:20 <joshua>	iirc you can run vscode in linux
Feb 25 11:30:27 <Gamah>	vscode is a pretty solid editor even on linux
Feb 25 11:30:48 <joshua>	The only downside is that it's built by microsoft
Feb 25 11:30:53 <Sparkles>	VSCode is FOSS, and sure runs on Linux. It's Electron based.
Feb 25 11:31:08 <Sparkles>	The source code Is not built by Microsoft
Feb 25 11:31:17 <spinningCat>	i need some suggestion
Feb 25 11:31:19 <spinningCat>	s
Feb 25 11:31:20 <joshua>	As in its owned and regulated by microsoft
Feb 25 11:31:32 <buraq>	vscode is not made by microsoft?
Feb 25 11:31:43 <spinningCat>	i took video with screenshot feature of system but the file that generates webm and i cannot import that formati in instagram any suggestion took the video of screen?
Feb 25 11:31:44 <buraq>	i don't think you're right
Feb 25 11:31:57 <Sparkles>	Only the official binaries are built by Microsoft and licensed by it. If you build them manually, they are licensed under free GNUv3 only.
Feb 25 11:32:21 <joshua>	I'm referring to the usage rights of the editor itself
Feb 25 11:32:26 <buraq>	Sparkles: but you talked about its source code
Feb 25 11:33:16 <joshua>	spinningCat: could you describe what your problem is with a wider purview of what it is that you're building?
Feb 25 11:33:46 <Sparkles>	joshua, https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60#issuecomment-161792005
Feb 25 11:33:52 <Sparkles>	> When we build Visual Studio Code, we do exactly this. We clone the vscode repository, we lay down a customized product.json that has Microsoft specific functionality (telemetry, gallery, logo, etc.), and then produce a build that we release under our license.
Feb 25 11:33:56 <Gamah>	microsoft still owns that repo... technically
Feb 25 11:33:56 <spinningCat>	i push printscreen and a screenshow program open
Feb 25 11:33:57 <Sparkles>	> When you clone and build from the vscode repo, none of these endpoints are configured in the default product.json. Therefore, you generate a "clean" build, without the Microsoft customizations, which is by default licensed under the MIT license (note, i made this commit to help make this more clear).
Feb 25 11:34:09 <spinningCat>	i took video with that utility but that produce video webm
Feb 25 11:34:20 <spinningCat>	and instagram does not accept webm
Feb 25 11:34:23 <joshua>	Sparkles: ok, thanks for clarification
Feb 25 11:34:29 <Sparkles>	Gamah, you clone the repo, and it's in your local pen drive.
Feb 25 11:34:33 <joshua>	spinningCat:  So convert it into a different file format
Feb 25 11:34:41 <Gamah>	Sparkles: right but microsoft still owns it...
Feb 25 11:34:48 <Sparkles>	...
Feb 25 11:34:52 <Gamah>	you can't relicense it
Feb 25 11:34:53 <fb`>	Microsoft loves that telemetry
Feb 25 11:34:55 <Gamah>	it isn't "your" code lol
Feb 25 11:35:08 <Gamah>	it's free and open source but microsoft is the copyright holder
Feb 25 11:35:11 <Sparkles>	Why should it be my code?
Feb 25 11:35:14 <Sparkles>	I did not write it.
Feb 25 11:35:27 <Sparkles>	I had not inevst my effort in it so much to even dare to call it my code.
Feb 25 11:35:44 <buraq>	i lost the plot
Feb 25 11:36:08 <Sparkles>	Of course they are a copyright owner like everyone responsible in this world. This is how licenses work. I don't understand what you mean.

Feb 28 00:31:40 <ski>	levitating : it doesn't keep state for the fibonacci sequence around, in the coroutine
Feb 28 00:32:05 <levitating>	no it does not
Feb 28 00:32:52 <levitating>	well it does in a way, by keeping state of its next instruction in the function
Feb 28 00:33:32 <ski>	yes, but not the last two numbers in the sequence
Feb 28 00:34:39 <ski>	(if you wanted to generate more than ten numbers in the sequence, you'd have to change `fibonacci', and not just `main')

Feb 28 00:48:28 <Sparkles>	OSX is not a distro.
Feb 28 00:48:55 <ssm_>	also *BSD is the better comparison for macos since they have a common ancestor

You should consider using a pastebin to list out commands in series with comments as you go.  Putting everything into a gigantic paragraph that takes up two lines in IRC is incomprehensible.

Feb 28 02:12:41 <mdogg>	I'm not asking you to put 2-5 words per line.  That's even worse.  I'm asking you to present your question with various scenarios in a way that makes it easy for the reader to follow.  Right now it presents as a gigantic run-on sentence.
Feb 28 02:12:53 <fb`>	phogg that kinda works, still have to hit 'n' a few times to find it
Feb 28 02:13:02 <Sparkles>	phogg, I even sent a full blown Docker test case to omit "works on my machine".
Feb 28 02:13:12 <rbox>	versus half blown?
Feb 28 02:13:14 <Pikk3wyn>	Sparkles: using ` instead of $(, unclear context due to lack of formatting, inconsistent use of `` later,
Feb 28 02:13:28 <Sparkles>	What the heck?
Feb 28 02:13:30 <mdogg>	Maybe someone will understand it.  I'm only trying to help.
Feb 28 02:13:38 <kurahaupo>	Sparkles: On Linux /dev/stdout is usually a symlink to /proc/self/fd/1, and that in turn is a "magic" symlink to /dev/tty or wherever output is redirected; chmod will effectively follow that symlink and change the permissions on the target file
Feb 28 02:13:38 <phogg>	Sparkles: the full blwon test case is adding confusion not reducing it. Are you asking about pty allocation? Interaction between sudo and the invoked bash process? Some docker corner case?
Feb 28 02:13:48 <Sparkles>	Pikk3wyn, the surrounding `` are the ones added for the chat.
Feb 28 02:13:57 <Sparkles>	phogg, nonsese.
Feb 28 02:14:01 <Anjor>	Sparkles: I'm not joking - Ask ChatGPT.  Listerally paste your question from here into chatGPT.  It should guide you just as good as the current help here.
Feb 28 02:14:19 <Sparkles>	kurahaupo, this is what I meant by setting it 777.
Feb 28 02:14:24 <Pikk3wyn>	ah, rather don't use shell metacharacters for that
Feb 28 02:15:00 <Sparkles>	Yet, I thought it's a security hole since it's owned by root and I hence asked if it possible to create new fd for the sake of su without its own -P option.
Feb 28 02:15:02 <JakLareo>	Sparkles: if you have a Docker-specific question, there is the #docker channel. However, when you ask there, I would suggest by starting with the use case you are trying to solve for, first, to provide some context for what you're asking
Feb 28 02:15:12 <kurahaupo>	Sparkles: why do you want to turn on exec permission
Feb 28 02:15:14 <Sparkles>	This is not a Docker specific question.
Feb 28 02:15:17 <Pikk3wyn>	Sparkles: setting it what in what context
Feb 28 02:15:26 <Sparkles>	Pikk3wyn, in your contenxt.
Feb 28 02:15:27 <rascul>	Sparkles why use su with sudo?
Feb 28 02:15:36 <phogg>	why redirect to /dev/stdout at all?
Feb 28 02:15:47 <Pikk3wyn>	my context includes a full shell output w/ errors
Feb 28 02:15:54 <Sparkles>	kurahaupo, thank you at least for the sanity in your responses...
Feb 28 02:16:04 <Pikk3wyn>	and alsol, what you are trying to accomplish
Feb 28 02:16:07 <rascul>	oh i just noticed redirect to stdout
Feb 28 02:16:14 <Sparkles>	Pikk3wyn, I wrote it above.
Feb 28 02:16:22 <rascul>	and the redirect is outside of the context of root
Feb 28 02:16:24 <Pikk3wyn>	changing the perms on /dev/stdout is the wrong way to do it
Feb 28 02:16:32 <Sparkles>	...
Feb 28 02:16:36 <Sparkles>	Forget it.
Feb 28 02:16:46 *	Anjor forgets.
Feb 28 02:16:47 <Sparkles>	Thank you very much, dear kurahaupo. I'll just ask somewhere else.
Feb 28 02:16:54 <Pikk3wyn>	idk what you are trying to do but you should change it explicitly
Feb 28 02:16:55 <phogg>	also unnecessary since output from within your bash -c script will hit your stdout anyway
Feb 28 02:17:06 *	llanhmock thinks kurahaupo should take the lead on this since they speak Sparkles 
Feb 28 02:17:06 <Pikk3wyn>	a process can change it's own permissions on the FDs
Feb 28 02:17:18 <rascul>	must understand or fix this weirdness to proceed
Feb 28 02:18:07 <llanhmock>	but honestly, if one doesn't understand it would just best serve to say nothing.
Feb 28 02:18:15 <Pikk3wyn>	Sparkles: you aren't listening
Feb 28 02:18:22 <Sparkles>	Pikk3wyn, you yoo.
Feb 28 02:18:23 <Pikk3wyn>	of course /dev/stdin etc is owned by root
Feb 28 02:18:23 <Sparkles>	too*
Feb 28 02:18:31 <rascul>	'sudo su - -s /bin/bash -c "echo 1 > /dev/stdout;"' can be replaced with 'sudo -i echo 1'
Feb 28 02:18:33 <Pikk3wyn>	that's why you don't try change that
Feb 28 02:18:39 <rascul>	for the same functionality without the weirdness
Feb 28 02:18:46 <Sparkles>	Change what?
Feb 28 02:18:57 <phogg>	rascul: which inspires the question: why is this being done in such a convoluted way?
Feb 28 02:19:05 <Pikk3wyn>	you said you wanted to change perm on it
Feb 28 02:19:08 <Pikk3wyn>	you already own it
Feb 28 02:19:10 <rbox>	rascul: you're full of wierdness
Feb 28 02:19:15 <rascul>	i wonder if what was shared isn't what is actually run
Feb 28 02:19:17 <Sparkles>	Pikk3wyn, the task is to redirect output to a file, and the default is /dev/stdout.
Feb 28 02:19:24 <phogg>	*I* presume there must be some subtle interaction that is being asked about, but that was not made clear... and Sparkles won't explain since he seems to think it should be obvious.
Feb 28 02:19:24 <Pikk3wyn>	ok
Feb 28 02:19:25 <Sparkles>	Pikk3wyn, who said it?
Feb 28 02:19:30 <kurahaupo>	Sparkles: chances are you can simply remove ">/dev/stdout" after "echo"
Feb 28 02:19:39 <Sparkles>	I said the Docker command for the crystal clear test case.
Feb 28 02:19:46 <mdogg>	kurahaupo: You either have the patience of a saint or the perception of Carnac the Magnificent.
Feb 28 02:19:50 <llanhmock>	phogg: either way, the help is free and voluntary.
Feb 28 02:20:05 <rascul>	we can get into how to do the redirection inside the context of the root shell instead of outside but i really need to understand the weirdness first
Feb 28 02:20:13 <phogg>	Sparkles: but I can't run your docker command, so I have to wonder which parts to remove in order to find the part you are actually trying to test
Feb 28 02:20:17 <Sparkles>	kurahaupo, this redirection is written as > "${filepath:-/dev/stdout}" and hence the issue.
Feb 28 02:20:44 <kurahaupo>	Ok. Can you edit that line?
Feb 28 02:20:48 <Pikk3wyn>	Sparkles: redirect output to a file?
Feb 28 02:21:05 <Sparkles>	kurahaupo, why should I? The output must be either to the screen or file.
Feb 28 02:21:12 <Pikk3wyn>	that's what you need to do, 100% in whole?
Feb 28 02:21:27 <Sparkles>	More to that, there's one for stderr and another for stdout by default.
Feb 28 02:21:57 <kurahaupo>	Sparkles: consider instead [[ -n $filepath ]] && exec >"$filepath" ; echo …
Feb 28 02:22:08 <Sparkles>	This script has at least 28 places where this logic exists.
Feb 28 02:22:17 <phogg>	Sparkles: can you modify the script?
Feb 28 02:22:27 <rascul>	hit whoever wrote it on the head a few times
Feb 28 02:22:33 <rascul>	softly though
Feb 28 02:22:45 <phogg>	Sparkles: you can use exec to conditionally point stdout or stderr to a file, then omit the literal redirect on the commands
Feb 28 02:22:46 <Pikk3wyn>	Sparkles: the 'screen' is still a file, it's outputting the stream to it's file descriptor by the i/o streams
Feb 28 02:22:48 <Pikk3wyn>	by default
Feb 28 02:22:55 <Sparkles>	And there are a lot of groups like: { c1; c2; c3; c4; } > "${stdoutFilepath:-/dev/stdout}" 2> "${stderrFilepath:-/dev/stderr}"
Feb 28 02:23:06 <Sparkles>	At least 20 of such groups.
Feb 28 02:23:16 <Pikk3wyn>	if you want to output to terminal or a file, just give option for a file
Feb 28 02:23:28 <kurahaupo>	Sparkles: Linux's /dev/stdout is different from most other Unix, where it's a funny way to do dup()
Feb 28 02:23:35 <Sparkles>	Pikk3wyn, I am sorry... but do you read?
Feb 28 02:23:36 <Pikk3wyn>	the default is to use stdout stderr streams, you don't need to do anything special for that
Feb 28 02:23:39 <Sparkles>	Why do you write without reading?
Feb 28 02:23:53 <phogg>	Sparkles: again, can you alter the script?
Feb 28 02:23:53 <Anjor>	Rude.
Feb 28 02:23:55 <Sparkles>	Pikk3wyn, and how would you change that conditionally then?
Feb 28 02:24:04 <Sparkles>	phogg, sure I can. Why would I/
Feb 28 02:24:16 <kurahaupo>	Sparkles: is it the same path each time? If so, open it once, at the top
Feb 28 02:24:22 <phogg>	Sparkles: [[ -n $stdoutFilePath ]] && exec 1>"$stdoutFilePath" # unless kurahaupo wants to correct me here
Feb 28 02:24:41 <phogg>	Sparkles: then remove the literal redirects
Feb 28 02:25:05 <Pikk3wyn>	Sparkles: either you redirect streams, or you don't
Feb 28 02:25:08 <rascul>	get rid of the useless su also
Feb 28 02:25:11 <phogg>	Sparkles: if the condition was true anything that *would have* been written to stdout is instead written to the file, if it was false it emerges on stdout as normal
Feb 28 02:25:20 <Pikk3wyn>	whether that's based on a flag, or whatever doesn't matter
Feb 28 02:25:22 <Sparkles>	Is it possible to recreate what -P of su does without using this option?
Feb 28 02:25:34 <phogg>	Sparkles: and what rascul said, sudo su redundant
Feb 28 02:25:36 <kurahaupo>	if [[ $file]] ; then exec 4>$file ; else exec 4>&1 ; fi … then replace every other >${file:-/dev/stdout} with >&4
Feb 28 02:25:42 <rbox>	rascul: atleast it's not a useless cat
Feb 28 02:25:50 <Sparkles>	phogg, you don't know what script does. It's not redundant.
Feb 28 02:25:55 <phogg>	Sparkles: see kurahaupo above who has a somewhat more complete example
Feb 28 02:26:07 <rascul>	the usage of sudo su that you shared is redundant
Feb 28 02:26:14 <phogg>	Sparkles: I assure you that it cannot matter if it is in the script as it was in your example.
Feb 28 02:26:18 <Sparkles>	kurahaupo, I said, it's 20 groups. The script will become more than 20 in size.
Feb 28 02:26:26 <kurahaupo>	Dang it [[ $file ]] # needs a space
Feb 28 02:26:30 <Sparkles>	I would need to copy paste the same exact group woth different redirections.
Feb 28 02:26:35 <Sparkles>	with*
Feb 28 02:26:35 <phogg>	Sparkles: you only set up the redirects *once*, at the start
Feb 28 02:26:48 <Sparkles>	phogg, no. It may change during the scrit.
Feb 28 02:27:03 <phogg>	Sparkles: what may? The variable? If so you then re-exec to the new file
Feb 28 02:27:09 <Sparkles>	Re: 3x: Is it possible to recreate what -P of su does without using this option?
Feb 28 02:27:16 <phogg>	or rather, you do so instead of changing the variable
Feb 28 02:27:19 <mdogg>	I think we should just let kurahaupo work with him.  He seems to be making progress.
Feb 28 02:27:28 <rascul>	you shouldn't be needing -P
Feb 28 02:27:54 <kurahaupo>	Sparkles: is it always the same variable name? (if so I have another solution)
Feb 28 02:27:54 <a51>	I have export EDITOR=vim but visudo is launched in nano
Feb 28 02:28:05 <rbox>	a51: what do you mean you "have" that
Feb 28 02:28:15 <a51>	I have in .zshrc
Feb 28 02:28:19 <rbox>	try setting VISUAL
Feb 28 02:28:21 <rbox>	instead of EDITOR
Feb 28 02:28:25 <kurahaupo>	a51: do you have $VISUAL ?
Feb 28 02:28:30 <a51>	no
Feb 28 02:28:30 <rascul>	a51 is SUDO_EDITOR or VISUAL set?
Feb 28 02:28:41 <phogg>	a51: if VISUAL is set it is used in preference to EDITOR
Feb 28 02:28:42 <Sparkles>	kurahaupo, the redirection to 4 is a marvelous idea actually.
Feb 28 02:28:51 <Pikk3wyn>	set VISUAL and EDITOR
Feb 28 02:28:54 <rascul>	SUDO_EDITOR is preferred over VISUAL or EDITOR
Feb 28 02:29:24 <Sparkles>	kurahaupo, what would be another solution, if I may ask?
Feb 28 02:29:36 <kurahaupo>	Sparkles: some care is needed to control when the target file is truncated
Feb 28 02:30:10 <Sparkles>	I am sorry, target file?
Feb 28 02:30:19 <kurahaupo>	Sparkles: write a function that redirects and then runs its args
Feb 28 02:30:57 <Sparkles>	I see. So create a center of executing commands.
Feb 28 02:31:17 <kurahaupo>	with_redir() { if [[ -n $file ]] ; then "$@" >$file ; else "$@"; fi }
Feb 28 02:31:25 <Sparkles>	This makes absolute sense for two options, indeed.
Feb 28 02:31:34 <kurahaupo>	with_redir echo 1
Feb 28 02:31:34 <Sparkles>	You are genius, kurahaupo! Thank you very very much!!!
Feb 28 02:32:37 <Sparkles>	The last one, just in sake of curiousity, regading -P of su. Is it possible to recreate its logic anyhow without changing permissions of fd but creating new custom PTY?
Feb 28 02:32:40 <kurahaupo>	Sparkles: if you need a different variable each time that's also possible, just pass it as the first arg

Feb 29 01:16:34 <r-zan>	Hello hello
Feb 29 01:16:46 <luna_>	hi
Feb 29 01:16:54 <r-zan>	testing out pidgin compared to hexchat
Feb 29 01:18:49 <alguien>	r-zan, hello, time traveler
Feb 29 01:19:06 <alguien>	but seriously, let me know how it goes
Feb 29 01:19:17 *	alguien remembers the du-dung sound
Feb 29 01:19:21 <r-zan>	Pidgin? Well I mean, it's not like IRC is all that complex to run :P
Feb 29 01:19:28 <r-zan>	It feels a bit...2008 though
Feb 29 01:21:42 <n4dir>	what was 2008?
Feb 29 01:22:03 <r-zan>	Oh, the pidgin client
Feb 29 01:22:40 <Patrick_>	pidgin for IRC?
Feb 29 01:23:10 <n4dir>	yeah, real nerds would use a web-browser
Feb 29 01:23:20 <r-zan>	Yeah, I kinda wanna see if it's a good client to replace juggling other chats
Feb 29 01:23:27 <alguien>	n4dir, huh?
Feb 29 01:23:29 <luna_>	then i am not a real nerd
Feb 29 01:23:32 <r-zan>	So, seeing if I can consolidate or not
Feb 29 01:23:49 <Patrick_>	yeah, being diversified over protocols is a pain
Feb 29 01:24:04 <r-zan>	All because I don't wanna use discord.... =_=
Feb 29 01:24:15 <r-zan>	The path of suffering better be worth it
Feb 29 01:24:17 <Patrick_>	what do you mean? just don't.
Feb 29 01:24:37 <Patrick_>	how does pidgin get you out of that?
Feb 29 01:24:46 <n4dir>	voodoo
Feb 29 01:24:52 <r-zan>	Oh, because there's plugins for other protocols
Feb 29 01:25:01 <r-zan>	So instead of living in a world of alt-tab
Feb 29 01:25:02 <alguien>	whoa https://github.com/EionRobb/purple-discord/#readme
Feb 29 01:25:09 <alguien>	maybe pidgin is worth checking out again
Feb 29 01:25:16 <r-zan>	I was wondering if I could push it all onto the purple bird
Feb 29 01:25:30 <n4dir>	depends what "all" is
Feb 29 01:28:59 <r-zan>	Well, matrix and telegram for one. Maybe discord if I ever decide to use it again
Feb 29 01:29:07 <r-zan>	Though I do know that discord does NOT like third party clients
Feb 29 01:29:20 <NeXeN>	but discord does support bots
Feb 29 01:29:46 <r-zan>	True, but I'm not exactly looking to race back to that.
Feb 29 01:29:58 <r-zan>	I said I was gonna avoid that platform as long as I could. Dammit I'm gonna
Feb 29 01:30:09 <n4dir>	who forces you to use it?
Feb 29 01:31:18 <r-zan>	I wouldn't say forced, but if I want to download a mod for a game "Download in the discord". Support for a program? "Join the discord". Talk to someone on a game? "What do you mean you dont use discord?"
Feb 29 01:31:32 <n4dir>	i see.
Feb 29 01:32:06 <n4dir>	r-zan: and pidgin could run matrix and/or telegram?
Feb 29 01:32:29 <r-zan>	That's what I'm looking into
Feb 29 01:32:39 <luna_>	r-zan: neihter does Telegram
Feb 29 01:32:39 <n4dir>	ah, you try to figure it out. Got you now. Nice.
Feb 29 01:33:50 <n4dir>	i sure liked pidgin as irc client, but i also forgot what other things i used it for.
Feb 29 01:34:09 <r-zan>	Hmm... matrix plugin last update was a year ago. Latest release was  2021
Feb 29 01:34:28 <r-zan>	last update on the telegram github was 3 years ago :(
Feb 29 01:35:38 <r-zan>	Oh well, maybe not then
Feb 29 01:37:44 <Patrick_>	yeah, I don't think it's well maintained at all
Feb 29 01:38:16 <n4dir>	would there be another solution?
Feb 29 01:38:19 <Patrick_>	it's a nice idea but covering multiple protocols seems like a lot of work
Feb 29 01:40:14 <Random6>	Hello Linuxites
Feb 29 01:40:37 <r-zan>	Hello random
Feb 29 01:40:41 <r-zan>	Also, no clue
Feb 29 01:40:54 <r-zan>	Other than just telling friends "Meet me on this or goodbye" lol
Feb 29 01:42:58 <Random6>	My intel Iris XE runs fallout 4 at 30 - 60 fps on 1080p and lowest settings. Very impressive for integrated intel
Feb 29 01:42:59 <alguien>	meanwhile I'm on discord via pidgin
Feb 29 01:43:09 <r-zan>	And back
Feb 29 01:43:12 <Random6>	^ how do you that?
Feb 29 01:43:13 <r-zan>	How well does it work?
Feb 29 01:43:36 <alguien>	bearable?
Feb 29 01:43:44 <Random6>	Isn't that a bouncer?
Feb 29 01:44:59 <alguien>	Can't view discord stickers
Feb 29 01:49:43 <alguien>	it's a bit of a mess, tbh
Feb 29 01:49:44 <Sparkles>	Random6, https://github.com/EionRobb/purple-discord/?tab=readme-ov-file#slash-commands
Feb 29 01:49:59 <Sparkles>	Listed here: https://www.pidgin.im/plugins/?publisher=all&query=discord&type=
Feb 29 01:50:13 <Sparkles>	Please be aware that it breaks Discord ToS.
Feb 29 01:50:31 <Sparkles>	And thus may result in your account banned.
Feb 29 01:50:42 <Random6>	Thanks Sparkles
Feb 29 01:50:56 <Random6>	Can I make weechat or irssi do that?
Feb 29 01:51:07 <Sparkles>	Sure thing. It would break the ToS the same way.
Feb 29 01:51:34 <Random6>	Can you pleaze remind me what ToS means?
Feb 29 01:51:40 <r-zan_>	Terms of Service
Feb 29 01:51:48 <r-zan_>	Discord does NOT like third party applications
Feb 29 01:52:33 <Sparkles>	It likes them. It has at least 3 different ways to work with third parties, including API, bots, webhooks.
Feb 29 01:53:22 <Sparkles>	I don't see it an issue though but an accountable way to also not get to the same road as Reddit did resulting in lack of resources to handle all of it.
Feb 29 01:53:58 <luna_>	Reddits users did not really like the IPO or they will generate AI content for Google
Feb 29 01:54:21 <Sparkles>	I see it an accountable attitude towards business they are responsible for to provide for the users and communities.
Feb 29 01:54:44 <Sparkles>	Random6, just in case, an example: https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless#i-am-closing-down-the-cordless-project
Feb 29 01:54:48 <luna_>	i only use Reddit to talk to one person but in worse case i can send postcards or knock on their door :p

Feb 29 02:01:21 <Sparkles>	LinuxNoob, when does it happen?
Feb 29 02:01:33 <Sparkles>	What have you tried to solve it?
Feb 29 02:02:20 <espresso>	or perhaps pulseaudio-bluetooth not installed? https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=270465
Feb 29 02:02:50 <LinuxNoob>	Sparkles: I have tried reinstalling Pulseaudio and Bluez, changed couple of confg files but still nothing
Feb 29 02:03:07 <LinuxNoob>	I am trying to connect my BT headset
Feb 29 02:03:40 <Sparkles>	LinuxNoob, does it happen when you: `bluetoothctl`, and then `connect {mac}` inside the REPL?

Feb 29 02:04:42 <mdogg>	Those of you who use Signal  --  The Signal Desktop application is starting to come available for more and more GNU/Linux distributions.  A lot of the installation packages are still only available from community repositories so you probably won't find it in your system repositories unless you're running what they refer to as a 'Debian Based' distro.

Feb 29 02:07:10 <SponiX>	luna_: why not both?
Feb 29 02:07:14 <LinuxNoob>	Sparkles: that's correct
Feb 29 02:07:22 <luna_>	SponiX: also an option
Feb 29 02:07:27 <mdogg>	Must be a small cat if it can only type one character at a time.

Feb 29 02:09:14 <espresso>	NeXeN: the solution was mainly just generating the CA + certs correctly
Feb 29 02:10:41 <Disconsented>	Im surprised that sigyn didn't smack them first
Feb 29 02:10:57 <Sparkles>	espresso, that's awesome to know! May I ask what was the case and solution?
Feb 29 02:14:33 <espresso>	Sparkles, NeXeN: Things worked when I had read the docs enough to see what was relevant, and worked out how to generate the CA+certs correctly.
Feb 29 02:15:23 <LinuxNoob>	@Sparkles  thank you
Feb 29 02:15:33 <LinuxNoob>	:) I am back up and running
Feb 29 02:15:40 <Sparkles>	espresso, rother that. Well, sometimes it just needs some more time indeed.
Feb 29 02:16:05 <Sparkles>	LinuxNoob, what was it if I may ask? That link with 'libspa'?
Feb 29 02:17:23 <LinuxNoob>	Sparkles: installing this  libspa-0.2-bluetooth has resolved it

Feb 29 02:19:09 <Sparkles>	LinuxNoob, marvelous! Please consider leaving a comment there if you want!
Feb 29 02:21:34 <gry>	LinuxNoob, new linux install on this machine? :)
Feb 29 02:21:35 <espresso>	after a permissions slip-up on $HOME I spent a couple hours restoring them from backup, with getfacl/setfacl by far the safest and easiest method. And took the opportunity to change /etc/pam.d/system-login umask=027 (so far, so good)
Feb 29 02:24:04 <ayecee>	that'll keep those other users from writing to your files
Feb 29 02:28:33 <jamiahx2>	what UUID do I put in my `/etc/crypttab`? https://pastebin.com/JM5wd4jj
Feb 29 02:28:40 <jamiahx2>	7a19... or 9a1f...?
Feb 29 02:28:55 <jamiahx2>	I am following https://askubuntu.com/questions/1335006/what-is-the-recommended-method-to-encrypt-the-home-directory-in-ubuntu-21-04
Feb 29 02:29:18 <ayecee>	which one do they use
Feb 29 02:30:32 <ayecee>	think through this. should you be able to see the filesystem before the container is unlocked?
Feb 29 02:31:13 <jamiahx2>	ah, so crypttab is what is mounting the encrypted partition, then fstab reads the mapped unencrypted
Feb 29 02:31:26 <ayecee>	unlocking the encrypted partition
Feb 29 02:31:31 <ayecee>	not mounting
Feb 29 02:31:44 <jamiahx2>	okay
Feb 29 02:31:47 <espresso>	ayecee: 027 would keep just *any* user being able to read others' files, which seems a good idea..
Feb 29 02:32:37 <ayecee>	espresso: it was 022 previously?
Feb 29 02:32:43 <espresso>	yes, arch default
Feb 29 02:32:47 <ayecee>	i see
Feb 29 02:32:49 <LtL>	 c
Feb 29 02:47:19 <jamiahx2>	do I need to set up a subvolume for my /home? is it just a directory called `@home`?
Feb 29 02:48:01 <gry>	Why @home ?
Feb 29 02:48:11 <gry>	It is in $HOME, or /home/usernamehere/
Feb 29 02:48:12 <alguien>	jamiahx2, can be either
Feb 29 02:48:13 <mdogg>	It depends on how you'd like it to be setup.  Some people like creating a subvolume for @/home under their root directory because it makes it easier to resize in case they need to move space around.
Feb 29 02:48:23 <buraq>	ubuntu uses @home
Feb 29 02:48:46 <alguien>	ok, what's with the @ symbols?
Feb 29 02:48:59 <jamiahx2>	my goal is to recreate my original setup, which apparently had an @home subvolume
Feb 29 02:49:01 <buraq>	the btrfs subvolume name
Feb 29 02:49:32 <alguien>	thx, seems idk what i'm talking about
Feb 29 02:49:35 <mdogg>	I don't like putting /home under the root partition (subvolume or not) because it's nice to keep your data completely separate from root just in case something happens to the OS, or in case you just feel like wiping the entire thing.  \
Feb 29 02:49:47 <jamiahx2>	and yes, the home partition did have `/mount/homepartition/@home/users`
Feb 29 02:50:09 <alguien>	mdogg, have you ever resized your partitions?
Feb 29 02:50:23 <mdogg>	gry: When /home is a logical volume it presents as '@/home' most of the time.
Feb 29 02:50:37 <mdogg>	alguien: Yep.
Feb 29 02:50:43 <jamiahx2>	is a separate partition a subvolume?
Feb 29 02:50:43 *	alguien smiles
Feb 29 02:51:31 <buraq>	jamiahx2: a partition -> btrfs filesystem -> btrfs subvolumes
Feb 29 02:52:00 <jamiahx2>	so they're just fancy directories treated as quasipartitions?
Feb 29 02:52:23 <mdogg>	No, a separate partition is generally referred to as a 'primary' partition.
Feb 29 02:52:59 <jamiahx2>	er, are *subvolumes just fancy directories treated as quasipartitions?
Feb 29 02:53:11 <rbox>	mdogg: you're primary
Feb 29 02:53:36 <mdogg>	I guess you could think of them like that.  They are partitions which are managed by the filesystem.
Feb 29 02:54:43 <Sparkles>	kurahaupo, just in case, both 'php://stdout' and 'php://output' returned no error, so it must be something different: t="$( mktemp; )"; cat <<< '<?php $fp = fopen("php://stdout", "w"); fputs($fp, "Test\n"); fclose($fp);' > "$t"; docker run -it -v "${t}:/opt/t.php" --rm -- php:8.3-bookworm bash -c $'apt update; apt install -y sudo; useradd -r t; chmod 755 -- /opt/t.php; sudo su - -c \'id; php
Feb 29 02:54:45 <Sparkles>	/opt/t.php;\' t'; rm -v -- "$t";
Feb 29 02:55:46 <mdogg>	For instance, say you have a 100GB disk and allow btrfs to please @/home as a subvolume under root and root is 60GB and @/home is 40GB.  If you need more space in @/home at some point, it's easy to have btrfs reallocate 20GB to @/home and reduce root to 40GB.
Feb 29 02:57:12 <mdogg>	If you use ext4 or xfs or some other filesystem, resizing partitions isn't so easy - particularly when there are other mount points in between.
Feb 29 02:58:33 <mdogg>	jamiahx2: In case you're interested, this is how I like setting up Linux boxes with two block devices (disk drives) --> https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/c0de41261581
Feb 29 02:59:48 <jamiahx2>	wow, that is so much nicer than pastebin
Feb 29 03:00:47 <mdogg>	Actually, there's an even better one that will let you paste a short RAW URL --> https://paste.disconsented.com/
Feb 29 03:00:50 <buraq>	jamiahx2: pastebin has the raw link for nice pastes
Feb 29 03:00:56 <Disconsented>	:eyes:
Feb 29 03:01:10 <jamiahx2>	oh neat
Feb 29 03:01:25 <Disconsented>	Yeah uh I make no guarantees for my pastebin but microbin is really neat
Feb 29 03:01:35 <buraq>	hehe discopaste lol
Feb 29 03:01:55 <mdogg>	buraq: I love being able to paste RAW data, too.  You can do that with openSUSE's pastebin but when they changed the interface the RAW URL is a mile long, so it's not pretty to paste.
Feb 29 03:02:22 <buraq>	mdogg: i meant the output when it's loaded
Feb 29 03:06:52 <mdogg>	DiscoPaste guarantees a 99.99999999% service up-time and that your paste will be available when you need it, or they will give you twice your money back.

Feb 29 03:27:10 <rbox>	like when
Feb 29 03:27:24 <jamiahx2>	like when starting up the system or trying to log in?
Feb 29 03:27:34 <rbox>	that depends on if your dist has a script set up to do that
Feb 29 03:27:41 <jamiahx2>	it's ubuntu
Feb 29 03:27:48 <rbox>	okay... the answer is still the same
Feb 29 03:29:31 <ZLima12>	jamiah2, if you want help specific to Ubuntu, you might have better luck in #ubuntu
Feb 29 03:30:01 <ZLima12>	jamiahx2, sorry for the typo

Feb 29 04:21:11 <stuv>	i'm not able to find whre linux mounted my android device
Feb 29 04:21:39 <ayecee>	maybe it's not mounted
Feb 29 04:21:40 <stuv>	i seached my hole HD and he was not able to find the DCIM folder which is in the main path of my android device
Feb 29 04:21:54 <stuv>	i can see my file with android-file-transfer
Feb 29 04:22:10 <ayecee>	maybe android-file-transfer doesn't mount
Feb 29 04:22:19 <ayecee>	more like an ftp thing
Feb 29 04:22:38 <stuv>	how to find the ftp connection then ?
Feb 29 04:23:00 <ayecee>	it's not an ftp connection.
Feb 29 04:24:07 <lockywolf>	stuv: you probably need the command called "adb"
Feb 29 04:24:16 <ayecee>	need it for what
Feb 29 04:24:29 <lockywolf>	for learning how to work with Android
Feb 29 04:24:45 <ayecee>	i don't think that's the goal here.
Feb 29 04:25:13 <lockywolf>	🤷
Feb 29 04:25:53 <dragonmaster>	stuv: I recommend you put the phone in USB mass storage mode (I'm assuming you're using a USB cable)
Feb 29 04:26:18 <lockywolf>	dragonmaster: most phones nowadays cannot do that
Feb 29 04:26:18 <ayecee>	android phones don't support that.
Feb 29 04:26:30 <lockywolf>	ayecee: "most android phones"
Feb 29 04:26:36 <ayecee>	fine.
Feb 29 04:26:37 <dragonmaster>	That's funny.  My pixel 6a does
Feb 29 04:26:54 <dragonmaster>	I know that's a little older, but...
Feb 29 04:27:08 <ayecee>	is that still running kitkat
Feb 29 04:27:26 <dragonmaster>	it's android 14
Feb 29 04:27:37 <ayecee>	my bad
Feb 29 04:29:55 <ayecee>	most would use mtp, media transfer protocol, very often using libmtp.
Feb 29 04:29:56 <espresso>	mine is used in MTP [shudder..what a simply horrible] mode and mounts at /run/user/1000
Feb 29 04:30:31 <espresso>	*mounts under
Feb 29 04:30:43 <dragonmaster>	Hmmm.   I might be a lying liar
Feb 29 04:31:04 <ayecee>	it's only lying if you know it's not true
Feb 29 04:31:06 <espresso>	(I do realize MTP is horrible in part to prevent broken files)
Feb 29 04:31:10 <dragonmaster>	ayecee: I apologize
Feb 29 04:31:18 <dviola>	I had every sata ssd and hdd fail on this machine except a nvme drive (it has yet to fail), what are the chances my sata controller is the culprit? this is the smartctl for my hdd: http://0x0.st/HRWd.txt
Feb 29 04:31:51 <ayecee>	about 2%
Feb 29 04:32:08 <dragonmaster>	Nah, I didn't know, I was just assuming.   The fact that I said so in public without checking should have been a clue that I was being an idiot
Feb 29 04:32:28 <ayecee>	don't be so hard on yourself. let us do that.
Feb 29 04:32:36 <dragonmaster>	you had me at the start
Feb 29 04:33:12 <ayecee>	dviola: fails in what way
Feb 29 04:34:08 <lockywolf>	ha, I have seemingly just repaired ipv6 for Hacker News
Feb 29 04:34:37 <dviola>	ayecee: read errors on dmesg, etc: http://0x0.st/HRVT.txt
Feb 29 04:34:50 <lockywolf>	Two tier 1 networks were not talking IPv6 to each other and were using one of them as default route for IPv6. We have added more specific routes to the destination network and their customers to go out another of our providers.  When these peering fights happen, it breaks things for a lot of people.
Feb 29 04:34:54 <lockywolf>	(c)
Feb 29 04:35:10 <dviola>	ayecee: sometimes performance degradation after getting similar errors, etc
Feb 29 04:35:18 <espresso>	dviola: that log looks fine to me, and I assume you did not use SATA power cables from a different PSU..
Feb 29 04:35:29 <dviola>	ayecee: I already replaced cables, PSUs, etc
Feb 29 04:35:49 <ayecee>	before or after the failures
Feb 29 04:36:38 <espresso>	I never once read anywhere not to use power cables from a different PSU pinout even though manufacturers make them 'fit' perfectly, yet fried two drives that way
Feb 29 04:37:00 <ayecee>	dviola: is this smartctl output from the same drive in the dmesg output?
Feb 29 04:37:17 <dviola>	ayecee: yes
Feb 29 04:37:43 <ayecee>	dviola: is the smartctl output from before or after the read error?
Feb 29 04:38:01 <dviola>	ayecee: after
Feb 29 04:38:31 <ayecee>	ah. reallocated sector ct is non-zero. probably just the drive then.
Feb 29 04:39:09 <ayecee>	at 12000 hours, it's had a good life.
Feb 29 04:39:56 <ananke>	that's rather low. either way, it's toast
Feb 29 04:40:20 <ayecee>	seems like the drive is running kinda hot too
Feb 29 04:40:46 <dviola>	the weather was really hot today
Feb 29 04:41:01 <rbox>	ananke: whole wheat or white?
Feb 29 04:41:01 <ayecee>	using it outdoors then?
Feb 29 04:41:11 <espresso>	yeah, they usually seem to last well over a decade. but I suppose mechanical failures can cut that drastically short.
Feb 29 04:41:27 <ananke>	rbox: more like pumpernickel color
Feb 29 04:41:27 <ayecee>	also frequent start/stops.
Feb 29 04:41:43 <ananke>	bathtub curve.
Feb 29 04:41:58 <ayecee>	bathtub pumpernickel
Feb 29 04:42:23 <rbox>	that sounds a little unclean
Feb 29 04:43:20 <n4dir>	pmpernickel !
Feb 29 04:43:53 <ayecee>	wow, lifetime max temperature 61C
Feb 29 04:44:32 <dviola>	I'll get rid of it then, thanks for looking at it
Feb 29 04:45:43 <ayecee>	the 61C wasn't even within the last week.
Feb 29 04:49:05 <ayecee>	dmesg says medium error, but it's closer to well done.
Feb 29 04:49:31 <kfrench>	It was no longer happy?
Feb 29 05:24:44 <n4dir>	i guess after pumpernicke no one came up with a better idea.
Feb 29 05:31:47 <ayecee>	it's hard to top pumpernicke
Feb 29 05:32:02 <kfrench>	Cool Whip?
Feb 29 05:34:25 <n4dir>	it is hard.
Feb 29 05:36:47 <n4dir>	Labskaus is a funny word too. Perhaps that

Feb 29 06:18:21 <espresso>	yw!
Feb 29 06:44:56 <FlorianBad>	Is there anything configurable about how much ram ext4 (system and files) uses for caching? What if I have an absurd amount of ram, will it naturally tend to cache a lot or is there some non-default optimizations I could benefit from?
Feb 29 06:50:38 <Bashing-om>	FlorianBad: Linux: No such thing as unused ram -- please too see: http://www.linuxatemyram.com/ :D
Feb 29 06:55:22 <ZLima12>	FlorianBad: basically, Linux will cache files in unused RAM. It will fill 100% of your RAM eventually, and that's okay. When a program asks for some RAM, Linux will drop some caches and hand that RAM over to your program.
Feb 29 06:56:14 <agireud>	FlorianBad: You can adjust the vm.vfs_cache_pressure kernel parameter for caching directory and inode objects.  Might also be worth looking into vm.dirty_ratio and vm.dirty_background_ratio for tuning virtual memory.
Feb 29 06:59:28 <agireud>	You can also tune swap usage with vm.swappiness
Feb 29 07:00:29 <ZLima12>	Ultimately though, you want the caching. Unused RAM is wasted RAM. One of the main reasons that there's the idea of more RAM = faster computer is that it is used for caching.
Feb 29 07:06:55 <buraq>	windows 11 has changed the memory management radically to resemble how linux does it
Feb 29 07:08:00 <eawfaw>	maybe windows 11 is just a desktop manager on top of linux kernel
Feb 29 07:12:29 <Elw3>	And bluescreen is a screensaver?
Feb 29 07:14:33 <FlorianBad>	Bashing-om, oh! Interesting, thanks for that great link :)
Feb 29 07:14:44 <buraq>	it's funny that if you open cmd prompt or windows explorer in win11, it is much slower than on earlier windows versions :)
Feb 29 07:15:22 <buraq>	sorry, not cmd prompt, but the new windows terminal
Feb 29 07:15:25 <Elw3>	Thats the upload lag from sending over your keys.
Feb 29 07:15:46 <FlorianBad>	agireud, ok, but with the defaults it will still cache A LOT if I happen to have a ridiculous amount of ram?
Feb 29 07:15:49 <buraq>	if opening plasma's konsole would take that long, i'd think something's wrong
Feb 29 07:16:08 <Bashing-om>	FlorianBad: :D The link helped me over the hump :P
Feb 29 07:16:19 <FlorianBad>	:)
Feb 29 07:28:55 <agireud>	FloridaMan: Well it depends on what you're trying to achieve.  By increasing the dirty_ratio, you can store more pages in RAM before they start getting flushed and written to the disk.
Feb 29 07:30:46 <agireud>	*dirty_background_ratio
Feb 29 07:32:47 <agireud>	FlorianBad: Geez I'm sleepy I tagged the wrong person lmao
Feb 29 07:34:17 <mlu>	is FlorianBad FloridaMan? :D
Feb 29 07:34:25 <mlu>	they look quite similar on IRC :)
Feb 29 07:35:03 <FlorianBad>	agireud, ok, cool will look into it :)
Feb 29 07:36:25 <FlorianBad>	oh wait you said "and written to disk"? Hmmm, I definitely don't want that, esp. since I use LVM+LUKS, so things should be written as soon as possible, I was thinking about reads, not "waiting before writing"

Feb 29 08:05:50 <jim>	wantyapps, on OFTC, try: #kernelnewbies
Feb 29 08:06:17 <jim>	of all the ones I mentioned, this one has the largest population by far
Feb 29 08:07:09 <wantyapps>	jim thanks! You really helped me
Feb 29 08:08:21 <jim>	wantyapps, one more... on libera, #kernel seems to have a large population as well

Feb 29 08:40:21 <CAT_S>	*purrrrrrrrrr*
Feb 29 08:40:22 <itt788>	i mean the cpu frequency limit
Feb 29 08:41:10 <Disconsented>	The CPU will dynamically adjust its frequency for a variety of reasons, including not limited to load, power and thermal headroom
Feb 29 08:41:37 <xiaomiao>	itt788: I've only seen that in thermal throttling ... is this an intel system?

Feb 29 08:55:37 <cent>	I have created my autoinstall ISO. It boots fine with BIOS/Legacy, but ISO menu is still old.
Feb 29 08:55:53 <cent>	I am using xorriso
Feb 29 08:56:31 <cent>	I mean ISO booting as EFI shows old menu.
Feb 29 08:57:13 <cent>	I suppose I have to update EFI boot image too, but I do not know how. Any hints please? Thank you.
Feb 29 08:57:18 <wantyapps>	Got it. Although an install script can be very custom, I still prefer three cli, as I feel I have much more control over my installation
Feb 29 08:58:40 <wantyapps>	 cent the efi boot is very simple. It's basically manually creating a couple of folders, and installing one other grub package (if I remember correctly)
Feb 29 08:59:20 <mlu>	from a firmware design perspective, the EFI boot is very complexc
Feb 29 08:59:21 <wantyapps>	cent if you have git for the script, I can send a pr
Feb 29 08:59:34 <mlu>	that said, it's much simpler to setup :)
Feb 29 09:00:01 <cent>	wantyapps, OK. What I do is I pick an installation ISO, update its menu to make it autostart and create a new ISO from the altered tree.
Feb 29 09:00:04 <wantyapps>	mlu yes, but it is very simple from an installation perspective
Feb 29 09:00:17 <wantyapps>	 cent got it
Feb 29 09:00:40 <cent>	wantyapps, Let me upload the script.
Feb 29 09:00:48 <mlu>	EFI boot = search hard drives for GPT partition tables, locate specially-marked EFI system partitions (type 0xef00), parse as FAT32, try finding bootable code on there in the default locations (i.e. BOOTX64/BOOTX64.EFI)
Feb 29 09:01:22 <mlu>	whereas for BIOS boot, it's simply: search hard drives and look at their first sector, and if it has code there, run it
Feb 29 09:01:52 <mlu>	but that first sector is special: it's not part of any partition, and it's not part of any file
Feb 29 09:02:08 <wantyapps>	mlu from what I remember from my kernel project, you're dead-on
Feb 29 09:02:25 <mlu>	I was the boot disks guy at my previous company
Feb 29 09:02:51 <mlu>	spent several hours reading the specs -- both for BIOS and EFI, as well as uboot
Feb 29 09:03:02 <suid_dumpable>	on most machines EFI boot also works with mbr partitioning. it just needs to find the EFI system partition.
Feb 29 09:03:05 <wantyapps>	mlu well, I am 14.. IT is at a later stage ;]
Feb 29 09:03:19 <mlu>	wantyapps: oh cool, I didn't know how such magic worked when I was 14 :P
Feb 29 09:03:42 <mlu>	wantyapps: other than knowing that the boot sector was something special you had to target back then
Feb 29 09:03:48 <wantyapps>	mlu information on the subject is much more open nowadays
Feb 29 09:04:04 <mlu>	I'd aruge that it was just as open back then, if you knew were to look
Feb 29 09:04:14 <wantyapps>	 wow, after some time, returning to IRC is really good for my heart :))
Feb 29 09:04:21 <mlu>	TLDP was plenty good -- the guide I used back then was the Linux from power up to shell prompt

Feb 29 09:06:37 *	wantyapps slaps wantyapps around a bit with a large trout
Feb 29 09:06:46 <mlu>	remember when everyone used mIRC? :D
Feb 29 09:07:08 <mlu>	or for the cool people, EPIC and BX
Feb 29 09:07:12 <wantyapps>	i think I wasn't around computers at the time..
Feb 29 09:07:20 <suid_dumpable>	never used mirc :) but of course i know the large trout phrase
Feb 29 09:07:22 <mlu>	wantyapps: when did you first use computers? and when did you first code?
Feb 29 09:07:39 <mlu>	I was born in 1990 but was lucy enough to have access to computers as a baby
Feb 29 09:07:49 <mlu>	learned the alphabet on the keyboard
Feb 29 09:08:06 <wantyapps>	mlu, to ensure future conversations: email at me@wantyapps.xyz. I will probably be here again in 4 hours. (Local time in Israel 10:08)
Feb 29 09:08:09 <mlu>	but I know several peers whose first computer experience invovled Windows XP
Feb 29 09:08:12 <wantyapps>	mlu lold
Feb 29 09:08:19 <mlu>	wantyapps: lol
Feb 29 09:09:12 <wantyapps>	mlu how much is your total uptime on irc? Mine's (I think) is approx. 100hrs
Feb 29 09:09:13 *	mlu has a home server that he uses to maintain a (near) permanent presence here
Feb 29 09:09:15 <unlaudable>	date -d "$((50-14)) years ago"
Feb 29 09:09:15 <unlaudable>	Mon 29 Feb 10:07:35 SAST 1988
Feb 29 09:09:35 <mlu>	wantyapps: lost count -- other than the occasional disconnect, I've gone several months
Feb 29 09:10:00 *	wantyapps has a server hosted at vultr, and domain at GoDaddy, totalling just over 5$ a month
Feb 29 09:10:10 <unlaudable>	I was 14 in 1988... <Insert eye roll emoji here>
Feb 29 09:10:33 <wantyapps>	mlu gotcha. I might just go permanently connect on my second screen, the convos here are really nice
Feb 29 09:10:38 <mlu>	have a number of servesr around, but my IRC is just a Raspberry PI 4 running off PoE+ /w USB C backup power
Feb 29 09:10:41 <wantyapps>	unlaudable lol
Feb 29 09:11:00 <mlu>	and both of those are plugged into a UPS that I've calculated to handle up to 4hr of power outages
Feb 29 09:11:04 <wantyapps>	mlu huh! I have no experience with pis
Feb 29 09:11:14 <mlu>	wantyapps: it's just a small computer
Feb 29 09:11:22 <wantyapps>	 except for my current math degree... Hehe
Feb 29 09:11:27 <wantyapps>	mlu, I know what a pi is
Feb 29 09:11:38 <mlu>	wantyapps: when I was your age, I had a home server, but it was loud and noisy, and I had to beg my parents to allow me to run it / get better internet
Feb 29 09:11:52 <wantyapps>	 wow..
Feb 29 09:12:18 <wantyapps>	 Sorry fort slow typing, using thelounge on phone
Feb 29 09:12:23 <wantyapps>	 for**
Feb 29 09:12:42 <mlu>	first home server was an AMD K6-II, 550MHz (single-core, of course), 512MB RAM, 80GB HDD
Feb 29 09:12:45 *	unlaudable is happy to see youngsters around ;-)
Feb 29 09:12:57 *	mlu is also glad to see youngsters around
Feb 29 09:13:09 <wantyapps>	actually smiling, this chart is really really nice
Feb 29 09:13:28 *	wantyapps is sitting in a crammed bus on the way to uni
Feb 29 09:13:33 <suid_dumpable>	it's a pie chart. no, a pi chat :)
Feb 29 09:13:43 <wantyapps>	:D
Feb 29 09:13:46 <mlu>	wantyapps: what type of math degree?
Feb 29 09:14:02 <mlu>	wantyapps: I tried to double-major in pure mathematics but found out I wasn't interested enough, so I took the minor and ran with it
Feb 29 09:14:17 <wantyapps>	mlu what do you mean? I am currently in the second year of B.Sc.
Feb 29 09:14:32 <wantyapps>	oh right, I am doing pure, not applied
Feb 29 09:14:47 <wantyapps>	 sorry, just in Israel they have much different names
Feb 29 09:14:54 <mlu>	wantyapps: have you figured out if you wanted to focus on analysis, algebra, or topology?
Feb 29 09:15:20 <wantyapps>	 honestly, Analysis is a really cool subject. Probably would choose real Analysis
Feb 29 09:15:29 <mlu>	fun :D
Feb 29 09:16:36 <wantyapps>	 the reason for me being able to learn for a degree at age 14, is because the Open Uni in Israel accepts 9th graders for range of science degrees
Feb 29 09:16:51 <wantyapps>	openu.ac.il
Feb 29 09:16:54 <mlu>	nice
Feb 29 09:17:11 <mlu>	mm, I think I was doing my intro to Calculus back then
Feb 29 09:17:25 <wantyapps>	is ther a different room for unrelated convos? I think we are clogging this channel up
Feb 29 09:17:37 <mlu>	oh, there's plenty of rooms
Feb 29 09:17:51 <wantyapps>	 mlu wow... Currently doing calc 2. Passed with 100 the calc 1 course
Feb 29 09:18:02 <mlu>	but the general culture here, as far as I've seen, is that it's OK to go off-topic as long as nobody is actually doing any on-topic chat
Feb 29 09:18:22 <mlu>	wantyapps: ah, so multivariable calculus?
Feb 29 09:18:44 <wantyapps>	mlu, can I have your email?
Feb 29 09:18:50 <wantyapps>	mlu exactly
Feb 29 09:19:10 <mlu>	I think there's a #mathematics here
Feb 29 09:19:30 <wantyapps>	 that's good to know.
Feb 29 09:19:31 <jim>	wantyapps, calc 1 is single variable differentiation? and calc 2 is single var integration?
Feb 29 09:19:44 <mlu>	I lvoed Calculus -- everything just made so much sense when you see it applied with physics
Feb 29 09:20:08 <mlu>	and it's nice to be able to apply it at work once in a while :)
Feb 29 09:20:48 <wantyapps>	jim, good to see you back. Calc 1 (here) is basic single-var int. and dif, and calc 2 is just more advanced, with multiple vars
Feb 29 09:21:19 <wantyapps>	mlu nice to hear it has actual applications that are not calculating velocity
Feb 29 09:21:32 <mlu>	wantyapps: electromagnetics and economics
Feb 29 09:21:53 <mlu>	but most commonly, I do in fact use it for calculating velocity -- don't be surprised at what you need to do make user interfaces bounce around
Feb 29 09:21:58 <wantyapps>	  wow! My dream is to have an EE degree and job
Feb 29 09:22:11 *	mlu has an EE degree but codes for a living
Feb 29 09:22:39 <wantyapps>	mlu jim and others, arrived at the campus, will be leaving in a couple. See y'all in around four hours
Feb 29 09:23:01 *	mlu will be going to sleepin a few
Feb 29 09:23:11 *	mlu is in San Francisco and it's 0023 here
Feb 29 09:23:19 <wantyapps>	mlu wow. If you visit my site wantyapps.xyz and learn about my hobbies, you'll see why I want ee
Feb 29 09:25:20 *	mlu laments about his oudated personal site :P
Feb 29 09:25:36 *	wantyapps acknowledges mlu and is leaving
Feb 29 09:25:37 <mlu>	ah, cgit, nice taste :)
Feb 29 09:26:46 <wantyapps>	More info about me on qrz.com/db/4X5AU. Bye!
Feb 29 09:27:23 *	mlu still needs to get his radio license
Feb 29 09:41:01 <karstenk>	How could wg allowed ips in loaded instance be different to allowedIPs in conf file?
Feb 29 09:43:15 <jim>	you're comparing the IPs in a loaded instance (of?), to the IPs in a conf file... (which? including full path)
Feb 29 09:45:09 <karstenk>	wg does show only one subnet with command wg under section allowed ips, but Ive configured 3 in conf file
Feb 29 09:47:46 <karstenk>	with one client "allowed ips: 192.168.10.0/24"  and the other like configured "allowed ips: 10.5.0.0/24, 172.22.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24"
Feb 29 09:49:03 <karstenk>	it can not rely by the client, cause wg also shows only one when server restarted and client never connected
Feb 29 09:49:09 <karstenk>	iam confused
Feb 29 09:49:32 <jim>	I dunno how this correlates to -clients-... but 192.168.10.0/24" means 254 ips
Feb 29 09:53:11 <jim>	karstenk, sorry but I don't have enough knowledge to unconfuse you (I do'nt think)
Feb 29 09:57:42 <eqw>	why not make /tmp a separate filesystem? That would allow / to be read-only. Nevertheless, ubuntu installer doesn't even suggest such a mount point
Feb 29 09:58:31 <mlu>	eqw: my /tmp is tmpfs :)
Feb 29 09:59:50 <tripstah>	hi! i don't know if this is an appropriate question for this channel, but couldn't find a more suitable one! i'm looking for a spotify podcast downloader for ubuntu (or web-based), anyone know of a one?
Feb 29 10:01:50 <eqw>	mlu: i'm asking for cons, not for pros
Feb 29 10:02:44 <jasassin>	what is a news:// link? what opens it im not having much luck on google
Feb 29 10:03:21 <eqw>	jasassin: usenet
Feb 29 10:03:24 <eqw>	nntp
Feb 29 10:03:31 <jasassin>	ah!! ok thanks!
Feb 29 10:05:15 <mlu>	eqw: there isn't much cons in separating it out other than more complexity in configuration
Feb 29 10:05:59 <mlu>	eqw: let's say you don't have much RAM, so you need a physical /tmp -- it's gonna be annoying if you size it wrong
Feb 29 10:07:31 <eqw>	i'm gonna have it on thin lv so it's unlikely to have wrong size
Feb 29 10:08:12 <eqw>	is there any reason to have /usr as separate partition?
Feb 29 10:10:16 <rukus>	eqw: there are reasons, I guess you need to see what your needs are. One of the reasons I like /usr seperate if for ssd caching (/usr is not written often, good candidate for caching) but obviously not needed if whole systems ssd. As an example.
Feb 29 10:11:27 <rukus>	also you might like using /usr/local/ .. whch is seperate to your question but falls under, you might want /usr/local to survive full system upgrades.
Feb 29 10:13:24 <eqw>	good reasons

Feb 29 11:26:34 <unlaudable>	sftp and http are different protocols, so it won't work... unless wget has a --sftp option, which I don't see
Feb 29 11:27:48 <ZAJDAN>	loganlee:  it returns Unsupported scheme ‘sftp’
Feb 29 11:27:50 <loganlee>	-S is verbose but only for FTP and HTTP
Feb 29 11:27:56 <loganlee>	ZAJDAN, oh ok
Feb 29 11:28:29 <itt788>	so guys
Feb 29 11:31:52 <unlaudable>	ZAJDAN: sftp sftp://HOST:PORT/PATH/TO/FILE ./
Feb 29 11:32:18 <unlaudable>	ZAJDAN: sftp HOST:PORT/PATH/TO/FILE ./ I think this should work
Feb 29 11:32:59 <Artfaith>	I would suggest Rclone instead.
Feb 29 11:33:10 <Artfaith>	i.e. https://rclone.org/sftp/
Feb 29 11:33:29 <Artfaith>	Greetings, dear Everyone! ^^
Feb 29 11:39:30 <ZAJDAN>	unlaudable: not sftp have to be 'sftp -P 1234 my-user@ftp.server.net:/path/whereitis/'
Feb 29 11:40:13 <unlaudable>	Yeah there you go
Feb 29 11:45:11 <steering>	it's always annoyed me that ssh takes -p, but sftp and scp take -P
Feb 29 11:45:25 <peac>	same
Feb 29 11:53:43 <jasassin>	new fear unlocked: unicode period pretending to be a file extension separator
Feb 29 11:54:59 <peac>	damn, why did you have to share that, i have enough nightmares already
Feb 29 12:00:31 <rukus>	wait what ?
Feb 29 12:03:01 <yustin>	lol
Feb 29 12:06:49 <peac>	a dot in ascii is 0x002e in hexadecimal, and there's a dot in UTF8 that is 0x2024 in hex
Feb 29 12:07:54 <fb`>	also, beware the not-a-forward-slash U+2215 when clicking a link
Feb 29 12:08:19 <peac>	even worse, according to this they both "should work" for extension of a filename, which means you won't find that file if you're looking for ascii dot https://superuser.com/a/1645935
Feb 29 12:08:59 <peac>	or trying to regex its name
Feb 29 12:13:17 <carpenter>	a couple of months ago all of a sudden I had to start using a password to mount a disk why is this?
Feb 29 12:14:35 <phogg>	more details needed
Feb 29 12:14:56 <phogg>	What password? When are you asked? Is the disk encrypted?
Feb 29 12:26:15 <van2024>	What programs for Linux need improvement and bug fixes?
Feb 29 12:31:30 <peac>	most software in linux has open issues in their respective git repos that you could work on
Feb 29 12:32:20 <peac>	if you're willing to help improve, i'd suggest picking software that you use, like or have interest in, and checking their repo
Feb 29 12:38:32 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 29 12:38:33 *	litharge sets ban on $a:peter-cauc$##fix_your_connection
Feb 29 12:38:43 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 29 12:39:21 <Helenah>	How insecure is shellinabox really? I'm wanting to have such internet accessible on its own dedicated box incase I've no other way into my LAN from whatever remote location I find myself in.
Feb 29 12:41:53 <fweht>	whats a common rsync alternative for sftp (no ssh)?  i basically only want filename comparison and skipping file transfers when an equally named file is present at the target location...
Feb 29 12:42:18 <peer>	Helenah: just have a wireguard endpoint you can hit somewhere
Feb 29 12:42:22 <peer>	that's what i do
Feb 29 12:42:35 <Helenah>	peer: I already use wireguard.
Feb 29 12:42:43 *	Helenah checks if it uses TCP
Feb 29 12:42:54 <Helenah>	If it uses TCP, I could put it on port 80 or 443...
Feb 29 12:42:54 <peac>	wireguard uses udp
Feb 29 12:43:03 <Helenah>	Like all VPNs and it makes sense.
Feb 29 12:43:13 <peac>	openvpn can use tcp
Feb 29 12:43:39 <Helenah>	peac: So what do you mean by "endpoint somewhere"?
Feb 29 12:43:51 <peac>	i was not the one saying that
Feb 29 12:44:07 <Helenah>	Woops
Feb 29 12:44:17 <Helenah>	Both nicks show up blue and almost the same... sorry!
Feb 29 12:44:17 <peac>	Helenah: i guess that would mostly depend on how secure is your access to that service, if it's open to public then you have a shell access out in the open, if it's behind mTLS then it's much more secure
Feb 29 12:44:29 <peac>	np
Feb 29 12:44:32 <Helenah>	peer: Do I... know you? Are you "Rails/EvilNirvana"?
Feb 29 12:45:57 <peac>	for this usecase i use both twingate and zerotier to make sure i can remote home
Feb 29 12:46:16 <Helenah>	hmm
Feb 29 12:46:25 <peer>	Helenah: yes ma'am
Feb 29 12:46:40 <Helenah>	Long time, no chat then! :D
Feb 29 12:46:44 <peer>	indeed
Feb 29 12:48:21 <eqw>	when install ubuntu it allows to see so called "Full installer output". Is it available as a textfile?
Feb 29 12:51:15 <Helenah>	Also has anyone here set up reverse proxies for apache2? This seems to hang: http://helservers.net/
Feb 29 12:51:41 <Helenah>	Lemme get a config
Feb 29 12:51:41 <peac>	i use traefik for that
Feb 29 12:52:04 <peac>	i get instant response on this page
Feb 29 12:52:37 <Helenah>	https://termbin.com/3z8v
Feb 29 12:53:13 <peac>	i don't see any issue here
Feb 29 12:53:18 <Helenah>	Same here...
Feb 29 12:53:27 <Helenah>	But the backend server is showing ZERO issue.
Feb 29 12:53:46 <ananke>	Helenah: what's the actual symptom?
Feb 29 12:53:54 <peac>	what do you mean it seems to hang ? you're trying to hit it from local net ?
Feb 29 12:54:49 <Helenah>	ananke: Not sure, it just hangs, and nothing is giving me a clue in the logs.
Feb 29 12:55:01 <Helenah>	peac: I literally mean it hangs on loading in the web browser.
Feb 29 12:55:07 <ananke>	Helenah: show us `curl -w 3 -v http://helservers.net/`
Feb 29 12:55:07 <rukus>	mtu
Feb 29 12:55:10 <peac>	does it hang with curl ?
Feb 29 12:55:43 <Helenah>	Yep, on the body, but I get the header.
Feb 29 12:55:47 <silly>	i can listen to http://helservers.net/music/niche.ogg
Feb 29 12:55:56 <Helenah>	silly: Yes, that works.
Feb 29 12:55:58 <ananke>	Helenah: 'show' does not mean 'interpret'
Feb 29 12:57:10 <Helenah>	https://termbin.com/poeg
Feb 29 12:57:28 <Helenah>	I'm sure this was easier to do on datacentre servers...
Feb 29 12:58:22 <wantyapps>	Hi everyone! Back from campus. I'm moving over to #kernel
Feb 29 12:58:30 <Helenah>	Eh?
Feb 29 12:58:42 <Helenah>	Can you not be in both channels?
Feb 29 12:58:49 <Helenah>	It's not the 80s anymore. :D
Feb 29 12:59:40 <peac>	Helenah: are you hitting that from inside your network ? can you try from a vps ?
Feb 29 13:00:00 <Helenah>	peac: I don't have a VPS/dedi/colo.
Feb 29 13:00:16 <Helenah>	Everything including domain is hosted internally here.
Feb 29 13:00:37 <peac>	what's your networking infrastructure like ?
Feb 29 13:00:39 <ananke>	Helenah: you're not behind a cgnat or anything like that?
Feb 29 13:01:06 <Helenah>	ananke: Dedicated public static IPs to different servers.
Feb 29 13:01:09 <Helenah>	There is no NATs
Feb 29 13:01:47 <ananke>	Helenah: can you access said system by that IP? say ping, ssh? traceroute?
Feb 29 13:01:47 <wantyapps>	Helenah right. :D
Feb 29 13:02:27 <Helenah>	ananke: Perfectly fine, every other service works, ns1, and ns2 works, VPN server works, SSH on everything works, apache2 works until I set it up as a proxy to my backend web services.
Feb 29 13:03:22 <wantyapps>	Since I don't seem to get a response in #kernel, I will ask here: I was away from the contributors' mailing lists for a while, and it seems like they moved the addresses? I didn't get any new message starting from Sep. 2023
Feb 29 13:03:41 <Helenah>	wantyapps: Just ask here, seriously.
Feb 29 13:04:08 <ananke>	Helenah: my next step would be to look at the actual traffic, on both your client, front-end server, and backend one, to see if it everything actually reaches the backend, and you get any replies on the client /proxy
Feb 29 13:04:35 <Helenah>	ananke: Well silly was able to access my music which is on a backend server, the one I showed in the config.
Feb 29 13:04:47 <Helenah>	But yeah, I can look further.
Feb 29 13:04:50 <ananke>	Helenah: we all can. except you
Feb 29 13:04:57 <Helenah>	Ugh?!
Feb 29 13:04:57 <wantyapps>	Helenah, The mailing lists are mainly designed for sending raw patch files for fixes and features, not questions. That's why it's important to me
Feb 29 13:05:01 *	Helenah pauses music
Feb 29 13:05:12 <Helenah>	You can access the root?
Feb 29 13:05:17 *	wantyapps starts Helenah's music again
Feb 29 13:05:23 <ananke>	Helenah: yes. so can peac.
Feb 29 13:05:24 <peac>	root and music folder yes
Feb 29 13:05:42 <peac>	instantly
Feb 29 13:05:49 <Helenah>	Ah yeah
Feb 29 13:05:54 <Helenah>	I have a fix for this, thanks
Feb 29 13:06:09 <wantyapps>	Are y'all talking about mpd?
Feb 29 13:06:09 <ananke>	Helenah: which makes it a problem specific to your location. cgnat + lack of hairpin routing would be one of the more common causes
Feb 29 13:07:01 <peac>	maybe something funky with the dns solving if it tries to resolve locally, times out and then asks a public server
Feb 29 13:07:27 <ananke>	peac: that's why I asked for the output of curl. it looks normal, it shows the same IP
Feb 29 13:08:11 <wantyapps>	One sec, reconnecting from other client
Feb 29 13:09:08 <Helenah>	Here you go: https://termbin.com/0dam
Feb 29 13:09:58 <Helenah>	My clients are behind a NAT though.
Feb 29 13:10:54 <wantyapps7>	Back
Feb 29 13:10:59 <wantyapps7>	wait
Feb 29 13:11:12 <ananke>	Helenah: https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/helservers.net?proto=http
Feb 29 13:12:17 <ananke>	Helenah: the problem is confined to your clients and their networking. like I said, you can try tcpdump to see what's happening traffic wise
Feb 29 13:12:37 *	wantyapps is back
Feb 29 13:13:03 <peac>	Helenah: please describe your physical network, routers and servers
Feb 29 13:14:25 <ananke>	not sure that would be helpful at this point, without further data
Feb 29 13:15:25 <peac>	sometimes we miss something obvious like a network loop between switches
Feb 29 13:15:52 <dostoyevsky2>	Is it secure to insert a random usb stick in my laptop in order to format it?  I guess the USB stick could just try to replace any usb device
Feb 29 13:16:10 <dostoyevsky2>	and there's not much Linux could do about it
Feb 29 13:16:35 <peac>	dostoyevsky2: i have a usb stick that pretends to be any other peripheral. i have another one that will fry your hardware
Feb 29 13:16:49 <Helenah>	peac: Well to get to helservers.net from here, traffic has to go through 10.1.1.1 which is a router that the clients (these use it as a default gateway and it acts as a NAT) and the servers (these don't use it as a default gateway but it manages their public IPs) have to go through to communicate with each other. https://termbin.com/vaz8
Feb 29 13:16:58 <Helenah>	peac: ^
Feb 29 13:17:11 <dostoyevsky2>	peac: Yeah, so should I get another physical laptop in order to securely format it?
Feb 29 13:17:24 <dostoyevsky2>	I guess I could use a rpi or so
Feb 29 13:17:25 <Helenah>	But yeah, maybe I should check things out with tcpdump.
Feb 29 13:18:00 <peac>	dostoyevsky2: using a raspi sounds more reasonable, and i would boot it on tails just to be sure
Feb 29 13:18:36 <wantyapps>	May I ask what the problem is?
Feb 29 13:18:36 <hodapp>	one can run Tails on a Pi?
Feb 29 13:19:06 <dostoyevsky2>	peac: but even if I were to format it on a disposable rpi, it doesn't mean that it would be safe to use in my normal laptop
Feb 29 13:19:06 <wantyapps>	Hodapp one can run tails on a potato, if one wanted
Feb 29 13:19:42 <dostoyevsky2>	I guess the safest is to just throw it away
Feb 29 13:19:45 <peac>	dostoyevsky2: it could pretend to be a usb key when you format it, and then be something else when you plug it to your laptop
Feb 29 13:19:57 <peac>	but i'm the paranoid guy
Feb 29 13:20:00 <hodapp>	wantyapps: I'm not talking about theoretical possibility given an infinite amount of effort, but whether it has a version that will run on that architecture given a comparable amount of work as x86
Feb 29 13:20:32 <wantyapps>	Hodapp I believe so.
Feb 29 13:20:40 <Helenah>	Seriously, for a consumer, I have an unusual setup.
Feb 29 13:20:56 <hodapp>	wantyapps: it's only x86_64 from what I've seen
Feb 29 13:20:57 <peac>	Helenah: that's that we call a homelab
Feb 29 13:21:09 <Helenah>	Yeah
Feb 29 13:21:20 <wantyapps>	hodapp welp
Feb 29 13:21:45 <wantyapps>	helenah what are you discussing? Safety of USB drives?
Feb 29 13:21:52 <hodapp>	but yeah, if you want to stick random USB devices in, probably best to do it on a craptop and/or desktop you don't care about
Feb 29 13:22:22 <Helenah>	wantyapps: No, just network issues.
Feb 29 13:22:32 <dostoyevsky2>	peac: Or maybe I could just scp my data from a laptop via  rpi
Feb 29 13:22:41 <rossi42>	1;7C1;7A1;7D
Feb 29 13:23:23 <peac>	hodapp: good point i never thought tails didn't have an arm build
Feb 29 13:23:33 <wantyapps>	 Helena got it, thanks
Feb 29 13:24:48 <dostoyevsky2>	peac: I could run OpenBSD on the rpi
Feb 29 13:24:52 <hangint3n>	morning ladies & gents
Feb 29 13:26:02 <dviola>	what's a good way to destroy a hdd?
Feb 29 13:26:09 <peac>	dostoyevsky2: or any live system for that matter, it was just interesting to use tail's guarantee of not touching the drives
Feb 29 13:26:09 <wantyapps>	Morning hangint3n
Feb 29 13:26:21 <peac>	dviola: microwave and drill
Feb 29 13:26:24 <wantyapps>	dviola 9mm
Feb 29 13:27:06 <dviola>	would dumping it from a third floor do anything to it?
Feb 29 13:27:10 <Helenah>	Do I honestly need hairpin?
Feb 29 13:27:23 <peac>	dviola: not guaranteed
Feb 29 13:27:26 <lemonzest>	Helenah: my router supports hairpinnig
Feb 29 13:27:39 <dviola>	peac, wantyapps: don't have any of those at my disposal at the moment
Feb 29 13:27:52 <peac>	dviola: a less dramatic way would be to do a 10 pass write of 0's
Feb 29 13:27:52 <Helenah>	lemonzest: Which router do you even have?
Feb 29 13:27:54 <wantyapps>	dviola yeah, there's a chance the disk in it will survive. I advise drilling into it
Feb 29 13:28:08 <lemonzest>	Helenah: ASUS GT-AX6000 Wifi 6
Feb 29 13:28:14 <wantyapps>	peace: also true
Feb 29 13:28:14 <Helenah>	Ah
Feb 29 13:28:24 <lemonzest>	Using Merlin Firmware
Feb 29 13:28:43 <Helenah>	Ah
Feb 29 13:28:49 <Helenah>	Jeebus, I'm in pain.
Feb 29 13:29:27 <lemonzest>	I know the feeling :( woke up shit this morning, ain't gotten any better
Feb 29 13:29:57 <peac>	i feel better since i thrown up yesterday's drinks
Feb 29 13:31:08 <hodapp>	dviola: realistically, zero-fill will make it completely unreadable, but if you're really paranoid, just smash the crap out of it and/or take a torch to the platters
Feb 29 13:31:10 <hangint3n>	i wake up in pain everyday since 1978
Feb 29 13:31:22 <scottpedia>	hangint3n: why?
Feb 29 13:31:37 <peac>	life
Feb 29 13:31:43 <peac>	it hurts
Feb 29 13:32:26 <dostoyevsky2>	peac: On another note, I always wanted to create my own yubi-key like stick.  I was thinking of something small running Linux that you can insert into a usb port and that will then pretend to be a keyboard and send some keypresses
Feb 29 13:32:30 <scottpedia>	peac: i don't think so
Feb 29 13:32:42 <hodapp>	dostoyevsky2: that's definitely a thing
Feb 29 13:33:27 <peac>	dostoyevsky2: i use hak5 hardware for this kind of things, but actually found it pretty limited, at some point i'll make my own
Feb 29 13:33:32 <dviola>	hodapp: I already filled it with zeroes but after doing hexdumping it some data ended up coming back (I've not checked which or if it was my data), but the hdd crashed because it's currently broken (bad sectors)
Feb 29 13:33:47 <dviola>	-doing
Feb 29 13:34:06 <hangint3n>	injured my back working in a warehouse
Feb 29 13:34:14 <dostoyevsky2>	hodapp: I see that there is a usb stick extension board to mount a rpi zero
Feb 29 13:34:38 <hangint3n>	compressed vertibras and arthitis
Feb 29 13:35:31 <ballsxd>	hey peac, the scan yesterday took too long so i just quit it lol
Feb 29 13:36:26 <peac>	ballsxd: something somewhere has to call those terms between your boot and the moment your desktop is done loading
Feb 29 13:36:39 <peac>	did you have a chance to reboot without xfce ?
Feb 29 13:39:54 <wantyapps>	Anyone here using irc via tty?
Feb 29 13:40:34 <ballsxd>	i did (to install funny grub theme)
Feb 29 13:40:48 <wantyapps>	Hehe
Feb 29 13:40:49 <ballsxd>	without running xfce i started x, which in fact showed the terminals
Feb 29 13:40:50 <eqw>	mosh tmux
Feb 29 13:40:58 <wantyapps>	Whoa
Feb 29 13:41:04 <eqw>	so it's pty, not tty
Feb 29 13:41:09 <wantyapps>	i prefer ssh over mosh
Feb 29 13:41:15 <ballsxd>	moshpit?
Feb 29 13:41:18 <wantyapps>	i tried mosh and it seemed
Feb 29 13:41:27 <ballsxd>	i like moshpits
Feb 29 13:41:27 <wantyapps>	Quite... Clunky
Feb 29 13:41:30 <ballsxd>	and ssh
Feb 29 13:41:55 <fdan>	 sudo -H -u ec2-user nohup forever_running_process > nohup.out 2>&1 &
Feb 29 13:41:56 <fdan>	there is a script which we run by doing the above command
Feb 29 13:41:56 <fdan>	now this creates 2 processes one with sudo and a child process without sudo.
Feb 29 13:41:57 <fdan>	when we want to kill a process? which PID should we use. i know the way the command is started is not nice.
Feb 29 13:41:58 <peac>	ballsxd: so it has to be a service or x init
Feb 29 13:42:07 <ballsxd>	perhaps
Feb 29 13:42:21 <hangint3n>	so after a week of tinkering i mananged to get my rpi media server running with minidlna. serving 1900+ music files.
Feb 29 13:42:37 <Helenah>	I'm not understanding why I need hairpin...
Feb 29 13:42:40 <ballsxd>	peac: would you like a list of my services?
Feb 29 13:43:07 <peac>	ballsxd: you can send it but you'd mostly have to look into the service scripts
Feb 29 13:43:17 <peac>	you could grep only /etc
Feb 29 13:43:23 <peac>	that would be faster
Feb 29 13:43:40 <ballsxd>	https://0x0.st/HR3x.txt
Feb 29 13:43:59 <ballsxd>	are you familliar with runit?
Feb 29 13:44:31 <peac>	i'm not
Feb 29 13:44:43 <peac>	any docker container using x to render terms ?
Feb 29 13:44:58 <ballsxd>	nothing that should
Feb 29 13:45:01 <amurana>	do you use void-linux, ballsxd?
Feb 29 13:45:09 <ballsxd>	yes amurana
Feb 29 13:45:32 <amurana>	how do you manage your user services with runit?
Feb 29 13:45:41 <amurana>	i'm starting to use void and i have some trouble with that
Feb 29 13:45:47 <ballsxd>	fair
Feb 29 13:46:29 <ballsxd>	i symlink a service from /var/service to /etc/sv
Feb 29 13:46:51 <ballsxd>	at which point runit recognizes it as a service and i can sv start foo
Feb 29 13:47:33 <amurana>	but that stats as a system service, isn't?
Feb 29 13:48:00 <ballsxd>	sorry didnt read "user" in your last messasge
Feb 29 13:48:09 <peac>	good point ballsxd did you check your user services
Feb 29 13:48:27 <ballsxd>	honestly, i have no idea how i even would peac
Feb 29 13:48:54 <ballsxd>	i just use one user (me) and create additional users if a program requires/recommends it
Feb 29 13:49:08 <ballsxd>	ie, vsftpd or the likes
Feb 29 13:49:15 <amurana>	hm, i want to use syncthing which needs to start as a user service (at least in systemd distros)
Feb 29 13:49:31 <amurana>	anyways i cant start just running # syncthing so i think i would just setup a script
Feb 29 13:49:41 <amurana>	thanks anyways!
Feb 29 13:49:58 <peac>	amurana: doesn't runit let you specify the user that should run a system service ?
Feb 29 13:50:01 <ballsxd>	why can't you start with just the command syncthing?
Feb 29 13:50:18 <peac>	ballsxd: all i can say is that systemd uses ~/.config/systemd/user to store user services
Feb 29 13:50:36 <amurana>	i want to have as a service so it can persist between reboots and sync in background
Feb 29 13:51:07 <ballsxd>	fair amurana, i have yet to find a fix for it myself but haven't been bothered so i just make simple scripts
Feb 29 13:51:56 <ballsxd>	amurana: have you read this? https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/services/user-services.html
Feb 29 13:51:58 <amurana>	there's some doc about it in the wiki but i didn't manage to get it working
Feb 29 13:52:35 <amurana>	ballsxd: yes, that is the doc i mentioned but i didn't manage to get it working
Feb 29 13:53:13 <ballsxd>	hmm, i have to say that it goes a little above my head aswell
Feb 29 13:53:20 <wantyapps>	Is there a way to get multiple screen support in  the tty? My two screens seem to be mirrored. In X, I created an arandr config
Feb 29 13:54:03 <a51>	how is  everyone doing
Feb 29 13:54:08 <ballsxd>	amurana: you could ask in their channel #voidlinux. FWIW theyre somehwat active
Feb 29 13:54:26 <Helenah>	wantyapps: Not that I know of but things may have changed or there maybe something I'm unaware of regarding that.
Feb 29 13:54:42 <wantyapps>	Got it, thanks Helenah
Feb 29 13:55:18 <Nalkem>	hello
Feb 29 13:55:19 <wantyapps>	i am getting into tty work, and it would help if it worked :]
Feb 29 13:55:28 <wantyapps>	Nalkem oi
Feb 29 13:55:48 <Nalkem>	is there a (easy) way to convert a file from little to big indian and revert?
Feb 29 13:56:19 <wantyapps>	Isn't the difference just bits being reversed? Nalkem
Feb 29 13:56:59 <Nalkem>	wantyapps, in my case the bytes have to be reverted, not the bits
Feb 29 13:57:10 <wantyapps>	if that's so, I believe there exists a tool for it
Feb 29 13:57:23 <Nalkem>	means: 00aaccdd is now ddccaa00
Feb 29 13:57:24 <wantyapps>	nalkem something along the lines of that :]
Feb 29 13:57:31 <wantyapps>	yup yup
Feb 29 13:58:00 <peac>	Nalkem: a few lines in your favorite programming language would also do the job
Feb 29 13:58:26 <wantyapps>	 yes. Now I want to do that as a side project
Feb 29 13:58:33 <peac>	sorry
Feb 29 14:00:09 *	wantyapps is sad that he has another project to code
Feb 29 14:06:56 <spit>	hi, i resized my boot parititon with gparted, and checked it did infact increase via lsblk, but it shows only a tenth of the size via df -h (probably the old size iirc)
Feb 29 14:07:34 <ananke>	spit: sounds like your filesystem didn't grow
Feb 29 14:08:25 <spit>	ananke: yes i think so, how do i make the filesystem align with the partition change?
Feb 29 14:08:35 <ananke>	spit: that depends on your filesystem type.
Feb 29 14:08:54 <spit>	ananke: its vfat
Feb 29 14:08:56 <billings>	parted can resize the filesystem too, if you tell it to.
Feb 29 14:09:04 <billings>	but I don't know if it can resize vfat
Feb 29 14:09:15 <billings>	(since I rarely touch that FS)
Feb 29 14:09:40 <ananke>	spit: 'fatresize'
Feb 29 14:10:33 <spit>	i assumed they were linked. so whenever i resize a vfat partition, i also have to resize /again/ for the matching file system?
Feb 29 14:10:52 <billings>	pretty much every filesystem is going to have that requirement
Feb 29 14:10:52 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Feb 29 14:11:00 <ayecee>	gparted normally takes care of that if you have the tool installed.
Feb 29 14:11:14 <billings>	ah well, spit left.
Feb 29 14:11:21 <spit>	bit silly
Feb 29 14:11:23 <spit>	dc'd
Feb 29 14:11:28 <Siecje>	`cryptsetup -q luksFormat` fails with “Cannot initialize crypto backend. Failed to set pbkdf parameters.” Am I missing something in the kernel?
Feb 29 14:12:26 <billings>	Siecje: I assume it's cryptsetup create or cryptsetup open?
Feb 29 14:13:06 <billings>	oh luksFormat
Feb 29 14:13:52 <billings>	you probably want to use --pbkdf argon2id

Feb 29 14:16:01 <Sparkles>	They just shared about it in another channel.
Feb 29 14:16:06 <Sparkles>	It works here though.
Feb 29 14:16:13 <Guest60>	ha?
Feb 29 14:16:17 <wantyapps>	Leaving, thanks for all conversations
Feb 29 14:16:19 <hasp>	kek why would someone block a text editor
Feb 29 14:16:35 <Sparkles>	You ask a Nano about it I guess. It's on their side.
Feb 29 14:16:41 <peac>	text editors can code bombs
Feb 29 14:16:45 <billings>	it might be that it shares an IP block or hoster with a site that the Russian government doesn't approve of
Feb 29 14:17:09 <Sparkles>	It's not Russian block. It's Nano's block.
Feb 29 14:17:21 <billings>	did you read what I said?
Feb 29 14:17:26 <Guest89>	??
Feb 29 14:17:44 <Sparkles>	You said Russian government is stupid enough to block a Nano editor domain.
Feb 29 14:18:08 <billings>	I'm saying it might just be an unrelated block
Feb 29 14:18:13 <billings>	it happens a lot
Feb 29 14:18:21 <Sparkles>	For example?
Feb 29 14:18:30 <Sparkles>	What would be another case you know?
Feb 29 14:19:41 <billings>	someone hosts some "IHatePutin.com" with a company ABCInternet.  You site PuppiesAreGreat.ninja is also hosted with ABCInternet.  Russia blocks the entire ABCInternet IP block, and now your domain is unreachable.
Feb 29 14:20:02 <Gurkenglas>	he wants an example case, because thats verifiable
Feb 29 14:20:12 <rascul>	curl: (6) Could not resolve host: puppiesaregreat.ninja
Feb 29 14:20:15 <rascul>	must be blocked here
Feb 29 14:20:25 <Gurkenglas>	*reads my last line* oof, a historical example, that is
Feb 29 14:20:44 <rascul>	was hoping for puppy videos :(
Feb 29 14:21:16 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Feb 29 14:21:17 *	litharge removes ban on *!*@216.54.19.139$##fix_your_connection
Feb 29 14:21:17 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Feb 29 14:21:30 <Sparkles>	billings, I don't see an example but a nonsense.
Feb 29 14:21:52 <rascul>	where is the evidence that it's nano's web site doing the blocking?
Feb 29 14:22:04 <Sparkles>	Anyways, nmap-editor.org ends up at 213.138.109.86 which is also wh0rd.org
Feb 29 14:22:22 <Sparkles>	Both dump traffic on their side, but it works on my side.
Feb 29 14:22:30 <Siecje>	billings: I get the same error.
Feb 29 14:22:41 <Sparkles>	If it would be Russian's fault, it would not traceroute back to their server.
Feb 29 14:24:15 <billings>	I'm trying to remember the last time it happened, for me it's always been ISPs blocking IPs because of a shared hosting site, and it's not something in the news, just because someone was hosting warez on their shared hosting page
Feb 29 14:25:26 <Sparkles>	Their traceroute: https://i.imgur.com/9lZcE1i.png
Feb 29 14:25:54 <rascul>	the map isn't helpful
Feb 29 14:25:55 <TomyWork>	what's an error -71? I'm getting that intermittently on both my usb headset (usb 7-1.4: clear tt 1 (80a0) error -71) and my network interface (r8152 8-1.1.4:1.0 enx00e04cc8b122: Tx status -71). The USB and network ports are on the same USB-C-connected  port extender and have started cropping up after switching to a new laptop. I'm wondering if the device is faulty, the USB-C connection is just slipping or whatever else is going on.
Feb 29 14:26:14 <rascul>	where is traceroute output instead of a map?
Feb 29 14:26:15 <Sparkles>	The traceroute addresses: https://dpaste.org/YyOUi/raw
Feb 29 14:26:33 <TomyWork>	on the headset it usually fixes itself. on the network interface, it requires reconnecting the port extender
Feb 29 14:26:56 <rascul>	depending on things, could be a temp block for some unknown reason and might go away in x amount of time
Feb 29 14:27:31 <billings>	TomyWork: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198931 seems to describe your problem
Feb 29 14:27:45 <billings>	it has some kernel arguments that might be a workaround
Feb 29 14:29:20 <wantyapps>	mlu, you here?
Feb 29 14:30:56 <rascul>	it's often quite impossible to know why something was blocked without hearing from the person/organization who put the block in place
Feb 29 14:33:46 <TomyWork>	billings, old machine had 18.04 (kernel 4.15), new one has 22.04 and the issue is for 4.16-rc2, so that fits
Feb 29 14:33:48 <derk0pf>	hihi
Feb 29 14:33:58 <rascul>	it's also not clear that it's nano doing the blocking since tcp or http could be blocked elsewhere and icmp left unblocked
Feb 29 14:34:16 <billings>	or it could just be a red herring and whoever is reporting it is having weird network issues
Feb 29 14:34:33 <TomyWork>	so am I, so it's worth a try :D
Feb 29 14:35:43 <billings>	I remember many years ago I was working at a university and someone called our IT and complained they couldn't reach any of our sites, and we ended up discovering that the corporation he worked for had assigned the entire /16 assigned to the university as a local subnet
Feb 29 14:36:55 <billings>	(of course, the guy was a foolish individual, and asked *us* to fix it, such as moving all our sites to geocities or something equally absurd)

Feb 29 14:41:10 <djph>	wait, some rando company used your IANA-assigned space as theirs?
Feb 29 14:41:19 <derk0pf>	To human is to have err A very recently tried to connect to ipv6 adress with the suffix/24
Feb 29 14:41:29 <derk0pf>	and wondered why it doesnt work
Feb 29 14:41:35 <billings>	djph: yup
Feb 29 14:41:41 <djph>	derk0pf: biiiiig address space, that :)
Feb 29 14:41:49 <billings>	well, the IT department wasn't involved, just someone trying to download a research paper
Feb 29 14:42:25 <djph>	and this folks is why you don't use fly-by-night IT providers
Feb 29 14:42:27 <djph>	:D
Feb 29 14:42:39 <rascul>	when i fly it's usually by day
Feb 29 14:42:52 <derk0pf>	Night people do have their benefits they are not so neurotic, right
Feb 29 14:44:39 <rascul>	sometimes i'm a night person when i stay up way too late drinking
Feb 29 14:44:43 <TomyWork>	one thing is different vs. all those comments on the bugzilla entry is that these issues usually happen when I bang my table or otherwise physically disturb the connection between my laptop and the port extender or the port extender and the network/usb device
Feb 29 14:44:52 <djph>	"fly-by-night" meaning "bad" (originally meaning someone who'd skip town "at night" to avoid responsibilities / creditors / etc.)
Feb 29 14:45:13 <TomyWork>	bang is in if I'm being clumsy and hit my knee on it
Feb 29 14:45:16 <TomyWork>	as*
Feb 29 14:46:03 <rascul>	TomyWork usb jack connections coming loose perhaps
Feb 29 14:46:21 <Inline>	24 == 40
Feb 29 14:46:41 <rascul>	Inline 1
Feb 29 14:46:53 <Inline>	?
Feb 29 14:47:06 <rascul>	[[ 24 == 40 ]]; echo $?
Feb 29 14:47:15 <Inline>	ah
Feb 29 14:47:29 <TomyWork>	probably, but I dont think it should be that janky in the first place
Feb 29 14:47:43 <rascul>	TomyWork normally it shouldn't
Feb 29 14:48:11 <rascul>	happens in phones sometimes though
Feb 29 14:54:12 <Siecje>	How can I determine if my environment what it needs for crypto operations (luksFormat)?
Feb 29 14:54:45 <TomyWork>	either way, I changed negotiation from ignore to automatic on all wired interfaces and if the problem persists despite this, I'm gonna try usbcore.autosuspend=-1
Feb 29 14:59:20 <billings>	Siecje: what do you mean?
Feb 29 14:59:55 <Siecje>	billings: How can I check if something is loaded or a library is missing or something.
Feb 29 15:00:06 <TomyWork>	does it work?
Feb 29 15:00:19 <billings>	you'll generally get an error at the command line if you try
Feb 29 15:00:36 <billings>	are you still talking about not defining your pbkdf when using luksFormat?
Feb 29 15:01:22 <Masklin>	Can sort not sort by line length?
Feb 29 15:01:33 <Masklin>	I am flabberghasted and mind-boggled.
Feb 29 15:02:53 <TomyWork>	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5917576/sort-a-text-file-by-line-length-including-spaces
Feb 29 15:07:58 <Masklin>	The last answer is OK, TomyWork. Thank you!
Feb 29 15:09:17 <Siecje>	billings: yes
Feb 29 15:09:46 <billings>	did you provide the parameter like it said you needed to do?
Feb 29 15:12:24 <Siecje>	yes same error
Feb 29 15:12:44 <eqw>	is it possible to find out how many blocks of the SSD is not in use due to fstrim or never have been used?
Feb 29 15:13:34 <uwharrie>	eqw: could probably get metrics like that with smartmontools

Feb 29 15:16:03 *	Topic for #linux set by Khaytsus (Thu Aug  3 13:54:32 2023)
Feb 29 15:16:59 <Khaytsus>	I suspect the OS has no idea which blocks are "never used", given the drive internally does wear leveling.
Feb 29 15:20:04 <eqw>	so you do fstrim but you are not 100% confident if it does something?
Feb 29 15:20:58 <Khaytsus>	eqw: What's the real question here?
Feb 29 15:21:53 <eqw>	this is my first SSD so my questions maybe sound stupid
Feb 29 15:22:47 <Khaytsus>	You're overthinking it...  Trim commands are just the OS telling the drive that these blocks are no longer needed.  The drive then does the thing, the OS does nothing more.  "the thing" is erasing them so that they can be directly written to next time without an erase beforehand to make it faster.
Feb 29 15:23:43 <ananke>	eqw: just add appropriate discard option to your filesystem in /etc/fstab (most distros would do it for you during install anyway), and that's it. move on with your life.
Feb 29 15:24:18 <eqw>	i've heard if your SSD is 100% filled and you overwrite this data often then it's more likely to die soon than if it had 30% free
Feb 29 15:24:57 <djph>	no
Feb 29 15:26:21 <peac>	are the writes linear ? if they're not and the data is scattered, free space would effectively reduce wear on individual cells ?
Feb 29 15:27:42 <Khaytsus>	ananke: I don't think that discard mount option is recommended is it?  Has that changed?  It used to cause delays in doing operations that freed blocks in real time.  vs fstrim you can schedule to do overnight or whatever.
Feb 29 15:30:13 <ananke>	Khaytsus: I was under the impression that discard was enabled by various distro installers. not sure what the performance penalty is
Feb 29 15:30:42 <xiaomiao>	it varies a lot
Feb 29 15:30:47 <Khaytsus>	Offhand I mostly see fstrim timers/cron jobs.
Feb 29 15:30:53 <xiaomiao>	most modern flash storage can handle discard in the background
Feb 29 15:30:58 <Khaytsus>	But I don't distro hop so no idea what most distros do
Feb 29 15:31:00 <rascul>	i think opensuse setup the fstrim.timer for me
Feb 29 15:31:16 <xiaomiao>	some OCZ etc. devices were stupidly absurdly slow, some dropping down to 10 IO/s during trim
Feb 29 15:31:27 <xiaomiao>	... try it and see
Feb 29 15:39:15 <Siecje>	billings: In buildroot I can include more crypto files (algorithmns?, libraries?) https://dpaste.org/GAgSg Any you think I should include?
Feb 29 15:41:38 <rascul>	include whatever you use
Feb 29 15:42:48 <Siecje>	billings: Said to use argon2id but I don't see it.
Feb 29 15:43:07 <Siecje>	I'm trying to run cryptsetup -q luksFormat
Feb 29 15:46:53 <Siecje>	Okay I see it not in the kernel but in buildroot menu and it is enabled.
Feb 29 15:54:01 <billings>	iirc we build with --enable-internal-sse-argon2 in Fedora
Feb 29 16:08:55 <Siecje>	with debug I get wrong or missing parameters. https://dpaste.org/hJWsr
Feb 29 16:11:35 <Khaytsus>	Siecje: It is refusing because it already has an ext4 signature......
Feb 29 16:13:31 <Khaytsus>	Hm, actually I guess that would just warn, it'd proceed normally
Feb 29 16:16:01 <ubuntu>	hey guys how's it going?
Feb 29 16:16:39 <vii_majesty>	lol about the nick
Feb 29 16:16:53 <Guest5119>	wut
Feb 29 16:18:01 <Khaytsus>	Siecje: Perhaps your kernel doesn't have some required things in it, I see some google results about CONFIG_CRYPTO_HMAC and CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA1
Feb 29 16:18:02 <Siecje>	Khaytsus: It is an empty partition.
Feb 29 16:19:15 <Siecje>	any idea where to find that in a buildroot project `make linux-menuconfig` menu?
Feb 29 16:19:17 <billings>	are you using glibc in your chroot?
Feb 29 16:19:53 <Siecje>	I looked for glic in make menuconfig I found qlibc `Target packages -> Libraries -> other -> qlibc`
Feb 29 16:20:10 <Siecje>	Khaytsus: hmac is enabled but I can't find sha1
Feb 29 16:20:17 <billings>	uhhh
Feb 29 16:20:25 <billings>	glibc is not part of the kernel
Feb 29 16:20:30 <billings>	the problem isn't your kernel
Feb 29 16:20:34 <Guest5119>	is there a chatroom dedicated to asking question about irc itself?
Feb 29 16:20:37 <Khaytsus>	qlibc?
Feb 29 16:20:55 <billings>	its that you're not building a buildroot that supports those crypto backends in cryptsetup
Feb 29 16:20:56 <Khaytsus>	Guest5119: What questions?
Feb 29 16:20:57 <Siecje>	okay sha1 and hmac are enabled.

Feb 29 16:25:10 <billings>	Siecje: the error you're seeing really depends on how you're building cryptsetup, whether it's using gcrypt, openssl, etc.
Feb 29 16:26:22 <Siecje>	How can I tell? This is the buildroot help. https://dpaste.org/oSvj2
Feb 29 16:27:10 <billings>	I have no idea what that is
Feb 29 16:27:20 <Siecje>	I see a libgcrypt I can include.
Feb 29 16:28:43 <Siecje>	and openlssl support which allows the selection of different algorithms. Should I include both?
Feb 29 16:28:54 <buraq>	looks like this channel is ruled with an iron fist
Feb 29 16:29:22 <Siecje>	buraq: Wasn't on topic.
Feb 29 16:29:35 <buraq>	irc?
Feb 29 16:30:23 <Siecje>	topic of this channel is linux
Feb 29 16:30:33 <djph>	oh I missed our friend from yesterday :(
Feb 29 16:33:35 <Khaytsus>	buraq: You've been told a few times that #linux-ops is the channel to discuss channel operation questions.
Feb 29 16:33:48 <buraq>	Siecje: i've been here for less than a week and the talk hasn't been only linux
Feb 29 16:34:25 <Khaytsus>	djph: And no, not yesterday, that user has been around asking the exact same questions since October.
Feb 29 16:34:33 <Khaytsus>	It's a very strange troll
Feb 29 16:37:07 <djph>	Khaytsus: well, yeah, but I'm not looking *that* far back in my logs
Feb 29 16:37:24 <djph>	Khaytsus: "missed" "friend"
Feb 29 16:37:34 <Khaytsus>	djph: Tooling helps ;)
Feb 29 16:38:18 <djph>	Khaytsus: I have grep, I'm just lazy
Feb 29 16:38:20 <djph>	:D
Feb 29 16:40:31 <espresso>	could be proactively lazy, with a log-grepping alias
Feb 29 16:41:21 <buraq>	Khaytsus: i read the channel rules but they just said offtopic is ok until it's not
Feb 29 16:41:42 <espresso>	but I guess that's not as lazy.  Also the rules include intentionally annoying others
Feb 29 16:42:02 <djph>	espresso: ooh, and send it into watch just for giggles
Feb 29 16:42:09 <djph>	... wait, that's just IRC, but slower...
Feb 29 16:42:19 <ananke>	buraq: so what's the confusion? rule was followed.
Feb 29 16:43:16 <buraq>	ananke: confusion was about that guy kicked out for asking about netsplit.de
Feb 29 16:43:34 <ananke>	buraq: did you miss the part 'going on for months' on purpose?
Feb 29 16:44:06 <buraq>	oh ok
Feb 29 16:44:13 <buraq>	strange
Feb 29 16:50:45 <djph>	yep, some people are definitely that.
Feb 29 16:53:38 <arkanoid>	is there an util to check if files and directories in a directory tree have a specific user:group, without changing it? Like a chmod -R but --dry-run
Feb 29 16:53:59 <Khaytsus>	arkanoid: find?
Feb 29 16:54:21 <arkanoid>	can it search by user:group?
Feb 29 16:54:34 <Khaytsus>	Both usre and group, sure
Feb 29 16:54:45 <Khaytsus>	Or either.  Man page has the info, uid gid I'm sure
Feb 29 16:55:01 <Khaytsus>	can also negate, such as not user 1000 or whatnot
Feb 29 16:55:21 <arkanoid>	thanks, let me check
Feb 29 16:56:52 <arkanoid>	mh, sure there's the --user arg but yet not found how to negate
Feb 29 16:57:10 <Khaytsus>	-not
Feb 29 16:57:18 <arkanoid>	maybe is -not -user
Feb 29 16:57:20 <arkanoid>	gotcha
Feb 29 16:57:27 <Khaytsus>	or -user ! 1000     I think this also works
Feb 29 16:58:42 <Khaytsus>	I use -not though, as ! can do weird stuff in some shells
Feb 29 17:11:29 <bombastick>	whatever happened to akik?
Feb 29 17:11:45 <bombastick>	!seen akik
Feb 29 17:29:38 <arkanoid>	Khaytsus: it works nicely. Thanks!
Feb 29 17:45:43 <hangint3n>	So, I finally got my media server running. I've gotten it on a pi 4, Raspbian & Minidlna it has 2X 256MB USB sticks, one is for music, and the other is for movies & pictures. I presently just have the music populated, about 1900+ files. I'm slowly replacing my most important mucis with music from Qobuz.com. From there you can buy HiRes and beyond CD quality music in flac format. I'm super stoked
Feb 29 17:45:45 <hangint3n>	with the result.
Feb 29 17:46:05 <djph>	hangint3n: seems a bit undersized for 2024...
Feb 29 17:46:19 <ski>	bombastick : seems to be connected atm. .. also seems to've been banned in here, around one week and closer to five days ago (dunno the reason)
Feb 29 17:46:45 <djph>	hangint3n: where do you even find 256MB USB sticks these days?
Feb 29 17:47:23 <s1gyn>	In your desk drawer
Feb 29 17:47:42 <SFaulken>	djph: in my secret box of random obselete technology that lives out in the shed.
Feb 29 17:47:54 <hangint3n>	djph, ?   possible, but not right now
Feb 29 17:48:11 <hangint3n>	djph, amazon
Feb 29 17:49:06 <wigums>	i ran a file server on rpi4 for years but i used external drive docks for 3.5" hdd
Feb 29 17:49:49 <MinusOne>	Lol at the amazon descriptions for 256MB drives: 256MB, Not GB, Smaller than 1GB
Feb 29 17:50:20 <Inline>	eh, i'd not buy anything under 4T nowadays
Feb 29 17:50:40 <hangint3n>	you u can even get 2tb usbsticks
Feb 29 17:51:40 <Inline>	i have 2tb ssds
Feb 29 17:51:46 <Inline>	whished i had more
Feb 29 17:52:02 <Inline>	and more ram
Feb 29 17:52:10 <hangint3n>	sorry i see my mistake i meant 256Gb!
Feb 29 17:52:13 <Inline>	but lappy won't allow beyond 16G
Feb 29 17:52:25 <MinusOne>	I have 9tb of SSDs in my PC, never going back to hard drives unless I need massive RAID arrays
Feb 29 17:52:33 <Inline>	yeah, 256Gb epycs or so would be nice too....
Feb 29 17:52:37 <Inline>	lol
Feb 29 17:52:48 <djph>	damn, I didn't know they still made 256 *Mega* Byte USB sticks ... 5 for $10 sounds like a ripoff though
Feb 29 17:55:53 <hangint3n>	i bought the micro-sticks they are about 6mm long. perfect for a pi.
Feb 29 18:00:51 <djph>	Yeah, those little laptop-style ones are fun
Feb 29 18:03:03 <Aryan>	can we create a /usr/local/share/application ? for manually installation of /usr/share/application?
Feb 29 18:04:35 <espresso>	Aryan: I don't see why not.. https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_entries#Application_entry
Feb 29 18:06:51 <espresso>	I guess https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html was the official reference

Feb 29 18:33:05 <Aryan>	why install does that?
Feb 29 18:34:04 <Aryan>	-m, --mode=MODE
Feb 29 18:34:04 <Aryan>	set permission mode (as in chmod), instead of rwxr-xr-x
Feb 29 18:35:21 <Aryan>	So now I get it why they use always -m

Feb 29 18:40:02 <Helenah>	I'm trying to kill invesalius but it's not showing in my process list, it's as if it's left artifacts, like I can move the windows of it around.
Feb 29 18:41:07 <Helenah>	WTF?! It showed up as app.py?!
Feb 29 18:42:25 <suid_dumpable>	Helenah: maybe invesalius is a shell wrapper doing exec app.py once it did the setup
Feb 29 18:42:46 <wantyapps>	Helenah? Are you still here? :D
Feb 29 18:42:46 <louipc>	eww kill it!
Feb 29 18:44:21 <Helenah>	wantyapps: Yeah, why?
Feb 29 18:44:42 <wantyapps>	Helenah: I don't know... it's been a while and you are still on!
Feb 29 18:46:25 <Helenah>	Also I seem to only be able to rotate one way... https://invesalius.github.io/docs/user_guide/user_guide.html#rotate
Feb 29 18:46:45 <Helenah>	I mean... I don't want to rotate on that axis.
Feb 29 18:48:27 <Helenah>	wantyapps: Please stop joining and parting.
Feb 29 18:49:03 <wantyapps>	Helenah: Sorry about that, I was switching clients, between web-hosted thelounge and weechat on local
Feb 29 18:49:20 <node1>	Does anyone here use github for ci/cd pipeline for  aws ec2 instances?
Feb 29 18:52:26 <Helenah>	Like one image is of a posterior view so I click it and I get an medial view, and invesalious isn't allowing me to change it...
Feb 29 18:53:28 <jackal>	any suggestions for command line clipboard tool? xclip is great but looking for some w/o X
Feb 29 18:53:29 <Helenah>	I'm trying to look at the right sphenoid posterially.
Feb 29 18:57:14 <Helenah>	Figured it
Feb 29 18:57:29 <FlorianBad>	Is there a way to feed the current prompt from some STD* ?  For example:   grep my_long_command notes.txt > prompt     and BAM, I find myself in the shell prompt with that super long "my_long_command" that I can now modify and hit Enter
Feb 29 18:59:59 <kfrench>	FlorianBad: xclip?
Feb 29 19:00:39 <FlorianBad>	kfrench, in a real terminal ;)  (tty)
Feb 29 19:01:04 <xx>	FlorianBad: C-x C-e
Feb 29 19:01:08 <ski>	jackal : GNU Screen, or TMux
Feb 29 19:01:23 <ski>	FlorianBad : i think Screen can do that, with the `stuff' command ..
Feb 29 19:01:55 <suid_dumpable>	screen -X stuff "long command string"
Feb 29 19:03:16 <FlorianBad>	ok but you're opening a whole new shell then
Feb 29 19:03:45 <suid_dumpable>	FlorianBad: no, you run that command to inject it into a running screen session
Feb 29 19:03:54 <FlorianBad>	hmm
Feb 29 19:04:26 <xx>	or use vipe
Feb 29 19:04:42 <FlorianBad>	can it take some STDIN too?   So:  grep that notes.txt | screen -X stuff    ?
Feb 29 19:04:54 <xx>	FlorianBad: grep that notes.txt | vipe
Feb 29 19:05:58 <FlorianBad>	xx, ok I don't have vipe, seems like I will definitly need to try that thanks :)
Feb 29 19:06:24 <FlorianBad>	xx, so after that you find yourself with that line into the shell itself with your cursor next to it?
Feb 29 19:06:32 <xx>	if you want to then execute the command, you'd do `grep that notes.txt | vipe | sh -e -` for example
Feb 29 19:06:43 <xx>	FlorianBad: try it and see
Feb 29 19:06:58 <FlorianBad>	I don't want to execute
Feb 29 19:07:12 <xx>	then don't execute, just do `grep that notes.txt | vipe`
Feb 29 19:07:37 <FlorianBad>	ok, that sounds exactly like what I want. thanks
Feb 29 19:07:44 <xx>	certainly easier than having to learn all of screen
Feb 29 19:09:06 <Aryan>	Archlinux doesn't have vipe
Feb 29 19:09:54 <FlorianBad>	slackware either
Feb 29 19:10:16 <suid_dumpable>	on debian vipe is part of the moreutils package
Feb 29 19:11:00 <espresso>	there's vipe! https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/moreutils/files/
Feb 29 19:11:53 <Aryan>	yeah thanks again
Feb 29 19:12:06 <Aryan>	omg /usr/bin/pee
Feb 29 19:13:23 <suid_dumpable>	apt install toilet :)
Feb 29 19:14:25 <kurahaupo>	suid_dumpable: a friend got busted trying to break into an admin console, because it was sitting with a text editor instead of at a command prompt
Feb 29 19:14:51 <kurahaupo>	(This was pre-Linux)
Feb 29 19:15:53 <kfrench>	suid_dumpable: Username checks out.
Feb 29 19:16:15 <Aryan>	when I see the gnu stow last commit is 3yrs ago, i feel sad
Feb 29 19:17:29 <Aryan>	is that because people are not interested in it anymore or is it because it's in the most perfect version of itself?
Feb 29 19:17:36 <Helenah>	Damn
Feb 29 19:17:48 <Helenah>	Need more processing power! :(
Feb 29 19:18:07 <Aryan>	I mean do one thing and do it good, whatever.
Feb 29 19:18:41 <Aryan>	it does its job perfectly. no need to develop it...
Feb 29 19:19:23 <Helenah>	There comes a point with all software that... it either eventually gets abandoned or considered finished.
Feb 29 19:19:37 <Helenah>	And I can understand why a driver would eventually get considered finished.
Feb 29 19:21:13 <ananke>	that's a broad and false generalization. very small portion of software is ever considered 'finished'
Feb 29 19:25:51 <Aryan>	if the purpose is achieved I guess, it's finished. e.g. what else you want `ls` to do now? it does what it got to do...
Feb 29 19:27:39 <xx>	pee is fun but I always forget how to use it
Feb 29 19:28:15 <xx>	and typing `man pee` just feels wrong
Feb 29 19:29:13 <Khaytsus>	xx: Warms the heart
Feb 29 19:29:19 <Aryan>	sometimes when I'm lazy, I use `tldr` for fast remembering stuff
Feb 29 19:29:28 <dragonmaster>	and the pool
Feb 29 19:29:30 <kfrench>	eeeew
Feb 29 19:29:32 <xx>	heh
Feb 29 19:30:05 *	Aryan changes IRC background to yellow.
Feb 29 19:30:21 <dragonmaster>	time to hydrate
Feb 29 19:33:33 <Aryan>	omg I searched 'man pee' expecting showing the manpage, google brought a man peeing on grass
Feb 29 19:33:59 <dragonmaster>	enjoy your new algorithmically suggested images
Feb 29 19:34:25 <kfrench>	Aryan: So, you're new to the internet?
Feb 29 19:35:49 <xx>	there are worse `man ...` you could search for and get an unexpected image
Feb 29 19:36:00 <Manbr>	Hi
Feb 29 19:36:06 <jsmith326>	hi people
Feb 29 19:36:10 <Manbr>	Can anyone help me connect to the irc server irc.brazink.net with Weechat?
Feb 29 19:36:26 <xx>	Manbr: did you read the weechat user guide?
Feb 29 19:36:31 <Aryan>	kfrench, no, why?
Feb 29 19:36:44 <kfrench>	Aryan: Seems like a rookie mistake
Feb 29 19:36:56 <nasmConnoisseur>	Hello
Feb 29 19:37:21 <Manbr>	xx Yes, but I can't resolve an SSL certificate error
Feb 29 19:37:59 <Aryan>	well, I prefer internet manual pages than mine on terminal, it's easier. kfrench, how'd you prevent that mistake then?
Feb 29 19:38:16 <kfrench>	Probably adding Linux to the search terms
Feb 29 19:38:22 <xx>	Manbr: error on the server, their certificate is expired
Feb 29 19:39:23 <Aryan>	yeah that's another way
Feb 29 19:39:28 <Manbr>	xx So there is no way to connect with an IRC client?
Feb 29 19:40:21 <xx>	Manbr: there is, you just have to make weechat ignore the error
Feb 29 19:40:40 <xx>	ideally the server would get fixed though
Feb 29 19:41:06 <Manbr>	xx Ok, I am going to try. Thank you very much!
Feb 29 19:41:08 <BrokenCog>	wc
Feb 29 19:55:13 <zeratul>	when using rsync how to I copy an entire folder instead just the content of a folder?
Feb 29 19:55:28 <zeratul>	*instead of
Feb 29 19:56:06 <c512l>	```
Feb 29 19:56:39 <SponiX>	If only that was documented somewhere
Feb 29 19:56:56 <neachdainn>	Purely for education/curiosity: `dlopen` binds the shared object to a virtual address space, not to a process, correct?
Feb 29 19:57:17 <xx>	zeratul: don't use / at the end of the directory
Feb 29 19:57:21 <uwharrie>	zeratul: see the portion of the man page discussing trailing `/` characters to figure out exactly which behaviour you want
Feb 29 19:57:41 <neachdainn>	That is, two processes that share a VAS will both have access to a shared object that only one of the processes `dlopen`d, right?
Feb 29 19:57:52 <zeratul>	xx, that did it :D
Feb 29 19:58:02 <xx>	beware of tab complete
Feb 29 19:58:29 <zeratul>	lol
Feb 29 19:58:37 <zeratul>	so true
Feb 29 20:06:22 <kurahaupo>	neachdainn: in general threads (processes that share a single virtual address space) share everything, but on Linux that can be fine tuned.
Feb 29 20:07:17 <neachdainn>	I don't mean threads, I mean processes that share VAS (i.e., `CLONE_VM`).
Feb 29 20:08:22 <neachdainn>	The fact that they share memory mappings make me relatively confident they'll also share `dlopen`d objects but those aren't called out specifically
Feb 29 20:08:30 <kurahaupo>	Well, that's the mechanism by which threads share their address space, but true, there are other things that are also shared by threads (signal handlers, file descriptors, etc)
Feb 29 20:09:44 <kurahaupo>	It's also possible for threads to only partially share their address space, but that has to be set up explicitly
Feb 29 20:10:44 <neachdainn>	I'm playing around to see if I can get multiple embedded Python interpreters in a single process and I managed to get that working with `dlmopen` but Glibc limits me to no more than 16 interpreters using that method.
Feb 29 20:10:49 <kurahaupo>	dlopen is a library call that sits on top of mmap, and then runs around fixing up address references
Feb 29 20:11:20 <neachdainn>	So now I'm seeing if I can get around that limitation by having multiple processes in the same VAS and loading more than 16 interpreters
Feb 29 20:11:39 <velix>	I don't get it. How can something as incomplete as bcachefs get into the kernel? Seems like it's some personal preference of the kernel owner?
Feb 29 20:11:41 <kurahaupo>	What gives rise to that limit?
Feb 29 20:12:43 <neachdainn>	`man 2 dlmopen`: "The glibc implementation supports a maximum of 16 namespaces."
Feb 29 20:12:51 <xx>	velix: kernel is full of incomplete stuff
Feb 29 20:12:55 <xx>	you were warned that bcachefs is not ready yet
Feb 29 20:13:31 <kurahaupo>	velix: incomplete? Does it need any more for its original purpose?
Feb 29 20:13:44 <velix>	xx: sure, I just was wondering, why someone integrates it.
Feb 29 20:14:02 <velix>	kurahaupo: oh, then it's complete?
Feb 29 20:14:23 <kurahaupo>	I'm not saying that, I'm asking what would you add to it?
Feb 29 20:14:53 <velix>	kurahaupo: they have a loooong roadmap and planned features on their own with stuff, which is fundamental to other modern fs.
Feb 29 20:15:00 <velix>	like scrubbing for example.
Feb 29 20:16:19 <kurahaupo>	I thought bcachefs was a fairly niche fs only intended to support limited operations, but maybe the devs have decided to fill it out into something more general purpose
Feb 29 20:16:38 <dostoyevsky2>	I wonder how I could compile binaries that run on ubuntu touch... so for arm64...  I guess I could run a arm64 based linux in qemu?
Feb 29 20:16:58 <velix>	kurahaupo: niche fs seem to have undetected bugs because only some users use them, not the mass.
Feb 29 20:17:10 <velix>	niche software in general ;)
Feb 29 20:17:16 <kurahaupo>	True that
Feb 29 20:17:37 <velix>	and since scrubbing isn't supported, you won't even get to know about it :DDD
Feb 29 20:37:21 <neachdainn>	Well, I'm getting all sorts of segfaults trying out `CLONE_VM` + `dlopen`, so I'm going to take that to mean it's an address space thing and not a process thing.
Feb 29 20:40:10 <wantyapps>	mlu: Are you back?
Feb 29 20:45:07 <wantyapps>	Does anyone know if weechat has mouse control?
Feb 29 20:46:53 <SFaulken>	for some values of "mouse control" yes.
Feb 29 20:47:15 <wantyapps>	For example, does it have buffer navigation via mouse?
Feb 29 20:47:19 <SFaulken>	yes
Feb 29 20:47:23 <wantyapps>	Just asking, I don't actually have a mouse
Feb 29 20:47:28 <wantyapps>	tty be like :D
Feb 29 20:47:36 <wantyapps>	thanks SFaulken
Feb 29 20:49:14 <dostoyevsky2>	you can also replace the keyboard and just wheel them in on your mouse
Feb 29 20:49:28 <wantyapps>	dostoyevsky2: Wheel what in?
Feb 29 20:49:38 <dostoyevsky2>	the letters
Feb 29 20:49:43 <wantyapps>	Got it.
Feb 29 20:50:05 <wantyapps>	I just usually use my instance of thelounge on my site, only recently returned to tty irc
Feb 29 20:50:41 <dostoyevsky2>	https://www.goodfreephotos.com/albums/other-photos/old-style-classic-telephone.jpg <- things used to be so much more intuitive back in the days
Feb 29 20:51:08 <wantyapps>	dostoyevsky2: Hehe
Feb 29 20:53:02 <wantyapps>	SFaulken: since you know about WeeChat, do you know if I can move buffers around? (Replace buf 1 with 2, for example)
Feb 29 20:53:22 <Khaytsus>	wantyapps: https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html
Feb 29 20:53:32 <SFaulken>	yes.
Feb 29 20:53:34 <wantyapps>	Khaytsus: Thanks!
Feb 29 20:53:52 <Khaytsus>	Look for /buffer, first reference is a link to the buffer section
Feb 29 20:53:57 <Khaytsus>	Or /help buffer
Feb 29 20:54:25 <Khaytsus>	Weechat guide is excellent, biggest issue for me is generally what does weechat call a thing ;)
Feb 29 20:54:27 <wantyapps>	thanks Khaytsus! Y'all are really good at this
Feb 29 20:55:15 <Sparkles>	wantyapps, it supports not just mose click events but also gestures like click, move, and release!
Feb 29 20:55:25 <wantyapps>	HUH
Feb 29 20:57:02 <Khaytsus>	It does have a mouse mode, no idea what it can do though...  heh
Feb 29 20:57:38 <Artfaith>	The author and Community of Weechat is very welcome and supportive also. #weechat on Libera if you ever have questions about the brilliant project, wantyapps.
Feb 29 20:57:57 <wantyapps>	Artfaith: will join, didn't expect so many good answers!
Feb 29 20:58:29 <Artfaith>	Khaytsus, scroll buffer history and bars like nicklick via wheel for example.
Feb 29 20:59:06 <Artfaith>	nicklist*

Mar 01 01:59:40 *	Topic for #linux set by Khaytsus (Thu Aug  3 13:54:32 2023)
Mar 01 02:00:15 <wigums>	i dont know... i mean if you have a file you cant do anything with id think it rather important to learn why
Mar 01 02:02:44 <phogg>	Anyone know why apache tries to make an outbound connection with 443 as the source port when doing a ProxyPass over https? Or how to make it use a regular high port instead? It's surprisingly hard to google for.
Mar 01 02:03:18 <Disconsented>	"high port"?
Mar 01 02:03:37 <wigums>	above 1024
Mar 01 02:03:40 <Disconsented>	Ah
Mar 01 02:03:47 <Khaytsus>	I wonder if it does that to avoid having to create more firewall holes
Mar 01 02:03:49 <daniie>	above 1023 ;)
Mar 01 02:04:07 <Disconsented>	In theory you just specify the port in the URL
Mar 01 02:04:24 <Disconsented>	https://127.0.0.1:8080
Mar 01 02:04:47 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 01 02:04:48 *	litharge removes ban on *!~gargantua@2604:3d09:8c7c:7e30::8b5f
Mar 01 02:04:48 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 01 02:04:57 <Disconsented>	But I wouldn't expect to proxy over HTTPS
Mar 01 02:05:22 <phogg>	Khaytsus: and yet this is causing me to need to add more firewall rules
Mar 01 02:05:36 <Khaytsus>	phogg: huh..  yhou don't allow 443 outgoing?
Mar 01 02:06:10 <phogg>	Disconsented: I am proxying over https because the connection goes over the net, it's not to a local internal system or another process on the same box. Seems safer, even though it's unusual
Mar 01 02:06:21 <phogg>	apache did not support it well until the 2.4.40s era
Mar 01 02:06:30 <Disconsented>	Yeah okay fair
Mar 01 02:06:36 <Disconsented>	I'd have used a VPN instead however
Mar 01 02:06:46 <phogg>	Khaytsus: I denied all outbound and then added on a whitelist only expected connections, e.g. dport 443
Mar 01 02:07:01 <phogg>	Khaytsus: but then apache is doing sport 443 and dport of a high port.
Mar 01 02:07:33 <phogg>	Disconsented: doesn't make sense when the target system is also facing the net and can respond directly.
Mar 01 02:07:37 <Inline>	443 is for stuff needing tls
Mar 01 02:07:52 <phogg>	Inline: aka everything
Mar 01 02:08:05 <Disconsented>	Then why proxy it to begin with
Mar 01 02:08:24 <phogg>	Disconsented: most connections go through the proxy, some go directly.
Mar 01 02:08:25 <Disconsented>	Otherwise I disagree, a VPN provides you a stronger set of guarantees and less firewall rules
Mar 01 02:08:55 <Disconsented>	But also, (beyond already answering the original question) we're working with about 0 information as to what you're doing service/network wise
Mar 01 02:09:10 <phogg>	Disconsented: I can't VPN the backing boxes because they are front-facing systems. They also provide responses that another front-facing system needs and doesn't need to duplicate.
Mar 01 02:09:14 <phogg>	anything else duplicates effortt
Mar 01 02:09:48 <phogg>	Disconsented: I will tell you anything you want (from memory, the actual config is at work and I'm at home at the moment)
Mar 01 02:10:01 <Disconsented>	A diagram would be useful for me
Mar 01 02:10:21 <phogg>	Disconsented: diagram of what exactly?
Mar 01 02:10:53 <Disconsented>	Please dont ping me every line; A diagram of the services in question and how their networks are interconnected
Mar 01 02:10:59 <phogg>	network connections come into the apache box, it connects out to one of several other hosts also running web servers.
Mar 01 02:11:41 <phogg>	Disconsented: Speaking to you is how replies are indicated on IRC. Sorry (not sorry). There is no network interconnecting involved here, it's irrelevant. The systems can communicate OK.
Mar 01 02:12:10 <Disconsented>	And yet you can tell I am replying to you, without needing to ping you.
Mar 01 02:12:19 <phogg>	if I don't have the outbound connection filter in my iptables everything works as expected. The only weird thing is apache using 443 as a *source* port
Mar 01 02:12:52 <phogg>	Disconsented: I can infer it, but it's not more correct--it's less.
Mar 01 02:13:18 <Disconsented>	Its not any less correct, its a conversation.
Mar 01 02:14:03 <Disconsented>	Either way, I find your response dismissive and given your response to requesting information I've lost interest.
Mar 01 02:14:03 <phogg>	You clearly think there is some problem with this, but it's IRC. I am not changing how IRC works for you, or my habits.
Mar 01 02:14:21 <phogg>	Again, happy to provide any details you want.
Mar 01 02:14:44 <phogg>	Network connection information is, however, irrelevant. If you can explain how it might help to know it then that would be interesting
Mar 01 02:15:04 <phogg>	If this were a network diagram I would have host A, then an arrow to a cloud, then an arrow to host B. Both are directly connected to the internet.
Mar 01 02:16:04 <phogg>	probably need a more apache-specific forum
Mar 01 02:16:06 <AndyCap>	or you're confusing the incoming and resulting proxy http connections when looking at it.
Mar 01 02:16:42 <phogg>	AndyCap: I'd like to think so, but I am seeing a deny in my OUTPUT chain.
Mar 01 02:17:11 <phogg>	AndyCap: would a connect back from the proxy'd backing machine look like a packet in OUTPUT with that box as the source port?
Mar 01 02:17:20 *	phogg doesn't remember if he checked the IPs involved
Mar 01 02:17:55 <phogg>	Still, it's a good idea. I'll have to double check that.
Mar 01 02:19:30 <NeXeN>	phogg: what happened?
Mar 01 02:19:44 <phogg>	NeXeN: with what?
Mar 01 02:20:04 <NeXeN>	needing more apache-specific forum?
Mar 01 02:20:52 <phogg>	NeXeN: I am asking questions here which might require some rather specific apache experience to answer.
Mar 01 02:21:46 <phogg>	if no one happens to have been in my exact shoes before then I need more serious expertice. That or try to follow along with the source code.
Mar 01 02:21:56 <NeXeN>	nice to see someone using good ol' apache
Mar 01 02:22:23 <phogg>	nginx is pretty nice, but the advantage to apache is that I've been using it for decades and have most of the config memorized
Mar 01 02:22:33 <phogg>	can't beat the convenience of "I *already* know how to do that"
Mar 01 02:22:40 <wigums>	^^
Mar 01 02:22:58 <NeXeN>	what's it doing?
Mar 01 02:23:04 <phogg>	the big down side is apache is enormous and has tons of things that are irrelevant to borderline harmful to most users
Mar 01 02:24:06 <phogg>	pro tip, do NOT load distro apache config as-is. Always comment out loadmodule lines you do not *require*
Mar 01 02:24:32 <phogg>	NeXeN: nothing special, just serving up a web app
Mar 01 02:26:24 <rascul>	i always start with new config for apache or nginx
Mar 01 02:26:27 <rascul>	not distro config
Mar 01 02:26:37 <phogg>	wise move
Mar 01 02:26:44 <rascul>	well, i have configs for both that i reuse that i started from scratch
Mar 01 02:27:17 <rascul>	this way i know exactly what the config is and i don't have to guess about what distro does or doesn't do what
Mar 01 02:27:21 <n4dir>	where else would you start?
Mar 01 02:27:29 <rascul>	could start with the distro config
Mar 01 02:27:37 <n4dir>	got you, thanks
Mar 01 02:28:27 <phogg>	distro apache config is a lot like distro kernel config, only more generic, easier to change without breaking things, and more security down sides if you don't change it
Mar 01 02:28:32 <rascul>	if you're not good at figuring out an apache or nginx config though then starting with distro config probably wouldn't hurt much
Mar 01 02:29:12 <phogg>	it's nice in that it will work, it's just going to expose more surface area than you need
Mar 01 02:29:24 <rascul>	yeah
Mar 01 02:29:36 <rascul>	and sometimes the distro configs can vary widely
Mar 01 02:29:49 <rascul>	so care must be taken when going from one distro to the next
Mar 01 02:43:24 <Your_Dog>	is it just me or is the gnu linux graphical stack not designed to have a busy OS disk in mind? I mean if the OS disk becomes busy, X11 or wayland wise,  the whole DE gets unresponsive until its over
Mar 01 02:43:45 <Elw3>	yes
Mar 01 02:43:51 <hodapp>	on a modern machine that is a *lot* of I/O
Mar 01 02:43:55 <phogg>	Your_Dog: Welcome to Linux. There are some ways to help work around that. Some people swear by using a different scheduler.
Mar 01 02:44:16 <Khaytsus>	Some people use SSDs
Mar 01 02:44:27 <Your_Dog>	phogg enlighten me with these work arounds lol, also i am using an ssd
Mar 01 02:44:29 <Elw3>	Ideally you have an  os and a data disk so that never happens
Mar 01 02:44:43 <Khaytsus>	You sure it's IO that's the issue then?
Mar 01 02:44:57 <NeXeN>	on the upside, there's a bazillion ways to configure your system out of that type of mess
Mar 01 02:45:09 <Your_Dog>	Khaytsus: pretty sure because I let steam update a game installed on an OS disk and well after its done downloading, it became unresponsive for a bit
Mar 01 02:45:16 <phogg>	Your_Dog: making xorg less nice can help some. Try renicing it to a value < 0 but above the nice value for kernel threads
Mar 01 02:45:39 <phogg>	ssd only makes IO stalls go faster, it doesn't make them happen less
Mar 01 02:46:06 <Your_Dog>	interesting
Mar 01 02:46:08 <Your_Dog>	i should try that
Mar 01 02:46:13 <phogg>	process nice feeds ionice defaults. You could also just ionice for much the same impact
Mar 01 02:46:13 <espresso>	I don't think I really noticed such problems even with slow IO, but maybe if Steam was crunching CPU
Mar 01 02:47:22 <Your_Dog>	espresso: try downloading an update on a large game where the download patch is small then wait where its "processing" the downloaded update
Mar 01 02:47:31 <Disconsented>	Steam does need to decompress files
Mar 01 02:47:38 <espresso>	Your_Dog: that's what I think I mean by crunching CPU
Mar 01 02:48:24 <Your_Dog>	hmmh, i dont think the CPU was that busy, or i didnt bother checking because it was unresponsive I just let it do what it needed to do
Mar 01 02:51:04 <phogg>	you have always been able to make X stutter on Linux if you saturate disk I/O. This has been discussed ad nauseum. Alternate schedulers that attempt to fix this have been tried over the years. Some people swear they make night-and-day difference, others say there's no measureable difference.
Mar 01 02:52:14 <Your_Dog>	yeah X stuttering is a bit known already but I didnt expect wayland to be there too. Could be also a KDE plasma 5 bug
Mar 01 02:52:40 <phogg>	I've not personally seen it on wayland, but I don't see any reason it should be different
Mar 01 02:53:22 <buraq>	Your_Dog: x is not stuttering. what do you mean?
Mar 01 02:53:41 <Your_Dog>	phogg just said! smh
Mar 01 03:11:22 <buraq>	using bfq with a hdd might cause that
Mar 01 03:14:53 <buraq>	copying large files on usb storage has always been problematic (gets really slow) but i haven't seen the ui stutter because of that
Mar 01 03:55:12 *	rascul shakes his linux
Mar 01 03:56:30 <rbox>	shake your money maker
Mar 01 03:59:09 *	kfrench shakes an empty cup at #linux.
Mar 01 04:00:07 <rbox>	spare some change....
Mar 01 04:00:54 *	rascul fills kfrench's cup with beer
Mar 01 04:01:00 <kfrench>	score!
Mar 01 04:39:50 <Anjor>	huh
Mar 01 04:40:03 <westcoastguy>	?
Mar 01 04:40:26 <Anjor>	Very slow night.
Mar 01 04:40:29 <westcoastguy>	ye
Mar 01 04:40:33 <westcoastguy>	nothing at all
Mar 01 04:40:45 <westcoastguy>	but  i'm spending all my time on #hamradio lol
Mar 01 04:40:52 <westcoastguy>	just waiting for some activity here
Mar 01 04:41:00 <TrippleZeta>	wait same
Mar 01 04:41:14 <TrippleZeta>	we all just lurking? lmao
Mar 01 04:41:20 <westcoastguy>	probably
Mar 01 04:43:06 <westcoastguy>	lol my irssi window is all joins and leaves
Mar 01 04:43:48 <Anjor>	An eerie lack of activity across many channels.  I'm wondering is something isn't... regular.
Mar 01 04:44:00 <Anjor>	s/is/if
Mar 01 04:45:09 <kfrench>	Maybe the bots couldn't handle leap day
Mar 01 04:45:21 <westcoastguy>	yea
Mar 01 04:45:33 <Anjor>	It would have been my grandfather's 25th birthday today.
Mar 01 04:45:41 <westcoastguy>	#hamradio is quiet too
Mar 01 04:46:15 <ssm_>	Anjor: The Rending has Begun
Mar 01 04:47:42 <Anjor>	Maybe we finally fixed all the bugs.
Mar 01 04:47:47 <Anjor>	Yeah, that's gotta be it.
Mar 01 04:47:53 <Anjor>	We won.
Mar 01 04:48:03 <Anjor>	We won at computers.
Mar 01 04:53:14 <kfrench>	Does that mean I have to go outside tomorrow?
Mar 01 04:54:48 <Anjor>	But being inside is being outside of outside. It's technically outside.
Mar 01 04:54:58 <Anjor>	inside = outside
Mar 01 04:58:30 <pankaj>	I am experimenting with '/etc/issue' file for custom login prompt on virtual console. How can I manually refresh the login prompt so I can see the changes on fly without restarting my system.
Mar 01 04:59:17 <rbox>	kill the getty
Mar 01 04:59:38 <kfrench>	rbox: So violent
Mar 01 04:59:49 <rbox>	i didnt' say kill dash nine...
Mar 01 05:00:48 <superkuh>	Awww shit, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rG74rG_ubs Kill -9 - Monzy | Linux Rap
Mar 01 05:02:01 <pankaj>	rbox: Done
Mar 01 05:27:02 <fuwu>	can you dd an img.xz file onto a usb as an install medium?
Mar 01 05:27:18 <fuwu>	or should you extract the .img file before dd-ing?
Mar 01 05:28:41 <qman>	you need to extract it, but it can be done in one step with a one-liner
Mar 01 05:30:38 <fuwu>	how?  i'm a nub with cli
Mar 01 05:38:46 <MinusOne>	fuwu: do you know about pipes?
Mar 01 05:40:01 <jb1277976>	if plasma lets you raise the volume past the normal limit will any window manager do that or is it just plasma ?
Mar 01 05:40:07 <MinusOne>	fuwu, I'll help you do it, but only on the condition that I explain how it works and you learn :)
Mar 01 05:41:12 <MinusOne>	jb1277976: I know you can do it in pavucontrol. It isn't tied specifically to a wm, though a particular wm may offer at as a GUI feature
Mar 01 05:41:23 <espresso>	fuwu: also, linuxjourney.com/ not a bad place to learn linux
Mar 01 05:44:35 <rascul>	fuwu if img.xz is a filesystem or disk image, and it's bootable, then you can do it
Mar 01 05:44:45 <rascul>	or a hybrid iso
Mar 01 05:45:14 <rascul>	or if what you extract is one of those things then you can do it with what it extracts to
Mar 01 05:45:38 <uprayedd>	wat
Mar 01 05:45:59 <MinusOne>	I mean he's not wrong, he's just extremely confusing
Mar 01 05:46:35 <rascul>	what's confusing?
Mar 01 05:46:52 <MinusOne>	lol just the phrasing of your last sentence rascul
Mar 01 05:46:53 <fuwu>	MinusOne, not really, i've seen commands with pipes and asked about it before, but i forget
Mar 01 05:47:06 <rascul>	what phrasing is confusing? i can try to use different words
Mar 01 05:47:38 <fuwu>	espresso, i'll check that out, thanks
Mar 01 05:47:44 <MinusOne>	fuwu, everything on the command line has an output, and most require input. You can use the output of one command as the input to another. The tool used to do that is called a pipe
Mar 01 05:48:05 <rascul>	pipes are for smoking and passing data
Mar 01 05:48:12 <MinusOne>	well pretty much everything has an output =P. You could do: echo test | cat
Mar 01 05:48:20 <rascul>	and also transferring fluids and sometimes gasses
Mar 01 05:48:44 <rascul>	not everything has an output on success though
Mar 01 05:49:02 <MinusOne>	that pipes the output of echo to cat. In this case you need to extract a file and write it, so you will use your decompression program piped to dd, which will output to the location you are writing
Mar 01 05:49:06 <loganlee>	MinusOne, $ cat <(echo test)
Mar 01 05:49:08 <rascul>	but exit value should be 0 if it succeeds
Mar 01 05:49:58 <MinusOne>	fuwu: did that make sense? You can try to construct your command line with that knowledge
Mar 01 05:52:19 <rascul>	i like big mutts
Mar 01 05:54:19 <MinusOne>	time for me to eat, fuwu, but I guarantee plenty of people here can help you. Play around with pipes and put your command in chat when you think you have it, if you want verification =P
Mar 01 05:54:58 <rascul>	xzcat img.xz >/dev/saf
Mar 01 05:55:56 <rascul>	if want progress:   xzcat img.xz | pv >/dev/saf
Mar 01 05:57:41 <r-zan>	Hello everyone
Mar 01 05:58:15 <rascul>	who are you calling an everyone?
Mar 01 05:59:50 *	SFaulken calls rascul everyone

Mar 01 06:01:00 *	rascul gives SFaulken everyone's beer
Mar 01 06:01:09 <SFaulken>	woo!
Mar 01 06:01:17 <loganlee>	woooooo!
Mar 01 06:01:20 <rascul>	just this round though
Mar 01 06:01:26 <n4dir>	no one thinks about everybody, it seems
Mar 01 06:01:28 <rascul>	i have all the beers for all rounds ready to go
Mar 01 06:01:45 <westcoastguy>	lol
Mar 01 06:01:46 <rascul>	westcoastguy is helping
Mar 01 06:02:08 <westcoastguy>	>:)
Mar 01 06:02:28 *	rascul passes out more beer
Mar 01 06:02:57 <rascul>	i just want to make an announcement
Mar 01 06:03:06 <rascul>	you can't drink all day if you don't start early
Mar 01 06:03:15 <westcoastguy>	lol
Mar 01 06:03:17 <Anjor>	Tubi seems to have rebranded their logos and colours.  Huh. Neat.
Mar 01 06:03:19 <Guest2>	ahá
Mar 01 06:03:20 *	SFaulken nods sagaciously
Mar 01 06:03:25 <n4dir>	but it is late for you already
Mar 01 06:03:35 <rascul>	not too late for tomorrow
Mar 01 06:03:41 <Guest2>	kkk
Mar 01 06:03:50 <rascul>	no kkk please
Mar 01 06:03:50 <n4dir>	perhaps after midnight in a few, i guess that counts as early for saturday drinking
Mar 01 06:04:31 <n4dir>	just keep drinking. sooner or later you have early and too late fixed.
Mar 01 06:05:37 <buraq>	   
Mar 01 06:06:32 <n4dir>	sagacious doesn't sound like a word
Mar 01 06:06:56 <louipc>	it about carl sagan
Mar 01 06:07:02 <SFaulken>	n4dir doesn't sound like a word.
Mar 01 06:07:25 <n4dir>	i will replace saga-dingens with nadir-dingens
Mar 01 06:07:32 <n4dir>	at least i know how to write it
Mar 01 06:07:42 *	mlu stares at the anti-zenith
Mar 01 06:08:06 <Anjor>	What did you just call me ?
Mar 01 06:08:07 <buraq>	         
Mar 01 06:08:13 <n4dir>	similar: shrewd. As if that would help
Mar 01 06:08:29 <rascul>	it helps someone shrewd like me
Mar 01 06:08:31 <n4dir>	i got a feeling they just make up new words
Mar 01 06:08:40 <fuwu>	rascul, lmao
Mar 01 06:08:43 <SFaulken>	unpossible.
Mar 01 06:08:46 <rascul>	wait am i even shrewd?
Mar 01 06:08:51 <Anjor>	They get splendierfous with their wordsmithing.
Mar 01 06:09:05 <SFaulken>	rascul: you're confusing shrewd with lewd again.
Mar 01 06:09:12 <rascul>	oh, yeah
Mar 01 06:09:18 <rascul>	sorry
Mar 01 06:09:21 <Anjor>	splendiferous*
Mar 01 06:09:35 <rascul>	i'm very splendiferous
Mar 01 06:09:40 <rascul>	whatever that means
Mar 01 06:10:53 <Anjor>	From Medieval Latin splendiferus, from Late Latin splendōrifer, from Latin splendor + -fer (“bearing”), reintroduced humorously into English c. 1837.

Mar 01 06:10:59 <rascul>	right now i'm just eating salad and drinking beer and watching a movie
Mar 01 06:11:23 <SFaulken>	rascul: is it at least a meat salad?
Mar 01 06:11:24 <pankaj>	I am modifying my current .Xresources file. Is their any command or how do I check the list of name, class and resources available that I can modify??
Mar 01 06:11:30 <loganlee>	rascul, on repeat?
Mar 01 06:11:32 <rascul>	it has some chicken

Mar 01 06:11:49 <loganlee>	rascul, lol
Mar 01 06:12:31 <n4dir>	pankaj: i'd bet the arch wiki. But i would have also bet there is a manpage, and i seem to have been wrong
Mar 01 06:12:38 <fuwu>	MinusOne, yeah it does.  what's the command to extract a .img.xz file?  and if i want to pipe the output of the previous command to a certain section of the following command, example: pipe output to x, in "sudo dd if=x of=/dev/sdx bs=4M", how do i do so?
Mar 01 06:12:52 <fuwu>	sagacious is close enough to sagely imo
Mar 01 06:12:59 <fuwu>	i think
Mar 01 06:14:10 <n4dir>	also close to savage, if that is a word
Mar 01 06:15:09 <SFaulken>	huh, that was odd.
Mar 01 06:15:49 <rascul>	xzcat img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdx bs=4M status=progress
Mar 01 06:15:49 <n4dir>	fuwu: you want the previous command to be a command before dd?
Mar 01 06:16:09 <pankaj>	n4dir: I am going through same arch_wiki however very little help from there.
Mar 01 06:16:19 <n4dir>	pankaj: ah, damnit. sorry
Mar 01 06:16:37 <n4dir>	it is the main reason i gave up on xterm. Never much fun finding the info
Mar 01 06:18:13 <rascul>	it's in xterm man page
Mar 01 06:18:14 <rbox>	never give up
Mar 01 06:18:17 <rbox>	NEVER SURRENDER
Mar 01 06:18:29 <rascul>	i only surrender to zorry

Mar 01 06:19:12 <n4dir>	i probably wouldn't fiddle with extracting and dd'in in one line. Seems easy enough to screw it
Mar 01 06:19:27 <rascul>	can't screw it up if you don't screw it up
Mar 01 06:19:35 <n4dir>	but then: am also the guy who gave up on xterm too early ...
Mar 01 06:20:04 <rascul>	one line is just two lines in one
Mar 01 06:20:04 <SFaulken>	I still keep my .Xresources around, even though I havent actually used urxvt in years.
Mar 01 06:20:36 <n4dir>	is it one line too?
Mar 01 06:21:00 <jimmy>	pfioajew
Mar 01 06:22:20 <SFaulken>	the best linux is done on one line.
Mar 01 06:22:27 <rascul>	n4dir i'll stand in one line with you
Mar 01 06:22:43 <n4dir>	we will avoid the frontline. It can get messy there
Mar 01 06:22:55 <rascul>	just don't avoid the beer
Mar 01 06:23:15 <n4dir>	yup, somewhere cosy, having beer and giving good advice for the other lines
Mar 01 06:23:33 <rascul>	good?
Mar 01 06:23:51 <rascul>	seems subjective
Mar 01 06:24:24 <n4dir>	they won't listen anyway. As long we thing it is good, it is good

Mar 01 06:25:37 <preach>	rbox: galaxy quest!
Mar 01 06:34:35 <Spring>	Is there any way to abort a captive `smartctl` scan? Read that the docs say only non-captive tests can be aborted but unclear how one would deal with a scenario where a UPS client requested immediate shutdown.
Mar 01 06:34:57 <rbox>	cry?
Mar 01 06:38:05 <lockywolf>	wow, programs written in pure X11 eat so little memory
Mar 01 06:38:53 <lockywolf>	Spring: I think "captive" tests are basically lossy
Mar 01 06:39:00 <lockywolf>	that is if you don't care much about the data
Mar 01 06:39:17 <lockywolf>	if you end up running one, immediate shutdown should be fine
Mar 01 06:39:31 <lockywolf>	without any additional movements
Mar 01 06:39:36 <hackinghorn>	hi
Mar 01 06:39:56 <Spring>	Mind explaining the lossy aspect? My understanding is captive just takes exclusive control of the drive, while non-captive allows interruption by other programs.
Mar 01 06:40:19 <hackinghorn>	how do I disable docker cache for specific RUN commands? Not all. I found this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35134713/disable-cache-for-specific-run-commands . But I want to keep the same command each run?
Mar 01 06:40:40 <hackinghorn>	eh, I guess no way
Mar 01 06:42:29 <rbox>	whats the command
Mar 01 06:42:34 <lockywolf>	Spring: you are right. Lossy in the sense that if you end up doing a captive test, things are probably bad enough that this disk is not working anyway
Mar 01 06:43:22 <hackinghorn>	ah, I found out, just make a script and put it in CMD or ENTRYPOINT, it makes sure it gets run
Mar 01 06:44:19 <rbox>	well t hat has ntohing to do with building
Mar 01 06:45:07 <hackinghorn>	thats true, maybe I dont need to!
Mar 01 07:21:04 <Artfaith>	hackinghorn, you could have an ARG there just before the command and set it to random value like the current time or version of the build whenever required.
Mar 01 07:22:06 <Artfaith>	ARGs exist only at build times just in case. Those are not ENV ones.
Mar 01 07:22:17 *	mlu has an argument

Mar 01 08:26:43 <Artfaith>	It depend on the distribution also. I would check `man logrotate` then since it may be default or custom depending on it.
Mar 01 08:27:01 <Artfaith>	depends*
Mar 01 08:27:02 <loganlee>	eawfaw, permission issue maybe?
Mar 01 08:29:58 <Artfaith>	eawfaw, if nothing helps determining the issue, I would strace the server's executable.
Mar 01 08:30:18 <lopid>	/var/log/*.log
Mar 01 08:30:27 <Artfaith>	In order to debug when the moment when the error gets logged.
Mar 01 08:30:29 <steering>	eqw: I have a dmesg.service on Ubuntu which rotates it with `savelog`
Mar 01 08:30:56 <eoli3n>	tell me, why is the f***** PATH var hardcoded for cron

Mar 01 08:32:37 <Artfaith>	Well, PATH has defaults in the most shells too.
Mar 01 08:33:27 <eoli3n>	maybe something is wrong at my side, but when i run a script with a sheband (/bin/bash) as root, why do cron fails with command not found for /usr/local/bin/*
Mar 01 08:33:34 <eoli3n>	shebang*
Mar 01 08:34:05 <eoli3n>	i guess becauss it is not interactive, and then it doesn't load .bashrc or something
Mar 01 08:34:06 <Artfaith>	Most likely your PATH is being set in custom profile/rc files like .bashrc.
Mar 01 08:34:11 <eoli3n>	right
Mar 01 08:34:17 <Artfaith>	The default BASH one is set inside Bash.
Mar 01 08:34:36 <eoli3n>	then what is the right way to solve my problem ?
Mar 01 08:34:42 <eoli3n>	should i set PATH in crontab ?
Mar 01 08:34:46 <eoli3n>	or in my script ?
Mar 01 08:34:58 <eoli3n>	should i bash -c in the cron line ?
Mar 01 08:35:01 <Artfaith>	I would use full paths or set PATH inside script.
Mar 01 08:35:17 <eoli3n>	let's set the path inside the script
Mar 01 08:35:19 <eoli3n>	thanks
Mar 01 08:35:26 <steering>	eoli3n: you can replace it with cronie and make sure that cronie is started with the -P option
Mar 01 08:35:40 <steering>	but that won't help if you're setting it in bashrc or similar anyway.
Mar 01 08:36:34 <Artfaith>	Here, eoli3n, https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/f3b6bd19457e260b65d11f2712ec3da56cef463f/config-top.h#L65
Mar 01 08:36:59 <eoli3n>	Artfaith: that's bash
Mar 01 08:37:10 <Artfaith>	Well, don't you use Bash inside Cron?
Mar 01 08:37:13 <eoli3n>	i do

Mar 01 08:37:46 <steering>	eqw: neither did i :)
Mar 01 08:38:03 <steering>	did a `grep -r dmesg /etc/cron* /lib/systemd`
Mar 01 08:38:05 <eqw>	Why `systemctl edit dmesg.service` opens nano and not vim?
Mar 01 08:38:41 <Artfaith>	It must be EDITOR available there like EDITOR=vi systemctl...
Mar 01 08:39:38 <eqw>	that's a solution but sort of workaround
Mar 01 08:40:06 <eqw>	no, doesn't work
Mar 01 08:40:36 <Artfaith>	Am sorry, apparently it's SYSTEMD_EDITOR in this one.
Mar 01 08:44:21 <buraq>	if i need global variables, i just set them at the end of /etc/profile
Mar 01 08:44:34 <buraq>	/etc/environment might be a good place too
Mar 01 08:44:42 <buraq>	but i don't know if all distros have that
Mar 01 08:44:58 <Artfaith>	The /etc/env one looks like Arch.
Mar 01 08:45:13 <Artfaith>	~/.profile is the standard one for user.
Mar 01 08:45:22 <Artfaith>	/etc/profile for all
Mar 01 08:45:51 <Artfaith>	eqw, it could be compiled that way.
Mar 01 08:46:01 <eqw>	my choice is `update-alternatives --config editor`
Mar 01 08:46:02 <Artfaith>	I mean, your version of the executable.

Mar 01 08:48:15 <Artfaith>	RaimondRaj, there 2 recommended options to install Node: 1. From the official website; 2. nvm mentioned above.
Mar 01 08:48:22 <Artfaith>	there are*
Mar 01 08:49:26 <Artfaith>	nvm uses official website to install Node. Distributions repositories are not recommended since those are not maintained by anyone from Node but Communities and are not monitored.
Mar 01 08:50:09 <Artfaith>	`nvm` repo is owned by ljharb which is closely related to Node participating in TC39 and you may find them in related channel on Libera also.

Mar 01 08:59:01 <buraq>	atreo: yes they are compatible. where did you read they're not?
Mar 01 09:02:21 <RaimondRaj>	this is my ( https://pastebin.com/StK57t7w ) SSH - can anyone guide me on this
Mar 01 09:03:38 <atreo>	buraq: i remember several years ago the linux community here was complaining how difficult it is to install a GPU on linux and the main barrier to why very little games work on linux.

Mar 01 09:17:01 <Artfaith>	The thing is that Kernel modules are open source due to lack of any interface between module and Kernel, atreo. Windows has one, Linux - don't. So, in Windows, you could distribute a single driver and assume the kernel interface will handle it the same on different Windows builds. In Linux, nope. The module will require to know how to work on specific Linux (kernel) build, and hence, rebuilt, or to
Mar 01 09:17:03 <Artfaith>	put clear, every module should be rebuild for every kernel, normally. This results in modules shared in open source to be built at place. Sure thing some vendors don't want to share their code so openly also due to competitors and who knows what. Even if you can reverse engineer them, the most vendors assume you won't have time enough to do so, and continue to not distributing their module
Mar 01 09:17:05 <Artfaith>	out-of-the-box in the Linux distros requiring to install them manually from their source.
Mar 01 09:18:39 <atreo>	Artfaith: i see
Mar 01 09:20:07 <buraq>	endeavouros has the nvidia kernel in the installer, and i think ubuntu now too
Mar 01 09:20:18 <Artfaith>	Knowing that there's no standard/reliable well-defined interface for every Kernel module to distribute at, Nvidia, probably, doesn't want to risk their time and general resources trying to invest into supporting all the Kernels out there even major, and gives that opportunity to Kernel maintainers or Users.
Mar 01 09:21:13 <adv8tor>	RaimondRaj: try deleting libnode and auto remove if you haven't

Mar 01 09:26:16 <Artfaith>	e.g. > Been using nvidia GPUs with Linux since around 2000-2001. They've always provided Linux drivers that have worked well, with prompt support of new hardware. If you install and use the proprietary drivers things currently "just work" for the most part, at least on the destkop.

Mar 01 09:28:58 <xiaomiao>	Artfaith: I had a mostly-working setup with nvidia drivers once in May 2004
Mar 01 09:29:06 <Artfaith>	What did not work?
Mar 01 09:29:11 <xiaomiao>	that was the only time they didn't desire to immediately combust
Mar 01 09:29:34 <xiaomiao>	oh, usually crashes, extra fun: for a few years they reliably locked up the machine whenever a GTK+ app started
Mar 01 09:30:07 <stenno>	thanks
Mar 01 09:30:13 <xiaomiao>	when that didn't happen usually just "random" crashes, exciting stuff like the 24h shutdown bug (where the nvidia driver would trigger acpi events and make machines shut down) and such
Mar 01 09:30:13 <Artfaith>	Interesting. Are you sure it was the module issue? How did you figure it out?
Mar 01 09:30:35 <xiaomiao>	yes, very sure it was nvidia drivers because nv and vesa never showed those issues
Mar 01 09:33:50 <Artfaith>	xiaomiao, is it the following?
Mar 01 09:33:52 <Artfaith>	https://msfn.org/board/topic/174096-nvidia-video-driver-shutdown-fix/#comment-1102816
Mar 01 09:34:06 <Artfaith>	I mean, the CPU instruction.
Mar 01 09:34:54 <xiaomiao>	Artfaith: that looks like a hang on shutdown ... I had nvidia drivers *triggering* a shutdown
Mar 01 09:35:09 <wantyapps>	Sorry for all dis/connects
Mar 01 09:35:26 <Artfaith>	I didn't find a more specific bug related to the triggering. Is there a reference you know to read about it?

Mar 01 09:36:46 <xiaomiao>	what you definitely can find is the glorious ctrl-c stealer bug
Mar 01 09:37:13 <xiaomiao>	where the nvidia driver messed with signal handling in the kernel so badly that processes would not get signals reliably and thus ctrl-c had no effect
Mar 01 09:37:27 <Gamah>	is there a free/linux/homelab thing to replace jira?
Mar 01 09:37:29 <Artfaith>	wantyapps, just in case, if you want to have a more stable connection, I would recommend either Weechat relay or a bouncer like ZNC on your custom VPS or any 24/7 machine you own. There are bouncer services of course, too.
Mar 01 09:37:37 <Artfaith>	I use Weechat relay personally. Love it.
Mar 01 09:37:51 <xiaomiao>	Gamah: rt, bugzilla, flyspray, redmine, etc.
Mar 01 09:37:55 <Disconsented>	Gamah> https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted
Mar 01 09:38:13 <xiaomiao>	Gamah: they lack the pain and frustration of jira, so maybe they aren't /good/ replacements ;)
Mar 01 09:38:18 <Artfaith>	xiaomiao, I would appreciate a reference if found.
Mar 01 09:38:35 <Artfaith>	Anyways, it's awesome you solved it!
Mar 01 09:38:47 <Gamah>	xiaomiao: my manager regularly shits on me for doing doing things i "should" in jira and i usually say "my bad i'm just an engineer" so..
Mar 01 09:38:52 <Artfaith>	Gamah, more direct: https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted?tab=readme-ov-file#software-development---project-management
Mar 01 09:38:54 <Gamah>	for not doing*
Mar 01 09:39:06 <Gamah>	bugzilla sounds like an issue tracker
Mar 01 09:39:14 <Gamah>	i'm looking for more like project management? like "epics" and such...
Mar 01 09:39:55 <Gamah>	maybe the mor normie thing i'm referring to is something like monday.com
Mar 01 09:40:28 <Artfaith>	https://plane.so/
Mar 01 09:40:32 <Artfaith>	Looks promising.
Mar 01 09:41:01 <Gamah>	hmmmm
Mar 01 09:41:13 <Gamah>	10 teams per country
Mar 01 09:41:18 <Gamah>	that sounds like good penetration
Mar 01 09:41:34 <Gamah>	i have heard of 0 of the companies scrolling on the page lol
Mar 01 09:41:49 <Gamah>	"pricing" is it not FOSS?
Mar 01 09:42:29 <Gamah>	it's gpl okay.. hmm
Mar 01 09:43:06 <Gamah>	to be fair, jira is free for 10 users....
Mar 01 09:43:20 <Artfaith>	Pricing is for Plane Cloud
Mar 01 09:43:36 <Artfaith>	Not for self-hosted, I believe: https://docs.plane.so/docker-compose
Mar 01 09:44:22 <Gamah>	i'll bookmark it Artfaith.... it could work.
Mar 01 09:44:42 <Gamah>	docker tho
Mar 01 09:44:43 <Gamah>	ugh
Mar 01 09:44:48 <Gamah>	i'm using lxc on proxmox
Mar 01 09:45:17 <xiaomiao>	Gamah: "project management" is just issue tracking with fancy labels
Mar 01 09:45:37 <Artfaith>	Well, I would say it's more than that.
Mar 01 09:46:08 <buraq>	Gamah: redmine has project management
Mar 01 09:46:18 <Gamah>	xiaomiao: i won't outright disagree with you but something like bugzilla or even github's issue tracker is not what i'm looking for
Mar 01 09:46:19 <Artfaith>	Though, it depends on how we both see "issue tracking" definition in our environments to be fair.
Mar 01 09:46:30 <Gamah>	i am not looking for an issue tracker
Mar 01 09:46:31 <xiaomiao>	Gamah: then neither is jira
Mar 01 09:46:44 <xiaomiao>	my working theory is ... everything is an issue
Mar 01 09:46:46 <Gamah>	xiaomiao: agreed probably not, it's just what i know
Mar 01 09:46:56 <Gamah>	xiaomiao: right but grouping issues is nice
Mar 01 09:47:05 <Gamah>	and having kanban boards per epic is nice
Mar 01 09:47:06 <Artfaith>	xiaomiao, "...with solutions" I hope?
Mar 01 09:47:10 <xiaomiao>	yes that's why there are categories and labels
Mar 01 09:47:15 <Gamah>	there's probably similat terms in other products
Mar 01 09:47:19 <Gamah>	i don't think bugzilla does what i'm looking for
Mar 01 09:47:31 <xiaomiao>	Artfaith: solutions are mostly a financial problem - if the time and money to solve is not provided it's impossible
Mar 01 09:47:45 <Artfaith>	Bugzilla is about Bugs or more defined issues I believe.
Mar 01 09:47:54 <Artfaith>	Issues may be 'features', too.
Mar 01 09:48:05 <xiaomiao>	even travel booking can be an issue
Mar 01 09:48:08 <Gamah>	xiaomiao: no need to build a saturnV capable of landing on the moon if all you need to do is drive to the grocery store, i get that.
Mar 01 09:48:32 <xiaomiao>	Gamah: I dislike the needless complexity and confusion of most of the "modern" tools
Mar 01 09:48:40 <xiaomiao>	just get stuff done
Mar 01 09:49:16 <Gamah>	xiaomiao: yeah i'm trying to plan long term projects for myself... not "get stuff done" in a day to day workflow that is meaninfully productive
Mar 01 09:50:23 <xiaomiao>	Gamah: that sounds like an issue tracker to me. maybe with fancy labels and stuff if you like to put labels on things
Mar 01 09:50:33 <Gamah>	sure, which do you recommend?
Mar 01 09:51:23 <Artfaith>	Gamah, if it's for personal notes, too, to accompany the issue tracker, I will suggest miraculous https://obsidian.md .
Mar 01 09:51:46 <Gamah>	Artfaith: nah that's too much onenote
Mar 01 09:51:52 <Gamah>	not task centric enough
Mar 01 09:52:08 <Artfaith>	It's for personal notes, sure.
Mar 01 09:52:29 <Artfaith>	I believe it could help during development/personal projects.
Mar 01 09:52:51 <fb`>	Hey obsidian looks interesting, looking to ditch evernote
Mar 01 09:52:52 <Gamah>	yeah i want an "issue tracker" forward project management thing... i think plane is closer
Mar 01 09:53:32 <fb`>	Basecamp is pretty good but more for group collab
Mar 01 09:54:33 <Gamah>	i don't need multiuser... i just want "kanban" boards per project for all the dumb shit i want to do with computers in my house lol
Mar 01 09:54:52 <Artfaith>	fb`, it may surprize once you dig deeper. The Community, open source plugins due to the API, cross-platform (including official Android builds), UX/UI, and overly permissive environment for any kind of customization...
Mar 01 09:55:32 <Artfaith>	e.g. Google "graph obsidian"
Mar 01 09:59:35 <fb`>	Quite advanced for such a new app
Mar 01 10:01:52 <Artfaith>	I like that you can tie personal Git repo with it since it's just files, and there's even a plugin for it to automate it. Also, it being working similarly in Debian and Android, the same plugin works in both to keep it in sync but in personal servers.
Mar 01 10:02:14 <Artfaith>	Like Gitea, for example.
Mar 01 10:03:05 <Artfaith>	Or just a safe and secure chrooted git listening on port somewhere sure.
Mar 01 10:05:07 <Gamah>	Artfaith: yeah the issues i'm tracking are not necessarilly tied to code
Mar 01 10:05:20 <Gamah>	it's more like: replace VM with container, still accepts openvpn connections
Mar 01 10:09:13 <fb`>	Feels like cloud notes apps are dime a dozen, uncertain future, etc. Looked into self-hosting, played with TWiki a bit, it's not very polished
Mar 01 10:09:33 <buraq>	lpadmin: Printer drivers are deprecated and will stop working in a future version of CUPS.
Mar 01 10:09:45 <buraq>	what happens with the printer ppd files now?
Mar 01 10:10:53 <Artfaith>	Just in case, Obsidian is not cloud but a local program. They provide with remove sync for donation if desired though. I donated them, but prefer personal Git.
Mar 01 10:11:55 <Artfaith>	remote*
Mar 01 10:14:44 <fb`>	So Obsidian is local but closed source? Is git the backing store? I'll check the docs
Mar 01 10:18:32 <adv8tor>	Yeah they have a GitHub repo that only has releases which I think is super sketchy
Mar 01 10:29:31 <lockywolf>	is there a full list of linux contributors?
Mar 01 10:29:39 <lockywolf>	kernel contributors, I mean
Mar 01 10:31:29 <Gamah>	lockywolf: the git history
Mar 01 10:32:35 <lockywolf>	Gamah: yeah, but that's tedious to query and filter
Mar 01 10:34:24 <neoncortex>	maybe this?  https://planet.kernel.org/
Mar 01 10:35:05 <Gamah>	lockywolf: it's a tedious question to want to answer, no?
Mar 01 10:35:13 <neoncortex>	it does not look complete by any means, and Im not sure everyone there contributes.  I got that link here: https://www.kernel.org/category/contact-us.html
Mar 01 10:49:24 <fb`>	lockywolf how's this - https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/
Mar 01 10:51:47 <fb`>	lockywolf how's this: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/
Mar 01 10:52:10 <fb`>	Sorry if dupe..was dc'd
Mar 01 11:02:10 <The_Blode>	Good morning all. @Gamah just in response to your question...I too just want a Kanban app...got one on Windows which works great but it's not available on Linux. However, falling short of the web instances which one could build, there is Affine (https://affine.pro/download) which can be used in a purely Kanban style if you wish with the ability to seperate out projects hope this helps
Mar 01 11:03:09 <The_Blode>	The link to Affine is here -> https://affine.pro/ it's built in an AppImage for convenience or can be compiled from source
Mar 01 11:04:13 <respawn>	The_Blode: https://alternativeto.net/software/kanbantool/
Mar 01 12:16:16 <ZAJDAN>	Hi...I created /etc/profile.d/hostnames.sh which contains env variables. Need to be something restarted to print the variables?
Mar 01 12:17:49 <ZAJDAN>	ha! I found it...logout and login a they are usable
Mar 01 12:18:19 <Inline>	yeah they are source when a terminal with a shell session is spawned
Mar 01 12:18:28 <Inline>	otherwise you have to manually source it
Mar 01 12:20:35 <ZAJDAN>	thank you
Mar 01 12:21:07 <kdbxw>	I write a PHP web app and some Python daemons which write log files with debug records, errors with stack traces etc. It works well with grep, tail and lnav.
Mar 01 12:21:49 <kdbxw>	Nevertheless I think probably something just little bit more advanced than these log files is required. Like storage or format or something where multiline entries treated as single records, and records themselves are structured therefore can be searched by specific field, and some simple UI maybe.
Mar 01 12:22:32 <kdbxw>	But when I start looking at other approaches it all seems to me complicated and demanding. A guy at work suggested that probably we need some cloud logs provider, but I am skeptical to clouds for some reason.
Mar 01 12:22:54 <kdbxw>	Q: When one wants an improvement over plain text logs, Isn't there any kind of simple solution by chance? Like spent 20% effort and get 70% benefit?
Mar 01 12:26:12 <fb`>	There is always sqlite if you want to structure the logs. Allows advanced query, etc
Mar 01 12:29:38 <kdbxw>	fb`, writing to sqlite or separate postgres is exactly the solution I contemplated in case there is nothing else will suit me. probably there is something in it.
Mar 01 12:34:22 <fb`>	Yes, there are a few ways to interpret 'simple solution'. A local database does limit dependencies (no cloud) though you will need to write an interface layer and manage the schema, etc
Mar 01 12:41:15 <kdbxw>	fb`, writing to db be it sqlite or postgres is the simplest. I did that years ago with mysql. I thought probably there is some better way already invented
Mar 01 12:42:00 <fb`>	Sorry if dupe, was dc'd again... my last msg: Yes, there are a few ways to interpret 'simple solution'. A local database does limit dependencies (no cloud) though you will need to write an interface layer and manage the schema, etc
Mar 01 12:47:00 <fb`>	Database may be a good approach then, since you are familiar. Of course higher level (3rd party) log tools are available but you have to beware of any dependencies and ongoing support with that
Mar 01 12:56:35 <ZAJDAN>	I define env variables(/etc/profile.d/hosts) in bash script and at the end of the scipt I call 'source /etc/profile.d/hosts'. When the scipt finish I do printenv HELLO, but nothing is shown. When i call 'source /etc/profile.d/hosts.sh' out of the script manualy it print the variables.
Mar 01 12:57:37 <spine-o-saurus>	whats the difference between #define SOMTHING, and just a normal function?
Mar 01 12:58:40 <fb`>	ZAJDAN You do not want to source the script in the script file itself, the shell will load from /etc/profile.d on login
Mar 01 12:59:09 <ananke>	kdbxw: for self hosted you can do either splunk (which can be quite expensive, depending on your data volume), or open source approach is via ELK stack (elastic search, logstash, kibana)
Mar 01 12:59:47 <ananke>	spine-o-saurus: ask in #whatever_language_it_may_be
Mar 01 13:03:23 <ZAJDAN>	fb`: is not necessary logOut and logIn...it works even when I do: source /etc/profile.d/hosts.sh  ..manualy after that the scipt finish
Mar 01 13:05:17 <pankaj>	I am trying to set my modifications in '.Xresources' but unable to understand how do I get the list of resources and setup suitable options in that file. Is their any resource that you would recommend that are more recent and also easier to understand.
Mar 01 13:06:25 <fb`>	Yes, that manually sources the file at any time. I was referring to "and at the end of the scipt I call...", it sounded like you are putting 'source' in the script - you do not want to do that
Mar 01 13:09:47 <ZAJDAN>	fb`: Yes the idea was do all in one script (create_env_var.sh), but source the file in which the variables are created is not possible in the scipt.
Mar 01 13:11:11 <fairway>	currently my internet ipv6 is working but not ipv4.  why is internet almost useless without ipv4
Mar 01 13:12:12 <Paddy_NI>	oh my god I am such a buffoon, I quit irssi and upon reopening it I am no longer connected to the "rclone" irc channel I had found.
Mar 01 13:12:45 <Paddy_NI>	I have absolutely no idea what network it was on either and my google skills are failing me right now.
Mar 01 13:14:42 <RaimondRaj>	dpkg: error: cannot access archive '/var/cache/apt/archives/nvidia-340_340.107-0ubuntu0~gpu18.04.1_amd64.deb': No such file or directory
Mar 01 13:14:43 <fb`>	ZAJDAN You may need to include the 'export' keyword before the variables you want to export. You can source external script files in the script itself as well
Mar 01 13:14:54 <RaimondRaj>	the problem start with node.js install
Mar 01 13:15:27 <Paddy_NI>	Ah ha! Panic averted
Mar 01 13:15:41 <Paddy_NI>	I must have mistyped before
Mar 01 13:16:09 <ananke>	RaimondRaj: are you expecting us to guess what command you ran?
Mar 01 13:16:17 <RaimondRaj>	non
Mar 01 13:16:20 <RaimondRaj>	i need help
Mar 01 13:16:38 <RaimondRaj>	i useing Ubuntu 22.04 TLS
Mar 01 13:17:01 <daniie>	ananke: He is spamming other channels as well with the same information
Mar 01 13:17:09 <RaimondRaj>	i haveing thsi problem with install TheLounge and endup problem
Mar 01 13:17:14 <ananke>	daniie: color me surprised
Mar 01 13:17:25 <RaimondRaj>	not spamming
Mar 01 13:17:36 <xx>	crossposting is kind of spammy
Mar 01 13:17:36 <RaimondRaj>	i seeking for kind and help
Mar 01 13:17:38 <ZAJDAN>	fb` yes I do it export VARNAME="value"
Mar 01 13:18:24 <ananke>	RaimondRaj: you still didn't tell us what actual commands you ran
Mar 01 13:20:13 <fairway>	currently my internet ipv6 is working but not ipv4.  why is internet almost useless without ipv4
Mar 01 13:20:26 <ananke>	fairway: why is the sky blue?
Mar 01 13:20:36 <fairway>	wtf
Mar 01 13:20:36 <xx>	because ipv6 was made needlessly complicated
Mar 01 13:20:38 <fb`>	ZAJDAN Good. You can try to include 'set -x' as the first command in your script to test if it runs at login
Mar 01 13:20:47 <xx>	should have been ipv6 basic and then various optional extensions
Mar 01 13:21:01 <fairway>	my modem has ipv6 address but not ipv4 address
Mar 01 13:21:10 <fairway>	so  youtube/google works
Mar 01 13:21:42 <Namarrgon>	are you supposed to have an ipv4 address or is that by contract a ipv6-only connection?
Mar 01 13:21:44 <ananke>	fairway: that's an enchanting story
Mar 01 13:22:01 <fairway>	i am suppose to have ipv4 address
Mar 01 13:22:04 <fairway>	too
Mar 01 13:22:35 <fb`>	maybe try turning the modem off and on again?
Mar 01 13:22:48 <fairway>	fb` done like that 30 times already
Mar 01 13:22:54 <fairway>	done that like*
Mar 01 13:23:02 <ananke>	sounds like an issue to take up with your ISP
Mar 01 13:23:15 <RaimondRaj>	 i try to install node.js on ubuntu its happen
Mar 01 13:23:17 <fairway>	why can't internet properly with just ipv6
Mar 01 13:23:21 <RaimondRaj>	i dopnt know what is that a
Mar 01 13:23:29 <fairway>	why can't internet properly work with just ipv6
Mar 01 13:23:30 <ZAJDAN>	fb`: https://termbin.com/0h7q
Mar 01 13:23:34 <Namarrgon>	it does as long as the servers you're connecting to reply on ipv6
Mar 01 13:25:48 <fb`>	ZAJDAN What is the full path/filename to that script on your system?
Mar 01 13:25:50 <ananke>	it's like asking 'why can't everybody just get along', and expecting simple answer like 'ohh, we're on it'
Mar 01 13:26:53 <fb`>	or like asking 'why can't you understand me' to someone that only speaks german
Mar 01 13:27:45 <ZAJDAN>	fb`: /home/zajdan/create_env_var.sh
Mar 01 13:27:54 <ananke>	yeah, everybody should speak english, what's the hold up?
Mar 01 13:30:46 <fb`>	ZAJDAN That looks ok. Check if your `/etc/profile` has a section like `for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh`
Mar 01 13:35:18 <pankaj>	Is their any other resource other than 'slackware book 2.0 pdf' so I can learn more about vanilla linux in deep??
Mar 01 13:36:07 <ZAJDAN>	fb`: yes it is there: for s in /etc/profile.d/*.sh ; do
Mar 01 13:36:47 <fb`>	ZAJDAN And 1) confirm that /etc/profile.d/hosts.sh has those variables inside. 2) chmod +r /etc/profile.d/hosts.sh
Mar 01 13:36:52 <ananke>	pankaj: what does 'vanilla linux' mean to you? because learning about slackware 2.0 is like learning about cars by studying a ford model T manual
Mar 01 13:38:42 <fb`>	pankaj check out Linux From Scratch
Mar 01 13:40:42 <ZAJDAN>	fb`: 1) has the variables inside 2) -rwxr-xr-x
Mar 01 13:44:56 <peac>	pankaj: i would recommend building archlinux for a good primer
Mar 01 13:45:35 <peac>	(grabs popcorn)
Mar 01 13:46:23 <fairway>	why does so websites does not work with ipv6
Mar 01 13:46:32 <fairway>	so many*
Mar 01 13:47:22 <spine-o-saurus>	cause granpa said, 'if it still works, don't fix it!'
Mar 01 13:48:46 <peac>	fairway: unfortunately a lot of the servers out there still rely on hardcoded ipv4 addresses, and i've read recently somewhere (don't ask source, don't have it) that some ISPs would stop providing ipv4 to customers to force the transition
Mar 01 13:49:17 <fairway>	wtf is hardcoded ipv4
Mar 01 13:49:23 <fairway>	what is that even mean
Mar 01 13:49:48 <spine-o-saurus>	router cant be updated
Mar 01 13:50:10 <ananke>	fairway: because the world doesn't revolve around your wishes
Mar 01 13:50:32 <Gurkenglas>	I can buy that even if a machine lets a user use sudo without asking for a password, making them actually write sudo still serves as a safeguard against accidentally breaking something. Why does dmesg, which only reads, say "dmesg: read kernel buffer failed: Operation not permitted" though?
Mar 01 13:51:07 <ananke>	Gurkenglas: because it may leak sensitive data
Mar 01 13:51:39 <Thurmond>	Is there a generic name for all certificates that are NOT CA certificates?
Mar 01 13:52:05 <ananke>	Gurkenglas: it's a 'least privilege' approach. you don't get to read system logs, unless you have an actual need to do so.
Mar 01 13:53:10 <Thurmond>	what peac said about 'hardcoded ipv4' doesn't make sense.
Mar 01 13:53:43 <Gurkenglas>	fair enough, the same argument does apply to read as write, thanks.
Mar 01 13:53:56 <pankaj>	ananke: You are right. I want to learn about cars but I am not finding any way other then learning from ford model T manual. I have used arch and also build LFS. But I want to know traditional way of doing things in linux.
Mar 01 13:54:54 <Namarrgon>	there is no "traditional" way, LFS is as vanilla is at gets
Mar 01 13:55:16 <ananke>	pankaj: problem is, ford model T does not represent modern cars anymore. big portion of technologies used back then (in slackware 2.0 era) are no longer used.
Mar 01 13:55:21 <Namarrgon>	everything else is "tainted" by distro policies
Mar 01 13:55:21 <pankaj>	Namarrgon: Any books or pdfs you would recommend.
Mar 01 13:55:26 <Namarrgon>	for LFS?
Mar 01 13:56:10 <Thurmond>	ananke, eh.  a lot of the fundamentals are still the same.  and even the things that have changed haven't changed so much that learning the old way isn't instructive.
Mar 01 13:56:14 <pankaj>	Namarrgon: No.
Mar 01 13:56:29 <ananke>	Thurmond: and a lot are not, and downright useless
Mar 01 13:56:37 <Namarrgon>	*as it gets
Mar 01 13:56:40 <Thurmond>	plus, you can make some money working on some of those older systems that still exist
Mar 01 13:56:46 <Thurmond>	ananke, like what:
Mar 01 13:56:48 <ananke>	learning ipfwadm, or kernel 2.2.x intricacies is useless
Mar 01 13:56:58 <ananke>	Thurmond: yeah, that's utter bs
Mar 01 13:57:05 <peac>	Thurmond: i'm personally setting reverse proxies and stuff using public ipv4 addresses written in text files.
Mar 01 13:57:08 <Thurmond>	bah.  that's a tiny fraction of 'linux'
Mar 01 13:57:15 <ZAJDAN>	fb`: I found the way how...source /home/zajdan/create_env_var.sh and inside the script '. /etc/profile.d/hosts.sh' instead of 'source /etc/profile.d/hosts.sh'
Mar 01 13:57:17 <fairway>	why does libera support ipv6 but discord/github does not
Mar 01 13:57:29 <ananke>	fairway: ask them.
Mar 01 13:57:49 <Thurmond>	and firewalling methods are practically fashion.  understanding stateful forwarding is useful regardless of what tool you use to get there.
Mar 01 13:58:37 <ananke>	one doesn't need an antique source to learn about those
Mar 01 13:58:57 <spine-o-saurus>	it belongs in a museum!
Mar 01 13:59:29 <jprjr>	I guess the "traditional way" really depends on industry/job.
Mar 01 13:59:46 <jprjr>	You work in a big enterprise, or for the US government? RHEL is "traditional"

Mar 01 14:01:16 *	Topic for #linux set by Khaytsus (Thu Aug  3 13:54:32 2023)
Mar 01 14:01:18 <ananke>	Thurmond: point being, one is not limited to those antique resources
Mar 01 14:01:19 <Thurmond>	though you're still an extra learning step away from understanding more modern systems.  but the leap between understanding ONE system and understanding "ALL" (limited) systems is always the next boundary anyway
Mar 01 14:01:34 <ananke>	this isn't 1995, and you're not on an island stuck without internet access
Mar 01 14:01:50 <Thurmond>	i didn't say i was.
Mar 01 14:01:58 <Thurmond>	even in 1995, i wasn't stuck on an island.  ;)
Mar 01 14:02:14 <ananke>	'but if that's what you HAVE' implied that
Mar 01 14:02:27 <Thurmond>	ananke, no it didn't
Mar 01 14:02:38 <Thurmond>	you ASSUMED an AWFUL lot based on what i actually said
Mar 01 14:02:44 <Thurmond>	you can't always just update what you want
Mar 01 14:02:50 <peac>	fairway: you may try using a vpn to access those, with a little bit of luck you'll connect over ipv6 and it will relay ipv4 traffic
Mar 01 14:03:00 <jprjr>	I mean once you learn the say, the concept of a stateful firewall, your questions change from "what is a firewall?" to "ok how do I enable connection tracking on *this* system?"
Mar 01 14:03:01 <Thurmond>	case in point, i recently finished a job working on a 1998 RedHat 7.2 (Valhalla) system
Mar 01 14:03:05 <Thurmond>	it CANNOT be updated
Mar 01 14:03:23 <Khaytsus>	YIKES
Mar 01 14:03:23 <djph>	Thurmond: ouch
Mar 01 14:03:32 <ananke>	Thurmond: so you're not talking about _documentation_ which is what pankaj is asking for, rather a some anecdotical example of an actual antique system
Mar 01 14:03:35 <Thurmond>	yeah i really had to dust off some memories for that one
Mar 01 14:03:47 <jprjr>	So it's probably *more* useful to learn current tech but even learning the old tech has some value since you pick up the higher-level concepts.
Mar 01 14:03:52 <djph>	Thurmond: so it's gonna slam hard into the 32-bit time_t 2038 problem, huh?
Mar 01 14:04:00 <Thurmond>	djph, yep
Mar 01 14:04:25 <Thurmond>	djph, they ARE working on replacing it, but it's not going to be fast.
Mar 01 14:04:33 <Thurmond>	might take until 2030 ;)
Mar 01 14:04:46 <jprjr>	Or at least, assuming you pick up the higher-level concepts. if all you learn is the actual steps to take and not *why* you take them then yeah, learning old tech isn't very useful but I'd argue you're not really learning anyway.
Mar 01 14:05:39 <djph>	Thurmond: never is :)
Mar 01 14:11:07 <irgendwer4711>	hi, how to filter a mail with Sieve for one weekday?
Mar 01 14:13:44 <lopid>	https://p5r.uk/blog/2011/sieve-tutorial.html#non-address-header
Mar 01 14:16:05 <Gurkenglas>	I'd like to close down a Linux installation. I could save a dd of /dev/sda3 because storage is cheap, but I'd like to know the proper way to do this. I imagine it involves writing a script that installs a system close to that one onto a fresh /dev/sda4, mounting both, replacing every file/directory in sda3 with a recursively identical counterpart
Mar 01 14:16:05 <Gurkenglas>	in sda4 with a symlink to it, deleting /dev/sda4, and saving the script and a dd of /dev/sda3.
Mar 01 14:16:31 <irgendwer4711>	lopid: I have a rule, but it does not work: currentday :contains "weekday" "1"
Mar 01 14:17:08 <Gurkenglas>	Though that wouldn't automatically preserve timestamps. Can I save those separately? Are there tools I should be using?
Mar 01 14:17:36 <ananke>	Gurkenglas: what does 'to close down a Linux installation' mean? are you trying to create a clone of an existing install?
Mar 01 14:17:52 <lopid>	is currentday a thing? https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3028
Mar 01 14:18:04 <Gurkenglas>	ananke, nah, just uninstall it, but without losing anything I did on it
Mar 01 14:18:17 <Gurkenglas>	(much like uninstalling a package keeps config files)
Mar 01 14:18:35 <irgendwer4711>	lopid: my rule is ignored
Mar 01 14:19:18 <ananke>	Gurkenglas: uhmm, say what? you want to 'uninstall' an entire operating system and have any custom data remain? what's your anticipated end result?
Mar 01 14:19:48 <Gurkenglas>	something like a diskimage.iso.zip only moreso
Mar 01 14:20:09 <Gurkenglas>	((assuming .iso is what you call the file extension of what dd spits out)
Mar 01 14:20:13 <irgendwer4711>	lopid: I meant currentdate
Mar 01 14:20:14 <lemonzest>	just clonezilla ir
Mar 01 14:20:17 <lemonzest>	*it
Mar 01 14:20:35 <peac>	Gurkenglas: do you want to keep your old system for archiving only ?
Mar 01 14:20:44 <ananke>	Gurkenglas: and after you have said image, what would you use it for? is the goal to inject it into another system?
Mar 01 14:20:45 <lopid>	irgendwer4711, "currentdate": https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5260.html#page-6
Mar 01 14:21:08 <Gurkenglas>	lemonzest: then the archive couldn't make use of the fact that almost all of the filesystem contents are just packages that one doesn't need to save a copy of, right?
Mar 01 14:21:32 <Gurkenglas>	ananke: sure, or the same one
Mar 01 14:21:46 <lemonzest>	so you want a diff between an installed system and your current and only save the changes?
Mar 01 14:21:51 <irgendwer4711>	lopid: yes, typo in chat
Mar 01 14:22:06 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 01 14:22:06 *	litharge sets ban on $a:KashinKoji$##fix_your_connection
Mar 01 14:22:17 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 01 14:22:37 <JanC>	if you know what you want to keep, just copy that...
Mar 01 14:22:41 <ananke>	Gurkenglas: unless it's an identical system, you wouldn't be able to easily drop random things into it, outside of maybe /home and some very specific data directories. beyond that, saving /etc and then manually restoring required components would be the only feasible approach
Mar 01 14:22:45 <Gurkenglas>	lemonzest: that is indeed the means by which i would expect to achieve my end of being able to get back to this state while also freeing up almost all of the used disk space
Mar 01 14:27:08 <Karyon>	irgendwer4711: Wouldn't the comparator be 'is' rather than 'contains'?
Mar 01 14:27:12 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 01 14:27:13 *	litharge sets ban on *!*@2.82.62.124
Mar 01 14:27:14 *	litharge has kicked KashinKoji from #linux (Discuss your ban in #linux-ops.)
Mar 01 14:27:23 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 01 14:27:48 <JanC>	if you have backups, those should already have everything, right?  ;)
Mar 01 14:28:34 <irgendwer4711>	Karyon: I used a roundcube plugin.
Mar 01 14:29:08 <irgendwer4711>	I changed that to is now to give it a try
Mar 01 14:29:46 <JanC>	but in addition to /etc and /home, make sure to make database dumps (if you use database servers like Postgres or MySQL), and use you package manager to create a list of installed packages
Mar 01 14:30:13 <Gurkenglas>	ananke: surely using the same OS installer and installing the same package versions would end up with more than 90% of the files identical?
Mar 01 14:30:46 <JanC>	assuming the OS is still available by then
Mar 01 14:31:00 <irgendwer4711>	ok got it
Mar 01 14:31:00 <JanC>	and of course some packages would be newer versions
Mar 01 14:31:19 <JanC>	also, if you have web or mail servers on that system you want to backup their data directories too
Mar 01 14:31:26 <JanC>	or anything similar
Mar 01 14:31:33 <peac>	hahah Gurgenklas probably mistyped a ctrl w or ctrl q
Mar 01 14:31:44 <JanC>	eh
Mar 01 14:31:52 <JanC>	oh well...
Mar 01 14:32:04 <Karyon>	irgendwer4711: Nice :)
Mar 01 14:33:24 <irgendwer4711>	changed it to not "not is" "1"
Mar 01 14:33:50 <irgendwer4711>	funny, that mails come from a ups every day to tell me, it got ntp time :-D
Mar 01 14:36:58 <Gurkenglas>	(connection issue, how many lines long is my last consecutive block of lines? last line i received ends with "feasible approach".)
Mar 01 14:37:22 <peac>	surely using the same OS installer and installing the same package versions would end up with more than 90% of the files identical?
Mar 01 14:38:37 <Gurkenglas>	damn, thats a while.
Mar 01 14:38:42 <Gurkenglas>	peac, yes, archiving only
Mar 01 14:38:50 <Gurkenglas>	ananke: i don't expect /home to turn into a symlink - if i wrote a script, it might start by replacing every file that has an identical counterpart with a symlink, then replace every directory containing only symlinks with a symlink as long as possible
Mar 01 14:38:53 <Gurkenglas>	(and if in practice the latter only gets negligible savings, i suppose we can skip it)
Mar 01 14:41:44 <peetaur>	peac: more than 90% of which files? for files extracted from the package, more like 100% ...but some is generated (ssh keys for example)...some metadata and logs have timestamps, etc.
Mar 01 14:42:10 <peac>	peetaur: i was giving Gurkenglas his last message
Mar 01 14:49:29 <hangint3n>	morning ladies and gents
Mar 01 14:50:06 <pell_>	hangint3n: hi
Mar 01 14:50:55 <hangint3n>	did i miss anything interesting?
Mar 01 14:51:22 <hangint3n>	.w ottawa
Mar 01 14:53:48 <peac>	Gurkenglas: can you give more context of what you expect to really end up with ? i usually have /home as a separate partition to keep all user files between reinstalls, and when i modify package settings that i want to keep it usually happens in /etc so i keep track of those specific files in a git repo
Mar 01 14:54:58 <Gurkenglas>	peac: i was trying to get by without making the kinds of assumptions that would in practice fail to actually do the same thing as just making a dd archive
Mar 01 14:56:12 <peac>	when reinstalling i remount /home and reinstall a cleaned up list of packages extracted from previous install's package manager, and either copy or link files in /etc
Mar 01 14:56:57 <peac>	timestamps don't really matter for those, and i think files in /etc are mostly owned by root (didn't check)
Mar 01 14:57:09 <Gurkenglas>	we can think of my question as, "what's the usual way to do better compression by assuming that the compression and decompression algorithm get access to an immutable trove of all versions of all packages published so far"
Mar 01 14:57:45 <peac>	you can clean up your package manager for previous software versions
Mar 01 14:57:57 <peac>	if you actually remove the packages you may loose config files
Mar 01 14:58:01 <ananke>	dd doesn't produce an 'archive', it's an image. archive is somethign you can access with applications
Mar 01 14:58:20 <peac>	you can use ncdu or the such to check for heavy files and remove them after archiving your system
Mar 01 15:00:12 <peac>	(i'm using archiving in a broader sense here, ie having the data somewhere else than where you boot, which dd would make a valid instance of)
Mar 01 15:00:41 <ioria>	depending on the pkg manager, remove does not always remove configs; purge does
Mar 01 15:00:56 <peac>	depending on the packages themselves also
Mar 01 15:02:53 <peac>	we lost them again
Mar 01 15:03:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	Gurkenglas  what is your real goal you are trying to do please
Mar 01 15:03:16 <peac>	RIP Gurkenglas' internet
Mar 01 15:04:27 <peac>	Southern_Gentlem: afaiu they're trying to make storage-efficient backups of their current install
Mar 01 15:07:16 <peac>	but with elaborate language conversions from german and circovoluted explainations

Mar 01 19:06:35 <NyB>	Southern_Gentlem: I _have_ a different controller
Mar 01 19:07:55 <Anjor>	minicom?
Mar 01 19:08:42 <Anjor>	pyserial?
Mar 01 19:09:01 <Anjor>	putty? It can do serial ports for RS-485 mode
Mar 01 19:12:12 <NyB>	well, for testing I use minicom
Mar 01 19:12:27 <NyB>	I have a couple of those cheap mixed 422/485 controllers
Mar 01 19:12:41 <NyB>	actually, now I wonder if it might not need to be set to 485 mode
Mar 01 19:14:03 <BrokenCog>	query regarding elogind:  does elogind require a logged in non-root user to be in some special group for elogind to lock the screen on lid close??  syslog shows elogin rule responding to the lid close, and claiming to lock the screen however it isn't doing so.
Mar 01 19:19:54 <MrElendig>	distro dependent
Mar 01 19:20:19 <ayecee>	huh. i changed my ssh port to 2222 to reduce log noise but there's still quite a bit. I guess the bots check that port too.
Mar 01 19:21:01 <Khaytsus>	I wound up just closing it entirely, gotta be on my VPN (wireguard)
Mar 01 19:21:19 <BrokenCog>	more affective to use firewall to tarpit bots.
Mar 01 19:21:24 <Khaytsus>	Watching bots try to login  as administrator was only amusing for so long
Mar 01 19:21:32 <ayecee>	heh. affective.
Mar 01 19:21:38 <Trel>	Technically `rm -fr /` will remove the French language from your computer.
Mar 01 19:21:44 <Khaytsus>	Useless to block or tarpit.. there are thousands at any given second
Mar 01 19:21:46 <uwharrie>	I've taken to tracking and blocking entire ASNs after a couple brute force attempts from the same one
Mar 01 19:21:50 <NyB>	OK, so the things work fine in 485 mode... I suspect they don't have an explicit switch, and it's just a matter of wiring (422 has two wire pairs)
Mar 01 19:21:53 <Khaytsus>	Trel: NO destructive commands
Mar 01 19:21:55 <ayecee>	Trel: no destructive commands please, even as a joke.
Mar 01 19:21:56 <Khaytsus>	You shoudl know this
Mar 01 19:21:59 <ayecee>	ahh, too slow.
Mar 01 19:22:13 <Trel>	Khaytsus: doesn't it need an extra switch to actually work?
Mar 01 19:22:17 <Khaytsus>	Trel: I don't care.
Mar 01 19:22:33 <Khaytsus>	That may vary from system to system.
Mar 01 19:22:42 <NyB>	it does by version, for sure
Mar 01 19:22:53 <Trel>	I thought it was standard or I wouldn't have made the joke here.
Mar 01 19:22:54 <ayecee>	it's a gnu flag. you can tell by the double dash.
Mar 01 19:23:03 <NyB>	Trel: definitely not standard
Mar 01 19:23:12 <Khaytsus>	Trel: Would you tell someone to put a gun to their head?  Oh, but make sure it's not loaded!
Mar 01 19:23:18 <Khaytsus>	Just don't
Mar 01 19:23:25 <ayecee>	that escalated quickly
Mar 01 19:23:40 <BrokenCog>	if anyone has a suggestion on elogind ...
Mar 01 19:23:50 *	NyB does not even know what elogind is
Mar 01 19:23:53 <Trel>	Again it was because I thought it wasn't destructive without the extra flag. I wouldn't have sent it otherwise.
Mar 01 19:24:05 <Khaytsus>	Cool
Mar 01 19:24:22 <ayecee>	BrokenCog: regarding what
Mar 01 19:24:46 <BrokenCog>	questoin at 10:14
Mar 01 19:25:04 <ayecee>	not scrolling back for it.
Mar 01 19:25:45 <Trel>	just searched it's apparently the systemd login stuff extracted from systemd for things that depend on it in a non systemd setup
Mar 01 19:26:52 <NyB>	huh, OK so --preserve-root actually _is_ in POSIX
Mar 01 19:26:57 <ayecee>	BrokenCog: problem with that is only the people who saw your question and remember it and chose not to answer can respond.
Mar 01 19:27:17 <NyB>	"If either of the files dot or dot-dot are specified as the basename portion of an operand (that is, the final pathname component) or if an operand resolves to the root directory, rm shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and do nothing more with such operands."
Mar 01 19:27:33 <NyB>	well, not the flag itself, but the behavior it's gating
Mar 01 19:27:37 <wantyapps>	back from dinner
Mar 01 19:27:57 <BrokenCog>	query regarding elogind:  does elogind require a logged in non-root user to be in some special group for elogind to lock the screen on lid close??  syslog shows elogin rule responding to the lid close, and claiming to lock the screen however it isn't doing so.
Mar 01 19:28:14 <NyB>	since 2008, apparently.
Mar 01 19:28:21 <BrokenCog>	ayecee: /\
Mar 01 19:28:34 <ayecee>	BrokenCog: what's the wording of the log message regarding locking the screen?
Mar 01 19:28:41 <BrokenCog>	one sec ...
Mar 01 19:29:02 <NyB>	and coreutils has defaulted to --preserve-root since 2006. I guess I may have just dated myself :p
Mar 01 19:29:42 <uwharrie>	when did long options make it in the POSIX spec?
Mar 01 19:29:59 <ayecee>	the behavior, not the flag, is part of the spec, he says.
Mar 01 19:30:33 <ayecee>	wonder which posix version brought that in

Mar 02 03:06:07 <John_Ivan>	does anyone know any self hosted blogging software that specifically returns search results with a thumbnail that was added as a post's main header/thumb?
Mar 02 03:09:42 <Khaytsus>	John_Ivan: heh you have lots of very specific needs :D
Mar 02 03:10:09 <John_Ivan>	Khaytsus, I do T_T. I'm faced with situations where I have to make such requirements.
Mar 02 03:10:13 <espresso>	John_Ivan: I don't offhand, but imagine that should be relatively easy with Drupal and MODX, and maybe with others like WordPress, Ghost, Grav
Mar 02 03:10:34 <John_Ivan>	espresso, yeah, thing is, all blogs I've seen return a mere list. no thumbnails.
Mar 02 03:10:49 <espresso>	well, that's a pretty specific requirement
Mar 02 03:11:00 <Khaytsus>	Ghost's search is still pretty sad :/
Mar 02 03:11:13 <Khaytsus>	not sure about rss
Mar 02 03:11:24 <John_Ivan>	Khaytsus, it comes down to ultimately utilizing media that is very image oriented. "search by thumb" is the problem I'm faced with.
Mar 02 03:11:44 <John_Ivan>	Khaytsus, so while tags and properties help, I still NEED to see the data I search
Mar 02 03:11:54 <John_Ivan>	it's impossible to work with text alone
Mar 02 03:12:35 <John_Ivan>	Khaytsus, unless one has a very vivid memory and can recall thumbs associated with pure text from a few hundred (600+) images
Mar 02 03:13:54 <John_Ivan>	Khaytsus, in fact, perfect scenario for you to imagine. imagine you were a movie casette sorter. you know most movies based on the cover you see on a carcass.
Mar 02 03:14:07 <John_Ivan>	Khaytsus, and you have 1000s to sort
Mar 02 03:14:17 <John_Ivan>	Khaytsus, text falls short. very quickly.
Mar 02 03:14:57 <John_Ivan>	and you can't be arsed to remember the title of every movie, because, well, use case - turns out most movies are CODES.
Mar 02 03:17:25 <John_Ivan>	Khaytsus, better example, imagine all your songs never had titles and only had 1 image to represent them.
Mar 02 03:17:41 <espresso>	John_Ivan: CMS worth its salt (like MODX, Drupal, and probably others) should make it child's play, and may well have community templates like that posted
Mar 02 03:17:47 <John_Ivan>	you remember them only by what they sound like, your own personal tags and what the cover looks like.
Mar 02 03:18:13 <John_Ivan>	espresso, I'll be digging around, thanks.
Mar 02 03:23:32 <Khaytsus>	John_Ivan: I dunno what a blog and images have to do with each other
Mar 02 03:23:41 <Khaytsus>	and all my music is tagged and has album art....
Mar 02 03:25:01 <espresso>	I thought the idea was to give each post an image, and it would show up in search results and make it easier to identify
Mar 02 03:38:40 <John_Ivan>	espresso, exactly.
Mar 02 03:38:51 <John_Ivan>	Khaytsus, espresso got it.
Mar 02 03:38:59 <invra>	I've been struggling to get an SSL certificate for my subdomain despite spending hours going through documentation and tweaking Cloudflare DNS records. The main domain is signed correctly, but accessing the Hestia control panel via SSL at subdomain.domain.com:8083/ throws a Chrome error: NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID. The subdomain is also signed, just when i add the port it just spits that chrome
Mar 02 03:39:01 <invra>	error.
Mar 02 03:39:13 <John_Ivan>	Khaytsus, I'm essentially trying to use tools "differently" to achieve my goal.
Mar 02 03:39:17 <Anjor>	Every week he comes heer and complains that this magical software doesn't exist.
Mar 02 03:39:39 <John_Ivan>	Anjor, every month* :)
Mar 02 03:40:00 <John_Ivan>	Anjor, because it doesn't! so I end up hacking existing tools and using them unorthodoxly to solve my issues. such is life.
Mar 02 03:40:09 <invra>	i actually made a forum post with additional information, if anyone can take a look https://forum.hestiacp.com/t/trouble-with-ssl-certificate-for-subdomain/13332
Mar 02 03:40:27 <ayecee>	invra: is the same server running on both ports?
Mar 02 03:40:48 <invra>	ayecee: what do you mean
Mar 02 03:41:28 <ayecee>	invra: you say you get the error when you add the port. it works fine on the regular ssl port?
Mar 02 03:41:38 <invra>	i think i must of have something missconfigured in cloudflare
Mar 02 03:41:45 <invra>	yes
Mar 02 03:41:57 <ayecee>	okay, so is the same program listening on each port?
Mar 02 03:42:04 <invra>	hmm
Mar 02 03:42:06 <ayecee>	or is it a different program on 8083?
Mar 02 03:42:13 <invra>	nothing else installed
Mar 02 03:42:42 <ayecee>	so, yes? no? don't know, never checked?
Mar 02 03:43:11 <ayecee>	don't know how to check?
Mar 02 03:43:19 <ayecee>	the answer is pretty ambiguous.
Mar 02 03:43:19 <John_Ivan>	Anjor, you want a semi detached vehicle with 7 wheels and all you get are 4x4s. What's a guy supposed to do?
Mar 02 03:43:25 <invra>	Also i have two triangle icons in the cloudflare dns setup that i cant get rid of; This record exposes the IP address used in the A record on ++++e.es. Enable the proxy status to protect your origin server.
Mar 02 03:43:36 <invra>	ayecee: i am not sure how to check
Mar 02 03:43:44 <Anjor>	John_Ivan: Take the train.
Mar 02 03:43:52 <ayecee>	invra: is the server running linux?
Mar 02 03:43:58 <John_Ivan>	Anjor, the train doesn't have a large enough luggage.
Mar 02 03:44:10 <Anjor>	Carry less.
Mar 02 03:44:14 <invra>	ayecee: yes, debian
Mar 02 03:45:18 <ayecee>	invra: ss -tnlp will show all the listening ports, and the program that's attached to them.
Mar 02 03:45:40 <ayecee>	use sudo.
Mar 02 03:45:58 <invra>	on the domain or subdomain?
Mar 02 03:46:04 <invra>	both im guessing
Mar 02 03:46:11 <ayecee>	... what
Mar 02 03:46:29 <invra>	nvm
Mar 02 03:46:40 <espresso>	John_Ivan: you might also check in #web (125 users). I suspect others would also suggest choosing a CMS and making or searching out a template, but maybe they could be more specific
Mar 02 03:47:46 <invra>	there is only nginx running on 8083
Mar 02 03:48:19 <ayecee>	okay so what are you connecting to when you go to port 443
Mar 02 03:49:26 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 02 03:49:27 *	litharge removes ban on *!*@149.102.244.69
Mar 02 03:49:27 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 02 03:49:29 <invra>	to a page that says success your new web server is ready to use
Mar 02 03:50:59 <invra>	ayecee: i can send you more info in private if you want to check
Mar 02 03:51:09 <invra>	i dnt want to share to the whole world here
Mar 02 03:51:26 <invra>	if needed
Mar 02 03:52:13 <ayecee>	i don't want info in private.
Mar 02 03:52:22 <invra>	oh ok then
Mar 02 03:52:52 <ayecee>	invra: it sounds like port 443 goes to a different computer.
Mar 02 03:52:56 <ayecee>	or something.
Mar 02 03:53:17 <ayecee>	so probably something to do with your cloudflare config, yeah.
Mar 02 03:53:34 <invra>	hmm that page is actually part of the control panel i use
Mar 02 03:53:46 <invra>	there is a screenshot i posted in that forum post
Mar 02 03:53:59 <invra>	i went trought dozen of documentation i have no clue what to try next
Mar 02 03:54:03 <ayecee>	if i wanted to read forum posts, i'd browse forums.
Mar 02 03:54:31 <ayecee>	here, we can talk through a problem, in a way you can't do on a forum.
Mar 02 03:54:44 <invra>	i see, i guess i can uplaod the screenshot to soem service of your choice
Mar 02 03:54:54 <eawfaw>	Any ideas why reading a file in an Ubuntu VM from a VM ware shared folder fails to open by an app, but opening it from the local disk works? (other apps seem to work fine). ls -la of both network file and local file that work show the same... Any idea what could be the difference?
Mar 02 03:54:55 <ayecee>	a direct link to the screenshot would suffice.
Mar 02 03:54:58 <invra>	ip is hidden anyways
Mar 02 03:55:26 <ayecee>	eawfaw: how are you opening it
Mar 02 03:56:26 <invra>	ayecee: https://i.ibb.co/QrGDJ39/2024-03-02-031027-793x625-scrot.png
Mar 02 03:56:26 <eawfaw>	I use an app. Same app both times
Mar 02 03:56:38 <ayecee>	eawfaw: fine. good luck.
Mar 02 03:57:32 <invra>	the subdomain is that vps entry
Mar 02 03:57:39 <invra>	with the triangle
Mar 02 03:57:47 <ayecee>	invra: this is saying that cloudflare does not handle services for those hosts.
Mar 02 03:58:22 <invra>	yueah its going straight to the IP without passing trought the cloudflare proxy, is what i understand
Mar 02 03:58:54 <ayecee>	is that what you want to happen?
Mar 02 03:59:30 <invra>	not really but it is as close as gettign ti to work i was able to get
Mar 02 03:59:38 <ayecee>	what do you want to happen?
Mar 02 04:00:14 <invra>	being able to reach the vps subdomain and sign the ssl certificate
Mar 02 04:00:24 <invra>	im so confused
Mar 02 04:00:32 <ayecee>	it's contagious.
Mar 02 04:01:11 <ayecee>	invra: if i understand you right, https://vps.domain.com works, but https://vps.domain.com:8083 gives a cert error. is that correct?
Mar 02 04:01:13 <invra>	the main domain works perfectly with ssl certificate. as soon as i added the subdomain i jsut cant figure out on how to set it up
Mar 02 04:01:36 <ayecee>	well how did you set up the main domain
Mar 02 04:02:09 <invra>	yes subdomain works with certificate as soon as i add the port its unreachable
Mar 02 04:02:27 <ayecee>	wait. unreachable?
Mar 02 04:02:35 <ayecee>	i said cert error. you said unreachable.
Mar 02 04:02:40 <invra>	well no sorry it spits that chrome error
Mar 02 04:02:41 <ayecee>	which is it?
Mar 02 04:03:10 <ayecee>	ok so that doesn't make sense. you have nothing listening on port 443, you said.
Mar 02 04:03:26 <invra>	i do
Mar 02 04:03:36 <ayecee>	what is listening on port 443
Mar 02 04:04:07 <invra>	the same thing that i see on the subdomain link
Mar 02 04:04:25 <ayecee>	how do you mean
Mar 02 04:04:36 <ayecee>	which _program_ is listening on port 443
Mar 02 04:04:40 <invra>	what i want to achieve is be able to have ssl on that link with the port 8083
Mar 02 04:05:01 <ayecee>	what link
Mar 02 04:05:43 <invra>	vps.domain.com:8083 with ssl is what i need. i do not care about vps.domain.com even being reachable at all
Mar 02 04:06:17 <invra>	on :443 i have apache
Mar 02 04:06:33 <ayecee>	on :443 you have apache, on :8083 you have nginx?
Mar 02 04:07:05 <invra>	wait le tme run that commadn again there too much info its confusing
Mar 02 04:07:29 <ayecee>	will that help? last time you ran the command, you said nothing was running on :443
Mar 02 04:08:36 <invra>	 0.0.0.0:8083    users:(("hestia-nginx"                ***.**.**.**  :443     users:(("nginx"

Mar 02 04:10:01 <ayecee>	okay. two different programs, probably using two different config files.
Mar 02 04:10:04 <Anjor>	I'm gonna hack 127.0.0.1
Mar 02 04:10:10 <ayecee>	good news, your problem is not cloudflare.
Mar 02 04:10:41 <ayecee>	bad news, you're going to have to find the config file for hestia-nginx and compare it to the :443 nginx
Mar 02 04:10:41 <invra>	so i did setup cloudflare properly? jsut those two triangles i dont know how to deal with for now
Mar 02 04:11:09 <ayecee>	invra: i don't know if you set it up properly, but i know that it's not relevant to this problem.
Mar 02 04:11:49 <invra>	i think i sent you the link to the screenshot so you can see if you want
Mar 02 04:11:55 <ayecee>	i saw it.
Mar 02 04:12:31 <ayecee>	for this problem, you're basically using cloudflare for dns hosting and nothing more.
Mar 02 04:12:41 <ayecee>	and that part is set up fine.
Mar 02 04:16:06 <invra>	oh great
Mar 02 04:20:45 <invra>	ayecee: not really sure what i am looking for
Mar 02 04:22:28 <invra>	so on 443 it seems i have the domain
Mar 02 04:22:46 <ayecee>	how do you mean
Mar 02 04:23:20 <invra>	i dont know, sorry i dont understand
Mar 02 04:23:39 <nullvalue>	morning
Mar 02 04:24:19 <ayecee>	what does it mean, "on 443 it seems i have the domain"
Mar 02 04:24:21 <scottpedia>	nullvalue: mourning
Mar 02 04:24:25 <invra>	ayecee: there is a /etc/nginx/conf.d/domains/domain.com.conf that listens to port 443
Mar 02 04:24:48 <nullvalue>	what are we mourning scott..
Mar 02 04:25:04 <ayecee>	ok so is vps.yourdomain.com in there?
Mar 02 04:26:13 <invra>	yes
Mar 02 04:26:55 <ayecee>	great. now, gotta find the configuration for the hestia-nginx server.
Mar 02 04:26:59 <invra>	but that hestia-nginx is nowhere to be found in the nginx directory. i tried to grep the whole directory and subdirectories
Mar 02 04:27:12 <ayecee>	no, it wouldn't be in there. it's a different program.
Mar 02 04:27:44 <invra>	/etc/init.d/hestia:NGINX_DAEMON=/usr/local/hestia/nginx/sbin/hestia-nginx
Mar 02 04:27:59 <ayecee>	hey, there's a lead.
Mar 02 04:28:07 <ayecee>	look under /usr/local/hestia
Mar 02 04:29:12 <invra>	/usr/local/hestia/conf/hestia.conf this seems to be the control panel configuration
Mar 02 04:30:34 <invra>	ayecee: https://hastebin.com/share/asikajoyug.bash
Mar 02 04:31:08 <ayecee>	We're sorry, but the contents of the bin could not be found, or it has been deleted.
Mar 02 04:31:45 <invra>	now? https://dpaste.com/F89MJUSFS
Mar 02 04:31:53 <ayecee>	how about you look it over and compare it to your working apache config
Mar 02 04:32:23 <ayecee>	oh hell no. time to get yourself a hestia manual.
Mar 02 04:32:48 <invra>	yeah i have been on it for the past 6 hours
Mar 02 04:32:53 <ayecee>	this config file doesn't match anything you've been talking about.
Mar 02 04:33:07 <ayecee>	i think maybe this is not the active config file.
Mar 02 04:33:39 <ayecee>	so where did you set it to use port 8083
Mar 02 04:34:20 <ayecee>	invra: no like a manual, not a forum.
Mar 02 04:34:38 <invra>	yeah thats what i jsut told you, documentation
Mar 02 04:34:54 <ayecee>	okay, which documentation are you using
Mar 02 04:34:58 <invra>	so hestia is using this famous port 8083
Mar 02 04:35:28 <invra>	the isntalaltion script for hestia panel actually usggests to use that port and the wiki
Mar 02 04:35:46 <ayecee>	do you have a link
Mar 02 04:35:54 <invra>	https://hestiacp.com/docs/introduction/getting-started.html
Mar 02 04:36:45 <invra>	there is also a demo panel where you can have a look at the webui options it has  https://demo.hestiacp.com:8083/list/user/
Mar 02 04:37:04 <ayecee>	okay. does this documentation say how to use your own cert with this program?
Mar 02 04:37:14 <invra>	at least youd have in front the same webui i have been crying on the whole night
Mar 02 04:37:25 <invra>	it autosigns
Mar 02 04:37:41 <ayecee>	so, yes? no?
Mar 02 04:37:44 <invra>	it uses lets encrypt
Mar 02 04:37:51 <ayecee>	so, yes? no?
Mar 02 04:38:19 <invra>	i am not actually using my own cert. on the main domain it automatically generated the sll certificate
Mar 02 04:38:38 <ayecee>	can you read the words that i am writing?
Mar 02 04:39:00 <invra>	yes
Mar 02 04:39:31 <ayecee>	okay. does this documentation say how to set up an ssl cert?
Mar 02 04:40:18 <invra>	if you go on the demo and click the WEB link it will take you to the website config. if you click on the website and the pencil you can see you can check the letsencrypt box and it will autosign
Mar 02 04:40:42 <ayecee>	i am asking a yes or no question.
Mar 02 04:41:30 <invra>	ye
Mar 02 04:42:06 <ayecee>	what is the link to this part of the documentation?
Mar 02 04:42:18 <invra>	https://hestiacp.com/docs/server-administration/ssl-certificates.html
Mar 02 04:42:40 <invra>	oh it signed
Mar 02 04:42:43 <ayecee>	great. have you read it?
Mar 02 04:42:46 <invra>	yeah
Mar 02 04:43:00 <ayecee>	awesome. so, let's see what it has to say.
Mar 02 04:43:19 <invra>	well yes it signed the certificate for the subdomain
Mar 02 04:43:30 <ayecee>	yeah, and it set that up great in apache.
Mar 02 04:43:43 <ayecee>	but it didn't set it up for hestia-nginx.
Mar 02 04:44:07 <invra>	https://vps.domain.com:8083/ now is ssl signed tho its not taking me to the actual control panel
Mar 02 04:44:24 <invra>	that would be waht i want4ed to achieve
Mar 02 04:45:02 <ayecee>	have you examined the cert that chrome receives
Mar 02 04:45:21 <ayecee>	do you know how
Mar 02 04:45:49 <ayecee>	(because i don't offhand)
Mar 02 04:46:22 <invra>	it says issued by lets encrypt
Mar 02 04:46:49 <invra>	if thats what you are asking me
Mar 02 04:47:14 <ayecee>	it's not
Mar 02 04:48:15 <invra>	its not what
Mar 02 04:48:26 <ayecee>	okay, looks like you go to overflow menu, then more tools, then developer tools, then click on the security tab, and then you can click on "view certificate"
Mar 02 04:48:45 <invra>	yes im viwing it
Mar 02 04:48:54 <invra>	you can click the lock on the left of the address bar
Mar 02 04:49:07 <ayecee>	with that, you can compare what you get from https://vps.yourdomain.com and https://vps.yourdomain.com:8083 and see how they're different.
Mar 02 04:49:10 <invra>	and view the certifficare
Mar 02 04:49:18 <sphertext>	guys what is happened :@ https://tildeverse.org/
Mar 02 04:49:31 <ayecee>	sphertext: what
Mar 02 04:49:44 <ayecee>	invra: i was looking for that too but my chrome doesn't have that.
Mar 02 04:49:47 <sphertext>	i think they got pwnd
Mar 02 04:49:59 <invra>	weird my chrome does
Mar 02 04:50:17 <ayecee>	sphertext: probably shouldn't click on it then.
Mar 02 04:51:48 <ayecee>	invra: ah. i get a site settings icon. i click on that, then on "connection is secure", then "certificate is valid", and then it shows the cert.
Mar 02 04:51:58 <invra>	yes that
Mar 02 04:52:08 <invra>	its a bit weird
Mar 02 04:52:14 <invra>	not so straight forward
Mar 02 04:52:17 <ayecee>	nod
Mar 02 04:52:36 <invra>	i think firefox has that a bit more self explanatory
Mar 02 04:52:43 <ayecee>	except i guess the :8083 one says certificate is invalid or something, eh?
Mar 02 04:53:04 <invra>	yeah its dead now i cant even reach it
Mar 02 04:53:19 <ayecee>	what happens when you try
Mar 02 04:53:33 <invra>	infinite loading
Mar 02 04:53:47 <ayecee>	does the :443 one still work?
Mar 02 04:54:05 <jamiahx2>	hello hello
Mar 02 04:54:20 <jamiahx2>	I'm replaying my files from a tar archive onto my new hard drive to rebuild my home partition
Mar 02 04:54:57 <jamiahx2>	one of the archives got interrupted while replaying, and I had to restart it with `--skip-old-files`
Mar 02 04:55:01 <invra>	yeah thats the main domain that workd
Mar 02 04:55:19 <invra>	works*
Mar 02 04:55:22 <jamiahx2>	but now the metadata of the directory is wrong and I can't get it to match what's in the archive
Mar 02 04:55:23 <ayecee>	invra: no, does vps.yourdomain.com:443 work
Mar 02 04:57:22 <invra>	no
Mar 02 04:57:32 <ayecee>	is your server offline
Mar 02 04:57:36 <invra>	no
Mar 02 04:57:41 <invra>	my website is up
Mar 02 04:57:52 <ayecee>	your main website is proxied through cloudflare. it doesn't count.
Mar 02 04:57:54 <invra>	jsut this stupid subdomain doesnt want to work any way i set it up
Mar 02 04:58:05 <invra>	i think i tried all the webui options by now
Mar 02 04:58:13 <ayecee>	well i guess there's nothing left to try then.
Mar 02 04:58:19 <ayecee>	pack it up boys, let's go home.
Mar 02 04:58:26 <invra>	hmm
Mar 02 04:58:47 <invra>	ok now it sback up
Mar 02 04:58:58 <invra>	443 jsut takes me to the subdomain that is now signed
Mar 02 04:59:20 <ayecee>	like it was when we started.
Mar 02 04:59:26 <invra>	yes
Mar 02 04:59:43 <ayecee>	so, in chrome, compare that cert to the one on :8083
Mar 02 05:00:51 <invra>	8083 is jsut hanging at laoding
Mar 02 05:01:31 <ayecee>	what changed?
Mar 02 05:01:44 <invra>	no idea
Mar 02 05:02:00 <invra>	allright i am giving up
Mar 02 05:02:03 <invra>	no subdomain for me
Mar 02 05:02:10 <invra>	this makes no sense
Mar 02 05:02:31 <ayecee>	it makes sense to me.
Mar 02 05:03:03 <invra>	how so
Mar 02 05:03:15 <ayecee>	the letsencrypt script gets a cert through apache and updates the apache config, but doesn't update the hestia-nginx config.
Mar 02 05:04:05 <ayecee>	it would have been nice to confirm that by comparing the certs, but now :8083 won't even load, which is a whole other problem.
Mar 02 05:05:28 <invra>	8083 loads in http with the actual server's ip. it wont load with the subdomain link
Mar 02 05:05:50 <ayecee>	did it load with the subdomain link before?
Mar 02 05:06:04 <invra>	yeah
Mar 02 05:06:12 <ayecee>	like, when we started?
Mar 02 05:06:13 <invra>	a tsome point
Mar 02 05:06:18 <invra>	yes
Mar 02 05:06:24 <ayecee>	what changed since then?
Mar 02 05:06:34 <ayecee>	did you check or uncheck some boxes?
Mar 02 05:06:44 <invra>	yeah thousands
Mar 02 05:06:49 <ayecee>	since we started?
Mar 02 05:06:53 <invra>	yes
Mar 02 05:07:20 <ayecee>	do you know how much harder that makes it for both of us to figure out the problem?
Mar 02 05:07:21 <invra>	it looks like /usr/local/hestia/ssl/ contains the certificate for the actual control panel
Mar 02 05:07:44 <ayecee>	stop the shotgun debugging, okay?
Mar 02 05:07:55 <invra>	ok
Mar 02 05:08:06 <ayecee>	understand the problem first, then make a change. if that change doesn't do what you want, undo the change.
Mar 02 05:08:32 <invra>	yes tahts waht i ahve been doing by adding and removing the subdomain only
Mar 02 05:08:37 <invra>	havent touched anything else
Mar 02 05:08:48 <ayecee>	adding and removing it from what
Mar 02 05:08:49 <buraq>	ayecee: watch the snl fix it video on youtube :)
Mar 02 05:09:07 <invra>	removing the subdomain from the WEB menu in the control panel
Mar 02 05:09:27 <jamiahx2>	is there some way I can view the metadata of files inside a tar archive without extracting?
Mar 02 05:09:35 <preach>	what metadata
Mar 02 05:09:35 <ayecee>	invra: whatever. retrace your steps, and figure out which of the thousands of boxes you checked and unchecked made it stop responding.
Mar 02 05:09:52 <jamiahx2>	like owner and perms and xattr
Mar 02 05:10:06 <ayecee>	invra: giving up also sounds like a good option.
Mar 02 05:10:19 <invra>	yeah it seems like the bes toption to be honest
Mar 02 05:10:44 <sphertext>	is python a c program?
Mar 02 05:10:47 <ayecee>	if at first you don't succeed, destroy the evidence that you tried.
Mar 02 05:11:02 <jamiahx2>	I finished a 24hr chunk of extracting from a tar archive and a bit of metadata wasn't done correctly because the process was interrupted
Mar 02 05:11:39 <preach>	did you check the manpage
Mar 02 05:11:47 <jamiahx2>	of tar? yes
Mar 02 05:11:53 <n4dir>	if at first you don't succeed, give up. - I know that version
Mar 02 05:11:59 <preach>	and?
Mar 02 05:12:08 <espresso>	sphertext: Yes, Python is primarily in C
Mar 02 05:12:10 <jamiahx2>	er, wait I checked it for extraction options, 1 sec
Mar 02 05:12:15 <ayecee>	jamiahx2: tar -tvf
Mar 02 05:12:36 <jamiahx2>	ah
Mar 02 05:12:52 <invra>	ayecee: thank you anwyays for your time
Mar 02 05:13:01 <ayecee>	:)
Mar 02 05:15:20 <jamiahx2>	crap, I never actually put Desktop's perms in the tar archive
Mar 02 05:15:38 <jamiahx2>	because I extracted from inside Desktop piecemeal
Mar 02 05:18:36 <ayecee>	hate it when that happens
Mar 02 05:23:33 <jim>	espresso, https://rustpython.github.io/
Mar 02 05:23:40 <preach>	something is wrong with my system, I cannot open any new socket connections to the internet, only the ones already established (like the one I'm talking on) still work and nothing else, not even ping to my own router
Mar 02 05:24:19 <invra>	ayecee: SOLVED
Mar 02 05:24:41 <jim>	preach, what was happening when it stopped working
Mar 02 05:24:48 <espresso>	jim: ah yes, i should have said the reference implementation, CPython, is in C. :) it's been rewritten even in python
Mar 02 05:24:49 <preach>	nothing that I know of
Mar 02 05:24:57 <preach>	and I've never had this issue before
Mar 02 05:25:11 <invra>	ayecee: in case you are curious on how i fixed it.. https://fornex.com/en/help/ssl-hestia-cp/
Mar 02 05:25:41 <preach>	there's no missing/wrong routes, no firewall rules, nothing in dmesg, no ifconfig errors
Mar 02 05:25:56 <jim>	espresso, and now also in rust
Mar 02 05:25:58 <preach>	just, all new socket connections never receive any data back
Mar 02 05:26:33 <jim>	just saying...
Mar 02 05:27:24 <jim>	preach, what happens when you try to open a new socket connection?
Mar 02 05:27:54 <espresso>	jim: various ports, a good thing(tm)
Mar 02 05:28:02 <preach>	jim: nothing is ever received
Mar 02 05:28:09 <preach>	no errors just, nothing comes back
Mar 02 05:28:39 <jim>	preach, so no errors on open?
Mar 02 05:28:52 <sphertext>	have you checked the socket path
Mar 02 05:29:00 <preach>	jim: nope
Mar 02 05:31:08 <jim>	preach, what about the machine's direct connection to the internet? is it ethernet, wireless, or something else?
Mar 02 05:31:20 <preach>	wireless
Mar 02 05:31:42 <buraq>	preach: what do you get if you test the connection with nc -vz host port ?
Mar 02 05:32:43 <preach>	buraq: nada
Mar 02 05:33:18 <jim>	preach, another test: echo "HI, I'm being printed to stdout" | nc termbin.com 9999
Mar 02 05:34:21 <jim>	nc will print a termbin url
Mar 02 05:34:28 <preach>	um
Mar 02 05:34:40 <preach>	I don't think you understand why that would also not work
Mar 02 05:34:54 <preach>	the first thing that would happen is it will fail to contact any dns server
Mar 02 05:34:57 <buraq>	preach: how about to an existing socket?
Mar 02 05:35:09 <preach>	existing connections still work fine as I'm talking on it right now to you
Mar 02 05:35:25 <sphertext>	maybe the router i bork
Mar 02 05:35:55 <preach>	other devices still work though
Mar 02 05:36:01 <preach>	on the same router, with new connections
Mar 02 05:36:23 <buraq>	i just re-did my home network completely. got everything working again
Mar 02 05:36:50 <jim>	so then you're saying it's the dns server? or your machine's connection to a dns server, one mentioned in /etc/resolv.conf?
Mar 02 05:37:28 <jim>	can you ping any of the dns servers listed there?
Mar 02 05:37:45 <preach>	...
Mar 02 05:37:54 <preach>	I will just be repeating myself
Mar 02 05:38:17 <preach>	I'm saying no socket connections receive any data at all. this is at a lower level than any layer4 protocol like you're talking about
Mar 02 05:38:37 <preach>	doesn't matter if it's icmp,tcp,dns,etc.
Mar 02 05:38:43 <preach>	nothing will receive any data from anywhere
Mar 02 05:38:58 <preach>	yet somehow existing tcp connections are still working fine
Mar 02 05:40:04 <jim>	preach, you said: "<preach> the first thing that would happen is it will fail to contact any dns server", so let's explore that... because if it's not contacting any dns server, that sounds like why it's failing
Mar 02 05:40:37 <preach>	no, you simply don't understand what a socket is
Mar 02 05:40:40 <jim>	existing tcp connections were already established
Mar 02 05:40:56 <sphertext>	is there a way you could try to recreate any of the existing connections that still work, from scratch?
Mar 02 05:41:06 <preach>	I have tried about 5000 times
Mar 02 05:42:57 <preach>	but when you can't even ping the router itself, or anything, then this is not a dns or tcp or anything problem
Mar 02 05:43:06 <preach>	it's a lower level issue
Mar 02 05:43:30 <sphertext>	have you tried using a different user?
Mar 02 05:43:35 <preach>	yes
Mar 02 05:43:52 <jim>	you're probably right, but you're also saying your sockets or the opening of those sockets, are not contacting any dns servers... if you know, why are the connections not contacting any dns? (and for that matter, why would they try to contact a dns not in resolv.conf)
Mar 02 05:44:36 <preach>	you need to stop thinking about dns or layer4 at all, that is not the issue as it cannot even get that far
Mar 02 05:44:48 <jim>	but you're right, I have no experience with sockets, and I'd want to test things outside the realm of sockets (example: ping)
Mar 02 05:44:52 <preach>	no matter what protocol is attempted, nothing is ever received
Mar 02 05:45:03 <preach>	as I said, I cannot ping anything
Mar 02 05:45:04 <sphertext>	but is anything sent?
Mar 02 05:45:04 <preach>	period
Mar 02 05:45:09 <preach>	sphertext: yes according to tcpdump
Mar 02 05:45:19 <sphertext>	but is it received by the remote peer?
Mar 02 05:45:27 <jim>	so is that true for ping?
Mar 02 05:45:36 <preach>	omg
Mar 02 05:45:37 <preach>	yes.
Mar 02 05:46:08 <jim>	and you also (for example) cannot contact any web sites?
Mar 02 05:46:28 <sphertext>	you could try to mitm between the computer and the router with arp spoof and see if anything actually leaves your computer
Mar 02 05:46:44 <jim>	what you're describing does not sound like it's only about sockets
Mar 02 05:47:06 <sphertext>	try to narrow down where the connection fails
Mar 02 05:47:06 <louipc>	howd u do dat
Mar 02 05:47:21 <preach>	jim: no I cannot contact any websites. sockets are lower level than any tcp or any other protocol, like I said the protocol I use does not matter, none of them work
Mar 02 05:47:28 <preach>	sphertext: yes, and a reply is sent by the remote
Mar 02 05:47:42 <louipc>	is it plugged in
Mar 02 05:47:48 <sphertext>	ahh so stuff does leave your computer and reach the router
Mar 02 05:47:49 <akoana>	preach: so not even   ping 127.0.0.1  works?
Mar 02 05:48:02 <louipc>	oh cool
Mar 02 05:48:02 <sphertext>	it's the incoming part that fails
Mar 02 05:48:25 <louipc>	or the router outgoing part
Mar 02 05:48:32 <preach>	akoana: yes localhost works of course, but nothing that leaves the wireless interface comes back, unless it's from an already established connection
Mar 02 05:48:32 <louipc>	oh wait nvm
Mar 02 05:48:40 <akoana>	preach: ok
Mar 02 05:49:10 <sphertext>	can you ping your machine from another LAN ip?
Mar 02 05:49:17 <jim>	so IP networking (no dns) seems to work, since they were already established... can you establish any new connections?
Mar 02 05:49:29 <sphertext>	so you have any open ports on your machine you can connect to from a remote peer?
Mar 02 05:49:50 <ayecee>	let's wait for an answer before asking the next question
Mar 02 05:49:53 <preach>	it magically just started working again
Mar 02 05:49:55 <preach>	I literally did nothing
Mar 02 05:49:58 <louipc>	sweet
Mar 02 05:50:03 <superkuh>	Computers!
Mar 02 05:50:14 <louipc>	thank you cosmic rays
Mar 02 05:50:39 <sphertext>	i heard there's little tiny dwarves that sabotage you sometimes
Mar 02 05:50:55 <jim>	then it's possible someone fixed somethign... can you describe your network? do you have a WAP?
Mar 02 05:51:06 <sphertext>	the song?
Mar 02 05:51:09 <ayecee>	what's a WAP
Mar 02 05:51:27 <louipc>	wireless access point
Mar 02 05:51:35 <ayecee>	i see
Mar 02 05:51:39 <louipc>	or wet ass pussy
Mar 02 05:52:00 <sphertext>	yeah confusing
Mar 02 05:52:03 <buraq>	damn
Mar 02 05:52:17 <ayecee>	funnier when you just hint that.
Mar 02 05:52:29 <jim>	yeah don't say those kinds of things, will get you frowmned upon, or banned
Mar 02 05:52:40 <ayecee>	beware the frown!
Mar 02 05:52:47 <preach>	and now it's broken again
Mar 02 05:52:51 <buraq>	i don't see them banned
Mar 02 05:52:55 <sphertext>	ban cardi b then
Mar 02 05:53:03 <ayecee>	way ahead of you man
Mar 02 05:53:10 <preach>	but I can ping other machines on the wifi lan
Mar 02 05:53:17 <preach>	just nothing from the router onwards
Mar 02 05:53:22 <n4dir>	if you'd see people getting banned which didn't get banned it probably is time for the meds
Mar 02 05:53:23 <jim>	buraq, do I need to do it to prove it can be done?
Mar 02 05:53:32 <preach>	louipc: language
Mar 02 05:53:34 <louipc>	i gaze sternly upon you
Mar 02 05:53:39 <ayecee>	wow they  have meds for everything now
Mar 02 05:53:48 <buraq>	preach: just do what you did before, nothing :)
Mar 02 05:53:48 <preach>	yea I've been banned for way less
Mar 02 05:53:52 <n4dir>	ayecee: amazing, isn't it. usually a beer does though
Mar 02 05:53:53 <louipc>	preach: français?
Mar 02 05:53:58 <preach>	english
Mar 02 05:54:29 <n4dir>	speaking of beer, where is our master?
Mar 02 05:55:04 <ayecee>	probably having a beer
Mar 02 05:55:05 <jim>	we know all kinds of people come here, and we would like this place to be a safe place to be... when you say those kinds of things, this place -immediately- becomes unsafe
Mar 02 05:55:26 <TheRoyalWe>	especially when people are treated differently...
Mar 02 05:55:42 <buraq>	who is the master?
Mar 02 05:55:50 <ayecee>	the one with the beer i guess
Mar 02 05:55:52 <louipc>	jim: its a well known pop song
Mar 02 05:55:56 <jim>	faster master?
Mar 02 05:56:04 <buraq>	thr key holder
Mar 02 05:56:06 <preach>	thank you captain obvious
Mar 02 05:56:08 <sphertext>	that means youtube very unsafe place. unsafer than a libera channel
Mar 02 05:56:28 <ayecee>	i mean yeah. have you seen the stuff on youtube?
Mar 02 05:56:33 <louipc>	i wonder if its played on fm radio
Mar 02 05:56:38 <preach>	not all libera channels are (arbitrarily) squeaky clean like this one
Mar 02 05:56:41 <louipc>	probly
Mar 02 05:56:43 <preach>	but many of the large ones are.
Mar 02 05:56:43 <buraq>	sphertext: you get good laughs at youtube
Mar 02 05:56:44 <n4dir>	buraq: if you don't know our master, you are not ready for him yet
Mar 02 05:56:55 <jim>	preach, do you have a wap?
Mar 02 05:57:00 <sphertext>	rude
Mar 02 05:57:03 <ayecee>	that's kind of a personal question
Mar 02 05:57:04 <preach>	ban
Mar 02 05:57:17 *	sphertext feels unsafe
Mar 02 05:57:24 <TheRoyalWe>	popcorn time
Mar 02 05:57:30 <preach>	wee
Mar 02 05:57:39 <preach>	macaroni in a pot
Mar 02 05:57:55 <louipc>	is popcorn time still working
Mar 02 05:58:08 <preach>	no piracy discussion plzkthx
Mar 02 05:58:10 <ayecee>	it is on my timesheet
Mar 02 05:58:16 <n4dir>	macaroni is a myth. it doesn't really exist.
Mar 02 05:58:21 <preach>	woosh
Mar 02 05:58:23 <buraq>	weeeeeeeeeee was a funny meme back in time
Mar 02 05:58:24 <ayecee>	no no that's birds
Mar 02 05:58:43 <preach>	ur a funny meme
Mar 02 05:58:51 <n4dir>	last thing i understood was DNS, but then: i don't really understand DNS
Mar 02 05:58:57 <TheRoyalWe>	jim was right, it's going downhill fast
Mar 02 05:59:11 <preach>	kek
Mar 02 05:59:24 <louipc>	n4dir: dns is like a google that you type some words, then you get some numbers back
Mar 02 05:59:37 <sphertext>	preach i think the folks in #networking could help troubleshoot it step by step along the whole stack
Mar 02 05:59:40 <ayecee>	or like an ldap
Mar 02 05:59:51 <louipc>	wtf is a ldap
Mar 02 05:59:51 <n4dir>	louipc: yeah, something like that. The magic behind typing
Mar 02 05:59:54 <jim>	yeah. it would be nice if this channel were actually useful
Mar 02 06:00:02 <preach>	pretty sure they would just say bad hardware or buggy kernel
Mar 02 06:00:04 <buraq>	i agree
Mar 02 06:00:14 <ayecee>	it's a protocol for accessing lightweight directories
Mar 02 06:00:30 <n4dir>	ldap is like ladspa but better
Mar 02 06:00:31 <jim>	I'm trying to help people, and all I get back is noise
Mar 02 06:00:42 <buraq>	all that offtopic. isn't there another channel for that?
Mar 02 06:00:43 <preach>	jim: most people never get their questions answered, people just start telling them they're asking the wrong question, or worse
Mar 02 06:01:01 *	n4dir acts as requested by jim , recommends others to do the same. has no influnece
Mar 02 06:01:15 <louipc>	dns is basically like the phone book of the internet
Mar 02 06:01:29 <louipc>	if anyone remembers phone books
Mar 02 06:01:30 <preach>	you say that like you know what you're talking about
Mar 02 06:01:34 <preach>	you don't even know what ldap is
Mar 02 06:01:39 <preach>	/s
Mar 02 06:01:56 <buraq>	louipc: ask gen z what's a phone book, lol
Mar 02 06:02:06 <louipc>	where is he
Mar 02 06:02:07 <preach>	what's that save icon supposed to be
Mar 02 06:02:11 <preach>	looks like a vending machine
Mar 02 06:02:28 <preach>	(actual words I witnessed)
Mar 02 06:02:41 <jim>	and I'm not presently doing an authoritarian thing, and banning everyone making noise... I already asked whether I should do so simply to prove I can, but I'm not going to do that. we should all volunteer to cooperate and make the channel better
Mar 02 06:02:58 <preach>	jim: ok, mods first
Mar 02 06:03:09 <TheRoyalWe>	ZING
Mar 02 06:03:13 <louipc>	ok i agree lets ban all offtopic
Mar 02 06:03:14 <ayecee>	oh snap.
Mar 02 06:03:29 <buraq>	that's a good rule
Mar 02 06:03:41 <preach>	I love linux
Mar 02 06:03:51 <ayecee>	and linux loves you
Mar 02 06:03:53 <Kani>	nerd
Mar 02 06:03:54 <ayecee>	often
Mar 02 06:03:56 <louipc>	linux is behind the times
Mar 02 06:04:04 <buraq>	i love them juicy kernels
Mar 02 06:04:08 <preach>	Kani: that's against the channel rules you are hereby banned
Mar 02 06:04:12 <louipc>	but i still can't be bothered to use much else
Mar 02 06:04:12 <superkuh>	Which means it's better. Computing software has only become worse since 2010.
Mar 02 06:04:26 <louipc>	superkuh: not necessarily
Mar 02 06:04:28 <preach>	2007 was the year the internet went to poop
Mar 02 06:04:32 <superkuh>	Generally.
Mar 02 06:04:37 <ayecee>	don't take the cynic bait.
Mar 02 06:04:43 <preach>	that's also coincidentally when facebook opened to everyone
Mar 02 06:04:45 <louipc>	linux is behind the times on the good things that have developed in software
Mar 02 06:04:46 <buraq>	preach: facebook?
Mar 02 06:04:46 <preach>	and vista was released
Mar 02 06:04:49 <superkuh>	I'm serious, old linux distros are preferable.
Mar 02 06:04:50 <n4dir>	doesn't look as if back to ontopic question would work.
Mar 02 06:04:58 <louipc>	like greater modularity, greater security features
Mar 02 06:05:01 <Kani>	dinosaur
Mar 02 06:05:08 <n4dir>	superkuh: try dragora, probably from 2013
Mar 02 06:05:16 <ayecee>	superkuh: that's what makes it so silly
Mar 02 06:05:20 <jim>	no, that's too authoritarian and too brutal, I'm trying to help someone, and others are too... please everyone, yield to that traffic
Mar 02 06:05:28 <louipc>	for example kernel modules only work for a specific kernel
Mar 02 06:05:31 <louipc>	they are not portable
Mar 02 06:05:43 <preach>	portable module api when
Mar 02 06:05:57 <sphertext>	i think there's a slow migration back to the classical period of internet/computing
Mar 02 06:06:04 <preach>	jim: who are you trying to help
Mar 02 06:06:09 <sphertext>	the lost sons and daughters are coming home
Mar 02 06:06:15 <ayecee>	i think you're in a tiny echo chamber.
Mar 02 06:06:23 <louipc>	what like steam powered computers?
Mar 02 06:06:31 <louipc>	for making textiles
Mar 02 06:06:51 <jim>	preach, I was trying to help you, or get someone who could help you if I can't (which is probably the case)
Mar 02 06:06:59 <preach>	ah
Mar 02 06:07:02 <louipc>	why is "textiles" only 1 letter away from "textfiles"
Mar 02 06:07:10 <buraq>	even the linux ecosystem is going the wrong way
Mar 02 06:07:11 <preach>	well, it probably IS either bad hardware or kernel bug
Mar 02 06:07:33 <louipc>	buraq: which part of it? fragmentation?
Mar 02 06:07:52 <ayecee>	buraq's increasing age.
Mar 02 06:07:54 <preach>	and packaging
Mar 02 06:07:58 <jim>	ok, for kernel bug, when was the last time you ran a kernel other than the one you're running now?
Mar 02 06:08:06 <louipc>	yea maybe you got a wire loose and just randomly clicks on and off
Mar 02 06:08:09 <preach>	probably never
Mar 02 06:08:11 <buraq>	louipc: for example how fedora is removing xorg (no hate)
Mar 02 06:08:22 <louipc>	buraq: i think that's a good direction
Mar 02 06:08:26 <preach>	I only installed the OS a couple months ago
Mar 02 06:08:28 <buraq>	ayecee: don't cry little boy
Mar 02 06:08:32 <preach>	ban
Mar 02 06:08:35 <louipc>	xorg is being deprecated by its own devs
Mar 02 06:08:39 <louipc>	they are moving to wayland
Mar 02 06:08:50 <preach>	wayland is a joke *runs*
Mar 02 06:08:54 <buraq>	louipc: is ubuntu doing it? no
Mar 02 06:08:59 <ayecee>	yeah but where's the punchline
Mar 02 06:09:05 <louipc>	ubuntu lags
Mar 02 06:09:05 <louipc>	fedora innovates
Mar 02 06:09:08 <superkuh>	The punchline is there is no wayland. Only waylands.
Mar 02 06:09:15 <ayecee>	i don't get it
Mar 02 06:09:20 <jim>	preach, really? I thought I've seen you here long before that?
Mar 02 06:09:21 <n4dir>	preach: which distro? this way that way you could try a  live-iso
Mar 02 06:09:22 <preach>	the punchline is it can't even do simple things
Mar 02 06:09:34 <buraq>	and waypipes because internet is a series of pipes
Mar 02 06:09:39 <louipc>	wayland can do pretty crazy things
Mar 02 06:09:44 <louipc>	have you ever used it?
Mar 02 06:09:49 <n4dir>	all i want is windows, no crazy things
Mar 02 06:09:52 <preach>	attempted to, yes
Mar 02 06:09:53 <preach>	many times
Mar 02 06:09:54 <superkuh>	For example, there's no reference wayland way to do keyboard or mouse sharing. So many waylands chose to use libei. But sway, almost a reference in itself, refuses and refuses to implement the functionality natively.
Mar 02 06:10:07 <louipc>	attempted... sounds like you haven't really
Mar 02 06:10:13 <preach>	hot take
Mar 02 06:10:16 <n4dir>	the great thing about wayland is i can get rid of pretty any tool i use
Mar 02 06:10:17 <louipc>	you can have windows of any shape for example
Mar 02 06:10:18 <preach>	or it's just busted
Mar 02 06:10:26 <preach>	n4dir: lol
Mar 02 06:10:28 <louipc>	and dynamically rotate them to any orientation
Mar 02 06:10:37 <ayecee>	something i've always wanted to do
Mar 02 06:10:46 <louipc>	it'll make touchscreen stuff so much more intuitive
Mar 02 06:11:10 <n4dir>	what the heck is a window of any shape?
Mar 02 06:11:17 <buraq>	louipc: can you now position a window at exact co-ordinates in wayland?
Mar 02 06:11:20 <louipc>	sure a lot of things need work
Mar 02 06:11:30 <jim>	preach, ok, anyway, so no other kernels ever?
Mar 02 06:11:35 <preach>	no
Mar 02 06:11:42 <n4dir>	preach: which distro?
Mar 02 06:11:48 <louipc>	buraq: lol i dunno. i would assume so?
Mar 02 06:11:50 <preach>	ubuntu
Mar 02 06:11:59 <jim>	can you show what it says when you run: uname -r
Mar 02 06:12:13 <preach>	6.5.0-21-generic
Mar 02 06:12:28 <louipc>	n4dir: like triangles, circles, or anything.
Mar 02 06:12:44 <n4dir>	i think i'd go for a window in a line shape then
Mar 02 06:12:54 <Kani>	clicking circles
Mar 02 06:12:59 <louipc>	weird
Mar 02 06:13:35 <eawfaw>	I want to keep the history of changes of some binary files... Is there something better than Git (which is meant for text files mostly)?
Mar 02 06:13:41 <preach>	wayland devs when you ask for a standard feature available literally everywhere else: "There are no fractional pixels! Show me your monitor with fractional pixels! You can't point out flaws in the project if you're not a maintainer!"
Mar 02 06:13:57 <jim>	preach, which is the version of the kernel you're running
Mar 02 06:14:30 <preach>	and wayland can't even remap keys to other ones

Mar 02 06:18:00 <akoana>	🛑
Mar 02 06:18:03 <louipc>	buraq: oh can "apps" do it. lol yea i wouldn't assume that
Mar 02 06:18:03 <buraq>	Khaytsus: you have movies as files?
Mar 02 06:18:24 <ayecee>	i store mine as symlinks
Mar 02 06:18:25 <louipc>	but i'd assume wayland can do it
Mar 02 06:18:31 <preach>	did you know there are stop signs that don't say STOP
Mar 02 06:18:37 <preach>	even in burgerland
Mar 02 06:18:48 <buraq>	louipc: you'd assume wrong if that hasn't been fixed
Mar 02 06:18:48 <louipc>	why would you allow any random app to do wtf it wants
Mar 02 06:18:54 <ayecee>	i don't know where burgerland is but now i wanna go
Mar 02 06:18:57 <preach>	louipc: that's called the linux desktop
Mar 02 06:18:59 <n4dir>	you stop in the name of love? or just regular stopping?
Mar 02 06:19:14 <preach>	with its sorry excuse for security compared to android
Mar 02 06:19:23 <n4dir>	ayecee: burgenland sure exists. probably france or such, might be austria too, not sure
Mar 02 06:19:25 <louipc>	buraq: huh wayland itself should be able to position where it wants. apps are another story
Mar 02 06:19:41 <louipc>	buraq: you get what i'm saying?
Mar 02 06:19:48 <akoana>	n4dir: the latter
Mar 02 06:19:55 <n4dir>	akoana: thanks.
Mar 02 06:20:02 <buraq>	louipc: yea you don't know what i'm talking about
Mar 02 06:20:09 <louipc>	preach: yea part of the rationale behind wayland is improving security
Mar 02 06:20:16 <akoana>	n4dir: it's famous for excellent wines
Mar 02 06:20:36 <n4dir>	akoana: aha. I remembered the name only
Mar 02 06:20:39 <louipc>	buraq: alritey partna
Mar 02 06:20:52 <n4dir>	are we bashing wayland? else i am out
Mar 02 06:21:00 <buraq>	louipc: you didn't know that was a problem
Mar 02 06:21:31 <louipc>	yes and no
Mar 02 06:21:36 <rascul>	i run wayland from bash
Mar 02 06:21:50 <louipc>	wayland and apps for it still needs work tho
Mar 02 06:21:55 <n4dir>	i read wasteland. not sure if related.
Mar 02 06:22:11 <rascul>	teenage wasteland
Mar 02 06:22:12 <n4dir>	bash was not involved
Mar 02 06:22:19 <buraq>	fedora has solved all the problems with wayland :)
Mar 02 06:22:53 <rascul>	i don't even wear a fedora
Mar 02 06:23:04 <preach>	no global keyboard shortcuts, broken resizing, no hardware cursor, forced composition, no fractional scaling, I could go on all day
Mar 02 06:23:10 <n4dir>	i didn't even know fedora had problems
Mar 02 06:23:15 <ayecee>	and often do!
Mar 02 06:23:16 <rascul>	99 problems
Mar 02 06:23:29 <buraq>	and wayland isn't one
Mar 02 06:23:31 <preach>	and a mod ain't one
Mar 02 06:23:41 <buraq>	chmod?
Mar 02 06:23:49 <ayecee>	right. mods are legion.
Mar 02 06:23:49 <preach>	if only

Mar 02 06:27:22 <ayecee>	do people still use slashdot?
Mar 02 06:27:25 <sphertext>	buraq a higher level of abstraction from modding

Mar 02 06:39:43 <preach>	what did you search for?

Mar 02 06:52:39 <buraq>	i am. this is a good channel
Mar 02 06:53:07 <ayecee>	and you're a good buraq.
Mar 02 06:53:54 <buraq>	i am the buraq the f'n magical creature
Mar 02 06:54:10 <ayecee>	so i've heard
Mar 02 06:54:31 <buraq>	i can even fly!
Mar 02 06:56:06 <Guest64>	hello i just tried linux and its low fps. anyone know y?
Mar 02 06:57:44 <jake_grafton>	Low FPS in what? Games? Menus? Login screen?
Mar 02 06:58:50 <jim>	I don't, no; but you could try compiling the kernel for low latency (I've heard old stories about the kernel crashing in that case)
Mar 02 06:59:43 <jake_grafton>	I don't know about kernel optimizations being the solution for what is most likely a driver problem.
Mar 02 07:00:32 <jake_grafton>	An old kernel could also be a problem, but since Guest64 JUST tried Linux, the kernel is most likely modern enough.
Mar 02 07:00:51 <ayecee>	making some awfully big leaps there.
Mar 02 07:02:04 <fairway>	you people should disable ipv4 and browser the internet
Mar 02 07:02:21 <fairway>	it's amazing how little you can do
Mar 02 07:02:21 <buraq>	why?
Mar 02 07:02:22 <buraq>	w
Mar 02 07:02:48 <jake_grafton>	Ah yes my favorite activity, browser the internet.
Mar 02 07:02:51 <buraq>	ipv6 is over 20 years old
Mar 02 07:02:56 <ayecee>	me too
Mar 02 07:03:18 <buraq>	i think wayland will be as popular
Mar 02 07:03:21 <ayecee>	but is it 25 yet? can it rent a car?
Mar 02 07:03:32 <jake_grafton>	It can vote
Mar 02 07:03:34 <buraq>	i remember it from 1996
Mar 02 07:03:57 <buraq>	they talked about it at school
Mar 02 07:04:07 <ayecee>	cool school
Mar 02 07:05:18 <jake_grafton>	What do y'all think about green beans?
Mar 02 07:05:40 <EdFletcher>	i think i'll pass
Mar 02 07:05:56 <fairway>	<buraq> ipv6 is over 20 years old   exactly
Mar 02 07:06:13 <fairway>	why is ipv4 even still being used
Mar 02 07:06:21 <fairway>	it's ridiculous
Mar 02 07:06:26 <jake_grafton>	It's commonplace
Mar 02 07:06:34 <ayecee>	it's a rhetorical question.
Mar 02 07:06:39 <fairway>	we don't still use  internet explorer and netscape navigator
Mar 02 07:06:56 <ayecee>	but come on fairway, get off the soapbox.
Mar 02 07:06:56 <EdFletcher>	maybe this? http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/ipv6mess.html
Mar 02 07:07:05 <buraq>	why? internet services would end their accessibility
Mar 02 07:07:09 <fairway>	edfletcher what is that
Mar 02 07:07:16 <ayecee>	looks like an url
Mar 02 07:07:24 <ayecee>	i think you can put it in your browser
Mar 02 07:07:28 <buraq>	you're a smart ayecee
Mar 02 07:07:33 <EdFletcher>	lol it is a url, gold star ayecee ⭐
Mar 02 07:08:44 <buraq>	ipv6 designers mis-read thr old farts' unwillingness for change
Mar 02 07:09:12 <superkuh>	There are strong pressures on things like mailservers not to switch to ipv6. It's a needless risk.
Mar 02 07:09:12 <buraq>	nat. everything.
Mar 02 07:09:23 <ayecee>	inertia, not just for mass anymore
Mar 02 07:09:28 <jake_grafton>	finally someone mentions NAT
Mar 02 07:09:47 <buraq>	if one nat doesn't fix the issue, cgnat
Mar 02 07:10:41 <ayecee>	nats all the way down
Mar 02 07:10:46 <Gamah>	debian: if i just run {logger "asdf"} where does it... go?
Mar 02 07:10:51 <jake_grafton>	Quick question, would y'all rather ssh into a server like 63.179.127.97 or 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef?
Mar 02 07:11:04 <buraq>	jake_grafton: use dns man
Mar 02 07:11:07 <Gamah>	jake_grafton: ssh user@domain.tld
Mar 02 07:11:29 <jake_grafton>	Fair enough
Mar 02 07:12:04 <fairway>	superkuh whince when ipv6 is security risk
Mar 02 07:12:33 <akoana>	Gamah: on my debian machine it goes to /var/log/messages
Mar 02 07:12:34 <buraq>	you can filter ipv6 as you can ipv4
Mar 02 07:13:00 <Gamah>	akoana: okay so it's actually proxmox... i don't have a /var/log/messages :/
Mar 02 07:13:03 <ayecee>	we have the technology
Mar 02 07:13:11 <ayecee>	proxmox has a /var/log/syslog
Mar 02 07:13:21 <Gamah>	you'd think it should....
Mar 02 07:13:36 <ayecee>	it does last time i looked
Mar 02 07:13:36 <buraq>	proxmox runs on top of debian right?
Mar 02 07:13:43 <Gamah>	alas mine does not
Mar 02 07:13:46 <jake_grafton>	Proxmox? Is someone here running a beefy server?
Mar 02 07:13:49 <Robzilla>	hi.
Mar 02 07:13:52 <ayecee>	well what do you have in /var/log
Mar 02 07:14:15 <Robzilla>	can I share my server pic?
Mar 02 07:14:22 <ayecee>	nope!
Mar 02 07:14:38 <buraq>	i want to see a beefy server
Mar 02 07:14:40 <ayecee>	only text on irc
Mar 02 07:14:57 <jake_grafton>	You CAN send a link to the picture hosted on an external site.
Mar 02 07:15:02 <ayecee>	and some of the ruder emoji
Mar 02 07:15:11 <Gamah>	ayecee: https://paste.sh/ttBPBZ0c#4puozU7pa6OVrpa0O7y6BsQQ
Mar 02 07:15:19 <buraq>	i get hot when somebody mentions a beefy server
Mar 02 07:15:34 <Gamah>	buraq: calm down it's just skylake
Mar 02 07:15:56 <ayecee>	Gamah: oh, journalctl
Mar 02 07:16:02 <Robzilla>	welllll it’s 100a I can’t use atm but I can run 3500
Mar 02 07:16:08 <Gamah>	does libera not do DCC? i feel like we could share pics on irc...
Mar 02 07:16:26 <buraq>	i've used a beefy dell server and i couldn't think straight any more
Mar 02 07:17:06 <johnjaye>	Gamah: i tried /dcc on a nonexistent nick and it gave an error.
Mar 02 07:17:09 <johnjaye>	so presumably it works
Mar 02 07:17:10 <buraq>	it has 1.5 TB of ram
Mar 02 07:17:11 <ayecee>	Gamah: that is, journalctl is the program to show the logs where your logger message ends up
Mar 02 07:17:20 <jake_grafton>	1.5 TB?!?!
Mar 02 07:17:40 <jake_grafton>	Are you in debt?
Mar 02 07:17:58 <Robzilla>	 I’m on the feet about running two scrypt ASICs or 1 SHA256
Mar 02 07:18:12 <buraq>	that's why i said beefy
Mar 02 07:18:16 <Robzilla>	 I only have about 3000 W to play with, but it’s free
Mar 02 07:18:43 <Gamah>	ayecee: so i need to figure out how to search journalctl
Mar 02 07:19:00 <ayecee>	it has a pretty good manpage
Mar 02 07:19:02 <Gamah>	buraq: i'm thinking i may need to go 512gb for the size of zfs array i want
Mar 02 07:19:07 <jake_grafton>	Y'all are wild. I only have my current beefy workstation, a RPI4B, RPI5, and an old Lenovo ThinkCentre.
Mar 02 07:19:30 <buraq>	looks like it could've been a poweredge 820 or such
Mar 02 07:19:40 <jake_grafton>	What's the power draw?
Mar 02 07:20:05 <Robzilla>	s17+ is high like 3250
Mar 02 07:20:21 <Robzilla>	but I could uclock
Mar 02 07:20:31 <jake_grafton>	How's your power bill? Is power cheap where you live?
Mar 02 07:20:46 <buraq>	Gamah: bigger is better if you know what i mean
Mar 02 07:20:53 <Robzilla>	 The last time bitcoin was this lucrative it was 12.9 cents a kilowatt hour
Mar 02 07:21:16 <Robzilla>	 Now I don’t even have power just a solar generator, a gas generator, and a DSL connection
Mar 02 07:21:33 <Gamah>	buraq: for sure... 100TB usable is a silly goal but it's one i can afford so here we are
Mar 02 07:21:33 <ayecee>	van life eh
Mar 02 07:21:43 <Robzilla>	 But to answer your question anytime my power bill was under $1700. I was very happy.
Mar 02 07:22:00 <jake_grafton>	You don't even have to pay for heating.
Mar 02 07:22:09 <Gamah>	my power bill floats around $170 in the winter when i use nat gas for heat... with the AC in the summer it can get up to $300
Mar 02 07:22:50 <Robzilla>	 At least it was winter and I didn’t have to turn on the central heat all season. Lol.
Mar 02 07:22:57 <Gamah>	average load for this new server puts me at right about $1/day in power usage, worth it
Mar 02 07:23:41 <Robzilla>	 What is the price per kilowatt hour?
Mar 02 07:24:02 <Robzilla>	 I mean they were charging us $.13 years ago
Mar 02 07:24:04 <Gamah>	much like the last one, even though it's going on 8 years old... this server's capabilities are far beyond what i could possibly imagine i would ever need to use it for
Mar 02 07:24:13 <Gamah>	Robzilla: i think 0.12-0.18/kwh
Mar 02 07:24:32 <Gamah>	let me find my password manager and actually check a bill.. one sec
Mar 02 07:25:24 <Robzilla>	 I think I would just make everything mine Dogecoin at the moment what is turned a double+ profit or so just this week
Mar 02 07:25:59 <Gamah>	ayecee: didn't get what i wanted but learned how to search journalctl, thanks! :D
Mar 02 07:26:04 <Gamah>	now i need to actually fix the logging....
Mar 02 07:26:13 <ayecee>	:)
Mar 02 07:27:13 <jake_grafton>	Gamah: You have quite a nice server, while I'm just purring along with my old ThinkCentre acting as my DNS, web server, and file server all in one. ;)
Mar 02 07:27:39 <Gamah>	jake_grafton: the mikrotik hex does most of my network stuff, hoping to eliminate that soon-ish with a vm
Mar 02 07:28:24 <jake_grafton>	What do you mean?
Mar 02 07:28:41 <Gamah>	Robzilla: am actually working on your answer for power cost but the bill is... confusing and i'm on a new machine so i need to install gimp to anonymize...
Mar 02 07:29:09 <Robzilla>	 I think I’m gonna sell four of my best acres and reroof the house with solar panels
Mar 02 07:29:34 <Robzilla>	 After roofing it in the first place, that is …
Mar 02 07:30:06 <ory>	how much is acre these days
Mar 02 07:30:18 <jake_grafton>	I've never thought about this until now but....how do you clean solar panels?
Mar 02 07:30:37 <ory>	i meant the price
Mar 02 07:31:00 <Gamah>	Robzilla: https://i.imgur.com/aogRlEU.png
Mar 02 07:31:17 <Gamah>	looks to be about 0.18-ish all in?
Mar 02 07:31:38 <Gamah>	oh wait more than that...
Mar 02 07:31:47 <mlu>	jake_grafton: with slave labor
Mar 02 07:31:50 <Gamah>	idk how to read this thing.
Mar 02 07:31:53 <mlu>	jake_grafton: or natural events
Mar 02 07:32:08 <mlu>	earthquakes, wind, rain, etc.
Mar 02 07:32:15 <Gamah>	if you divide 614kwh by the total bill it 0.187/kwh
Mar 02 07:32:15 <SpearRaven>	hey guys. what is that linux site where people post screenshots of their linux desktop, like showing off the way they have set it up?
Mar 02 07:32:19 <jake_grafton>	ory: The average price for an acre in the US in $15,232 according to landsearch.com
Mar 02 07:32:25 <Gamah>	SpearRaven: most of tem
Mar 02 07:32:27 <Gamah>	them*
Mar 02 07:32:35 <mlu>	jake_grafton: average place in the US is middle of nowhere
Mar 02 07:32:46 <jake_grafton>	mlu: Yes
Mar 02 07:32:48 <Gamah>	i wonder what an acre of california is
Mar 02 07:32:50 <SpearRaven>	I think there is a particular one, I just can't remember
Mar 02 07:33:01 <jake_grafton>	Gamah: $25,514
Mar 02 07:33:02 <mlu>	average place in the US, you can't even drive to
Mar 02 07:33:13 <Gamah>	that's actually not that bad... assuming "average" tho...
Mar 02 07:33:21 <mlu>	you'll probably just die if you make it to the average place in the US
Mar 02 07:33:22 <jake_grafton>	Welcome to Cali
Mar 02 07:33:36 <ory>	is it overpriced?
Mar 02 07:33:37 <Gamah>	i'd be really surpreised if you can buy an acre in the valley for less than multiple 6 figures
Mar 02 07:33:45 <mlu>	well, there is demand :)
Mar 02 07:33:51 <jake_grafton>	ory: Compared to the rest of the US, yes.
Mar 02 07:34:01 <Gamah>	ory: it's only overpriced if nobody buys it, welcome to free markets
Mar 02 07:34:15 <mlu>	an acre within 1hr of my whereabouts would probably be closer to $1MM
Mar 02 07:34:26 <jake_grafton>	holy balls dude
Mar 02 07:34:35 <mlu>	on the other hand, you might actually be able to get an acre for that price in rural Montana or Alaska
Mar 02 07:34:50 <mlu>	** ~$20k
Mar 02 07:35:15 <ory>	it's dirt cheap here in my third world country
Mar 02 07:35:16 <mlu>	jake_grafton: 8 acres for $100k -- but it's a 10hr drive away and only accessible in the winter
Mar 02 07:35:16 <Robzilla>	 I got to get on a PC ASAP
Mar 02 07:35:42 <mlu>	and if you get hurt, you might just bleed to death because medical services are hours away by helicopter
Mar 02 07:35:48 <mlu>	and there is no cell coverage
Mar 02 07:35:57 <jake_grafton>	mlu: I introduce to you, plane.
Mar 02 07:36:14 <mlu>	jake_grafton: nearest airport that can accept such fast planes is also that far away
Mar 02 07:36:25 <Robzilla>	 Or I would even settle with Windows XP on VMware with going old mIRC
Mar 02 07:36:32 <mlu>	at best, you'll be dealing with a bush pilot on a dirt runway with their SR-22
Mar 02 07:36:34 <Gamah>	oh mirc...
Mar 02 07:36:35 <jake_grafton>	mlu: Ender pearl there
Mar 02 07:36:40 <Gamah>	some day i want to finally get off of quassel
Mar 02 07:36:41 <n4dir>	  bleed to death, did you learn nothing from rambo?
Mar 02 07:36:43 <mlu>	jake_grafton: hehehe :)
Mar 02 07:37:10 <Gamah>	mlu: idk if you could pay me enough to sit in an sr22 intending to visit dirt
Mar 02 07:37:11 <SpearRaven>	Predator: If it bleeds, we can kill it
Mar 02 07:37:40 <mlu>	Gamah: great way to die :)
Mar 02 07:38:12 <mlu>	anyways, if you're still interested: https://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/landsales/
Mar 02 07:38:23 <mlu>	Alaska accounts for 1/5 of all the land available in the US
Mar 02 07:38:57 <mlu>	it's pretty much a cold version of the Australian outback
Mar 02 07:39:41 <jake_grafton>	Just with less roos
Mar 02 07:39:50 <mlu>	and more polar bears
Mar 02 07:40:04 <buraq>	how do you define offtopic here?
Mar 02 07:40:13 <mlu>	buraq: anything that's not about linux
Mar 02 07:40:26 <buraq>	it doesn't look that way
Mar 02 07:40:36 <mlu>	buraq: i.e. this convo we're having would be offtopic, and we'd need to yield if someone actually wants to talk about linux
Mar 02 07:40:44 <Gamah>	mlu: i can think of better ways
Mar 02 07:41:12 <jake_grafton>	mlu: Can you ride a polar bear like a horse into battle?
Mar 02 07:41:16 <Gamah>	once i realized we can't invent, produce, or print more land i realized why so many people who end up wealthy get into real estate
Mar 02 07:41:18 <buraq>	so what's the best i/o scheduler in your opinion?
Mar 02 07:41:25 <Gamah>	jake_grafton: i'd pay to wach you try
Mar 02 07:41:30 <Gamah>	buraq: mssql
Mar 02 07:41:30 <mlu>	buraq: epoll works fine IMO
Mar 02 07:41:39 <buraq>	lol mssql
Mar 02 07:41:51 <Gamah>	it's all i know, but it's pretty weird some of the shit they do...
Mar 02 07:42:00 <buraq>	mlu: i haven't seen that one earlier. is it new?
Mar 02 07:42:04 <jake_grafton>	Gamah: 50 cents and a half eaten lollipop and I'll try
Mar 02 07:42:20 <mlu>	buraq: just a way to manage I/O events in Linux -- kqueue vs epoll
Mar 02 07:43:08 <buraq>	i've just used bfq, cfq and schedutil
Mar 02 07:43:35 <buraq>	i think an earlier one was deadline
Mar 02 07:43:47 <mlu>	hmm, maybe I"m confused
Mar 02 07:45:20 <Gamah>	buraq: jake_grafton: teaser of alleged beefy server: https://i.imgur.com/7SzLxDX.png
Mar 02 07:45:46 <jake_grafton>	Gamah: It's. Perfect.
Mar 02 07:45:58 <mlu>	Gamah: how are these text display devices usually mounted / exposed via? smbus?
Mar 02 07:46:31 <Gamah>	mlu: there's probably something in /dev somewhere.. on older servers you could just echo to a tty or something. i have no clue for this one it's just a field in the ipmi webui
Mar 02 07:46:54 <Gamah>	i have a video somewhere of me doing the echo thing on a much older server somewhere....
Mar 02 07:48:14 <mlu>	if I was implementing it from scrach, I imagine I'd use an i2c to parallel memory driver to target the LCD module
Mar 02 07:48:21 <jake_grafton>	Gamah: buraq: My dusty server: https://imgur.com/a/eiMsWQx
Mar 02 07:48:33 *	Gamah whistles
Mar 02 07:48:40 <Gamah>	you can fit so many iops and flops in ther
Mar 02 07:48:44 *	mlu breaks off the wifi stick
Mar 02 07:49:02 <buraq>	Gamah: i like your butt, lol
Mar 02 07:49:25 <Gamah>	buraq: on the old server i could animate stuff https://a.uguu.se/PJAAqZbx.mp4
Mar 02 07:49:30 <mlu>	 my home workstation has over 50TFLOPs of FP16
Mar 02 07:49:42 <Gamah>	2015 was such a simpler time...
Mar 02 07:49:51 <Gamah>	i think that one is still in my basement somewhere...
Mar 02 07:50:21 <EdFletcher>	tiny little server! https://ed.discordrc.com/attachments/ohjfwKOq7BTEeE-mhkEF_.jpg
Mar 02 07:50:52 <mlu>	awww, cute hat
Mar 02 07:50:54 <Gamah>	i hope in 4-5 more years i don't think 56 skylake threads and half a TB of ram is not enough for the shit i want to run out of my house...
Mar 02 07:51:12 <Gamah>	i never thought 32 sandybridge threads with 128gb of ram would feel like not enough..
Mar 02 07:51:15 <EdFletcher>	mlu: 😊 👒
Mar 02 07:55:08 <Robzilla>	I thought I was on fire when I upgraded 386/sx 25 to 486 dx2/66mhz
Mar 02 07:55:45 <Robzilla>	or no just the dx33 was first but
Mar 02 07:56:16 <rascul>	i can't even blink that fast
Mar 02 07:56:33 <Robzilla>	 How do you explain to people nowadays that it used to take time and storage just to hold a book?
Mar 02 07:58:10 <hackinghorn>	hi
Mar 02 07:58:42 <hackinghorn>	I have this problem when I'm in terminal and not typing, my monitor randomly turns off
Mar 02 07:59:06 <Robzilla>	 So can you still jump on EF net on here?
Mar 02 07:59:08 <hackinghorn>	does not happen when I'm in other apps, like browser
Mar 02 07:59:45 <buraq>	Robzilla: not on libera
Mar 02 08:00:31 <Norkle>	:|
Mar 02 08:02:19 <hackinghorn>	ah it happens on other apps too, weird
Mar 02 08:02:37 <agent314>	heyyo
Mar 02 08:02:46 <n4dir>	my monitor even turns off while i am typing. Turn on a second after that too
Mar 02 08:03:01 <hackinghorn>	n4dir: damn, advanced power savings
Mar 02 08:03:18 <hackinghorn>	agent314: good day!
Mar 02 08:03:33 <r-zan>	When my monitor turns off, it's a gamble if it'll turn back on or if I have to just reset my PC
Mar 02 08:03:38 <n4dir>	i tend to just ignore problems, but if you find a solution, you might tell me
Mar 02 08:04:08 <agent314>	so i found my raspberry pico
Mar 02 08:04:18 <hackinghorn>	it saves power, not bad
Mar 02 08:05:04 <n4dir>	perhaps something with the planet
Mar 02 08:12:11 <agent314>	does anyone know off the top of their head the kind of shenanigans where your backspace acts as a... space (??) when sshed into a box?
Mar 02 08:13:17 <agent314>	like i'm sshed into an amazon debian 12. i'm not running tmux or screen and somehow i got the console to break in this very strange way where it's basically impossible to remove anything typed previously
Mar 02 08:15:26 <agent314>	(by amazon debian 12 i mean it's like a nano or something running Debian 12 on EC2, nothing to do with Amazon's linux)
Mar 02 08:15:30 <Gamah>	hackinghorn: i have had terrible luck with gsync monitors doing that when gsync or adaptivesync or whatevertheshit the foss version is called are enabled
Mar 02 08:15:40 <Gamah>	(issues with all of them, independently)
Mar 02 08:21:40 <karthy>	Does the kernel have ASLR
Mar 02 08:22:01 <agent314>	actually it's something to do with alacritty. I just disconnected from EC2. Reconnecting from alacritty -- terminal broken. Terminator -- perfectly fine. Koonsole -- works. QTerminal -- works. Kitty -- broken.
Mar 02 08:22:02 <Gamah>	if not, does it have ASMR?
Mar 02 08:22:26 <karthy>	Lmao
Mar 02 08:22:32 <Gamah>	karthy: i think the cpu does that these days...but i could be wrong
Mar 02 08:23:14 <Gamah>	hm, seems it is in the kernel
Mar 02 08:23:21 <Gamah>	but i'm like 99% sure modern memory controllers also do it
Mar 02 08:23:25 <karthy>	PS4 kernel didn’t have ASLR but it was BSD tho
Mar 02 08:23:54 <Gamah>	it would make sense that a non critical system likea game console might have it off to help developers create and debug shovelwa--games more quickly
Mar 02 08:24:27 <Gamah>	the ps4 is also over a decade old and it's development is probably 3-4 years older than that
Mar 02 08:24:51 <karthy>	I know I am just telling
Mar 02 08:27:17 <agent314_>	btw you can check if ASLR is activated via this
Mar 02 08:27:19 <agent314_>	cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
Mar 02 08:27:58 <Gamah>	idk what the acronym is but way before the kernel ever loads your cpu also initializes the ram with something that is not a linear mapping between the address bits and the physical location of those bits on the dimm
Mar 02 08:28:13 <Gamah>	though... if you're a malicious piece of software you are not affected by that i suppose
Mar 02 08:28:28 <karthy>	Interest
Mar 02 08:28:37 <karthy>	Interesting
Mar 02 08:28:58 <agent314_>	Gamah: i think in modern cpus there's silicon to deal with stuff like that or am i severely out of my element?
Mar 02 08:29:33 <Gamah>	agent314_: yeah... like if you could freeze ram and read it after taking it out of a machine, unless you can get the mapping out of the CPU too you wouldn't be able to make much sense out of what's in memory
Mar 02 08:29:35 <Gamah>	i think...
Mar 02 08:30:03 <karthy>	So cold boot attack left the chat then
Mar 02 08:30:16 <agent314_>	Gamah: are we talking about virtual memory?
Mar 02 08:30:16 <Gamah>	definitely during the 2020s
Mar 02 08:30:20 <Gamah>	2010's*
Mar 02 08:30:27 <Gamah>	agent314_: i don't think i am
Mar 02 08:30:58 <r-zan>	Dumb question : If so many distros are based off of either debian, or based off of ubuntu which is based off of debian...what is stopping me from taking my debian install and literally turning it into say... LMDE?
Mar 02 08:31:11 <r-zan>	Outside of just a massive amount of legwork
Mar 02 08:31:11 <Gamah>	karthy: the feds went really far out of their way to make sure they could get ross ulbright's laptop before he could put it to sleep/hibernate/whatever in 2013 because they knew unless it was logged in they wouldn't get anything useful from the machine
Mar 02 08:31:31 <Gamah>	r-zan: idk what lmde is
Mar 02 08:31:33 <agent314_>	i think they just staged a fight
Mar 02 08:31:42 <Gamah>	agent314_: yup
Mar 02 08:31:57 <r-zan>	LMDE = Linux Mint Debian Edition
Mar 02 08:32:15 <agent314_>	i heard of a system somewhere where there's a flash drive or something USB-appendaged tied to your hand and shoved into the laptop
Mar 02 08:32:18 <Gamah>	agent314_: also the warrant wasn't for the library... but politics on irc is a risque topic
Mar 02 08:32:34 <n4dir>	 r-zan: pretty sure there is kind of a package to make debian LMDE like, probably themes and such
Mar 02 08:33:01 <n4dir>	r-zan: in general nothing is stopping you, and it isn't as much work as you think
Mar 02 08:33:04 <Gamah>	r-zan: there's nothing stoping you from doing that but you could also probably just install gnome2 on debian and find ubuntu's theming
Mar 02 08:33:39 <Gamah>	the problem for most distros like that is getting people to notice or care, leaving their maintainers feeling like they wasted their time
Mar 02 08:33:56 <Gamah>	but you've touched on the best part of linux, you can do whatever you want and nobody can stop you :)
Mar 02 08:34:00 <r-zan>	So essentially, say if I just wanted to change my debian install into ubunti. Just swap some apt repos around, install snap, make it look like ubuntu and add all the default apps....then bam. It's ubuntu just with a broken neofetch?
Mar 02 08:34:18 <agent314_>	Gamah: yeah i'd be more comfortable discussing stuff like fbi in  linux-offtopic, my wounds from  horrific op brutality are still fresh :)
Mar 02 08:34:19 <n4dir>	nope, that won't work, r-zan
Mar 02 08:34:25 <Gamah>	you could even upstream a patch to neofetch to recognize your r-zanOS
Mar 02 08:34:31 <n4dir>	you can't just mix and change debian and ubuntu repos
Mar 02 08:34:54 <Gamah>	n4dir: you can if you want to be a maintainer lol
Mar 02 08:35:03 <Gamah>	like apt isn't going to stop you...
Mar 02 08:35:11 <r-zan>	I kinda gathered. I wasn't really meaning like just making it look like another distro
Mar 02 08:35:24 <n4dir>	no. adding debian repos to ubuntu or ubuntu repos to debian will not work
Mar 02 08:35:47 <Gamah>	r-zan: i think the disconnect is that you think mint is somehow special or bespoke to ubuntu when it's really just gnome2 with a theme, which you can probably copy/paste to debian
Mar 02 08:35:52 <r-zan>	Thats easy. But rather what would stop me from literally turning my debian install INTO essentially ubuntu... or a little more than just a crude mockery
Mar 02 08:35:53 <agent314_>	so, just finishing up what i said -- i forgot what exactly the system but essentially as soon as there was  a flash drive disconnect it would overwrite ram a couple of times and shutdown into encrypted state
Mar 02 08:35:56 <karthy>	What’s the difference Debian and Ubuntu
Mar 02 08:36:14 <agent314_>	karthy: from what I heard lately one of the differences is snap
Mar 02 08:36:25 <Gamah>	r-zan: unless you're pulling from the ubuntu repos then it's still debian. even if you take gnome2 and the mint theme and make it look like ubuntu mint on the surface
Mar 02 08:36:42 <Gamah>	agent314_: it was a key chord i think not a usb device
Mar 02 08:36:56 <karthy>	Fun fact Debian was named after Debra and Ian
Mar 02 08:37:13 <n4dir>	r-zan: what will stop you is that it won't work
Mar 02 08:37:26 <Gamah>	karthy: living in the last 1-3 years vs the last 5-8 years is the difference usually
Mar 02 08:37:42 <agent314_>	Gamah: yeah i wish i could remember where i read about that thing, might have been IVPN's extensive, way-too-overkill-for-a-vpn-opsec-article-series
Mar 02 08:38:00 <Gamah>	agent314_: american kingpin is a great non-fiction book that reads like a novel
Mar 02 08:38:01 <agent314_>	or maybe phrack or PoCorgtfo
Mar 02 08:38:36 <agent314_>	so what would be reasons that would make somebody choose ubuntu over debian?
Mar 02 08:38:52 <r-zan>	Well, good to know before I poured a bunch of hours trying to cobble something awful together then going "Dammit, Time to reinstall AGAIN"
Mar 02 08:38:59 <Gamah>	LTS that gets fairly frequent and meaningful updates
Mar 02 08:39:07 <Gamah>	r-zan: i think you just want debian with gnome2
Mar 02 08:39:14 <Gamah>	if you care about debian for some reason
Mar 02 08:39:19 <n4dir>	agent314_: you migth want to listen to "who the bloody hell cares about debian".
Mar 02 08:39:31 <r-zan>	Nah, more just a curiosity sorta thing
Mar 02 08:39:41 <Gamah>	i'm not sure what n4dir means by "it won't work"
Mar 02 08:39:46 <agent314_>	n4dir: from opensuse?
Mar 02 08:39:46 <n4dir>	there are things about debian, and things about ubuntu, which are a different approach
Mar 02 08:39:53 <Gamah>	n4dir: name 3
Mar 02 08:39:56 <n4dir>	agent314_: not from opensuse
Mar 02 08:40:03 <Gamah>	besides snap, because i don't even use snap on ubuntu lol
Mar 02 08:40:05 <agent314_>	Stefano Zacchiroli?
Mar 02 08:40:09 <n4dir>	agent314_: yup
Mar 02 08:40:23 <agent314_>	https://upsilon.cc/~zack/talks/2011/20110206-fosdem.pdf
Mar 02 08:40:43 <agent314_>	ok there's two youtube videos though
Mar 02 08:40:44 <n4dir>	1) debian is a community distro 2) debian has no real focus on look-and-feel 3) debian has a different release cycle
Mar 02 08:41:08 <agent314_>	one 22:29 from opensuse, one 45:32 from linux.conf.au 2011
Mar 02 08:41:17 <n4dir>	agent314_: at forums.debian.net "who is a real debian user" is also not too bad (by rickh)
Mar 02 08:41:29 <agent314_>	judging by your "not from opensuse" i'm gonna guess it's the 45:32 one
Mar 02 08:41:53 <agent314_>	alternatively i could just watch both of them
Mar 02 08:42:02 <Gamah>	n4dir: but what's stopping you from using debian repos on a ubuntu install or visa versa? what "doesn't work"?
Mar 02 08:42:12 <n4dir>	debian users tend to be a bit more minimal too. not too strict focus on usability or comfort, but rather on minimalism
Mar 02 08:42:14 <agent314_>	Gamah: i've done stuff like that
Mar 02 08:42:20 <n4dir>	has changed a bit
Mar 02 08:42:24 <n4dir>	Gamah: it will break the installation
Mar 02 08:42:28 <agent314_>	i've shoved debian repos into kali
Mar 02 08:42:40 <n4dir>	kali is based on debian, as far i know
Mar 02 08:42:45 <Gamah>	i bet you could transition one to the other with enough effort
Mar 02 08:42:48 <Gamah>	if you cared..
Mar 02 08:42:48 <agent314_>	same with ubuntu
Mar 02 08:43:02 <n4dir>	Gamah: with enough effort? Like half a year? perhaps
Mar 02 08:43:13 <agent314_>	half a year?
Mar 02 08:43:19 <Gamah>	if i was building an embedded system to run on a missile or figher jet or something i'd probably go with debian... if i was buliding something for a regular "computer" that regular humans interact with probably ubuntu
Mar 02 08:43:32 <Gamah>	n4dir: never underestimate someone on irc's drive to prove you wrong
Mar 02 08:43:36 <karthy>	Guys guys is Debian and Ubuntu difference please
Mar 02 08:43:42 <n4dir>	go for it if you want to
Mar 02 08:43:44 <agent314_>	Gamah: if you were doin something like that you'd want a real time os
Mar 02 08:43:52 <Gamah>	so he admits it's possible... sounds like "could work" to me
Mar 02 08:43:59 <n4dir>	i didn't admit anything
Mar 02 08:44:03 <Gamah>	agent314_: i mean spacex runs c# on their rockets...
Mar 02 08:44:30 <Artfaith>	karthy, Ubuntu is based on Debian.
Mar 02 08:44:35 <Artfaith>	The difference.
Mar 02 08:44:36 <agent314_>	probably FreeRTOS with a heavy dose of FPGAs
Mar 02 08:44:52 <Gamah>	karthy: ubuntu will sell you support and an SLA, debian will not
Mar 02 08:45:39 <n4dir>	i could sell you support
Mar 02 08:45:45 <Gamah>	but you are not debian
Mar 02 08:45:50 <n4dir>	i am not
Mar 02 08:45:53 <agent314_>	even with network switches that's similar to how Cisco architects its devices
Mar 02 08:45:54 <Gamah>	so you see what i mean
Mar 02 08:46:31 <agent314_>	custom lean operating system + everything that could be turned into an ASIC has been turned into an ASIC
Mar 02 08:46:41 <Gamah>	is cisco hardware really running a realtime os? i would have assumed it was all x86 or arm
Mar 02 08:46:55 <agent314_>	Gamah: not exactly
Mar 02 08:47:00 <Gamah>	i worded that poorly
Mar 02 08:47:10 <Gamah>	i assumed it was all generic bsd/linux/etc
Mar 02 08:47:18 <agent314_>	but it's fairly close
Mar 02 08:47:21 <Gamah>	they offload so much to the network hardware
Mar 02 08:47:25 <Gamah>	like most switches
Mar 02 08:47:44 <agent314_>	Gamah: for the most part of history they were running IOS -- not to be confused with iOS
Mar 02 08:47:53 <Gamah>	i only know routeros
Mar 02 08:47:54 <agent314_>	it was a bizzare OS
Mar 02 08:48:09 <agent314_>	not based on linux, or anything like that
Mar 02 08:48:37 <agent314_>	it's all packed into one ELF file with processes operating more like threads, sharing all the memory i think
Mar 02 08:48:41 <Gamah>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS_XE#:~:text=Cisco%20IOS%20is%20a%20monolithic,on%20top%20of%20this%20kernel.
Mar 02 08:48:47 <Gamah>	seems the modern one is linux
Mar 02 08:48:47 <Gamah>	neat
Mar 02 08:49:02 <agent314_>	yeah modern one is linux with like busybox i think
Mar 02 08:49:34 <karthy>	Busybox is a shell?
Mar 02 08:49:47 <agent314_>	IOS XE is linux-based, IOS is its own thing
Mar 02 08:50:04 <agent314_>	karthy: busybox is basically taking all the linux utils and shoving them into one elf
Mar 02 08:50:49 <karthy>	Because once I saw busybox when I was configuring a router
Mar 02 08:51:04 <agent314_>	https://boxmatrix.info/wiki/BusyBox-Commands
Mar 02 08:51:17 <agent314_>	karthy: it's super-popular in embedded world
Mar 02 08:51:51 <karthy>	I can’t add or remove pkgs then
Mar 02 08:52:20 <agent314_>	but yeah it basically just takes stuff like pwd, cd, rm, tar, touch and like hundreds more and shoves them into one elf
Mar 02 08:52:34 <agent314_>	karthy: well you can i mean i think it's still linux right?
Mar 02 08:53:20 <karthy>	If you put it that way then yes I guess
Mar 02 08:54:10 <agent314_>	there's like a build wizard or script or something
Mar 02 08:54:25 <agent314_>	that helps you pick which applets to pack into busybox
Mar 02 08:55:07 <agent314_>	but for example let's take the thing that's running on my router right now -- openwrt
Mar 02 08:57:30 <agent314_>	https://paste.linux.chat/?7371b31938f053ef#A4Dn6CbjFRnnChvT1T7dZbcH4k38EMZRt7ybvscnfEEA
Mar 02 08:58:18 <agent314_>	(i so hope i didnt accidentally expose some PII)
Mar 02 08:58:21 <cadmio>	Hello
Mar 02 08:58:23 <cadmio>	do you know how can I control the system's volume with the keyboard?
Mar 02 08:59:08 <agent314_>	cadmio: alsamixer?
Mar 02 08:59:35 <cadmio>	I meank with the '+' and '-' keyboard keys
Mar 02 08:59:36 <agent314_>	or xdotool
Mar 02 08:59:56 <agent314_>	try doing xdotool key XF86AudioRaiseVolume and  XF86AudioLowerVolume
Mar 02 09:00:09 <agent314_>	if that works you can bind it to sxhkd
Mar 02 09:00:33 <agent314_>	cadmio: sorry, i didn't even ask -- whatcha running?
Mar 02 09:00:47 <cadmio>	debian
Mar 02 09:01:10 <agent314_>	same *DEBIAN FTW*
Mar 02 09:01:11 <r-zan>	Actually, something I've noticed. My laptops volume FN buttons work regardless of distro. But at the same time, the brightness control NEVER works
Mar 02 09:02:13 <r-zan>	And debian atm too. Though honestly thinking of just cutting out all the bulk of other distros and making my main machine debian too
Mar 02 09:02:21 <agent314_>	(to finish what i was saying before) like you can see tons of stuff in /bin link to busybox (i think busybox can morph itself into stuff just based on what link it was called with)
Mar 02 09:02:46 <agent314_>	but you can still use package manager like opkg and manage packages no problem
Mar 02 09:03:39 <narcrate140>	whats uop
Mar 02 09:03:40 <narcrate140>	!!
Mar 02 09:04:42 <karthy>	Watup yo narcrate
Mar 02 09:04:49 <narcrate140>	nothingg !!!
Mar 02 09:04:55 <narcrate140>	im ricing my shit
Mar 02 09:05:08 <karthy>	What distro
Mar 02 09:05:33 <narcrate140>	on tht kodachi
Mar 02 09:05:45 <cadmio>	I think it's xbindkeys but I don't know how to edit the file to accomplish what I want
Mar 02 09:05:47 <agent314_>	it's just my other router -- GL-AR300M16-EXT	has like 16 megabytes of flash storage and that is for THE ENTIRE EVERYTHING: kernel, libs, apps, whatever
Mar 02 09:05:56 <agent314_>	narcrate140: oh nice kodachi!
Mar 02 09:06:14 <agent314_>	i have it on my thingy
Mar 02 09:06:23 <narcrate140>	awesome dude!
Mar 02 09:06:28 <agent314_>	vendoy..? vendal...?
Mar 02 09:06:32 <agent314_>	ventoy
Mar 02 09:06:54 <r-zan>	ventoy is amazing
Mar 02 09:06:59 <r-zan>	changed my life
Mar 02 09:07:06 <agent314_>	kodachi is like if tails decide it wasn't concerned about security enough
Mar 02 09:07:12 <narcrate140>	lol true
Mar 02 09:07:13 <agent314_>	*decided
Mar 02 09:07:47 <narcrate140>	im jus fuckin around on distrowatch, scrolling far asf adn downliodaing the first thing lol
Mar 02 09:07:51 <narcrate140>	locking in
Mar 02 09:08:08 <agent314_>	i really appreciate the desktop background that's simultaneously dashboard for all the security stuff
Mar 02 09:08:25 <Disconsented>	language narcrate140
Mar 02 09:08:32 <narcrate140>	sorryyyy
Mar 02 09:08:41 <narcrate140>	:3
Mar 02 09:08:42 <agent314_>	i think more linuxes should use desktop in creative ways like that
Mar 02 09:08:53 <narcrate140>	it looks neat i can say thaty
Mar 02 09:09:02 <amirny2205>	hi! can you please help me with the error? A very simple one https://dpaste.org/y6EjP thank you
Mar 02 09:09:48 <narcrate140>	permission was denied man idk sudosudo tht shit
Mar 02 09:09:54 <narcrate140>	oh whoops i forgot
Mar 02 09:09:58 <narcrate140>	sorry disconttended
Mar 02 09:10:31 <agent314_>	oh i think you have to use sudo weirdly when doing stuff like that
Mar 02 09:10:49 <amirny2205>	sorry my pc went off, was there an answer?
Mar 02 09:11:32 <agent314_>	one simple and brute way would be to just  take everything then sudo sh -c " command here "
Mar 02 09:12:04 <Guest12>	hello my fps is low in linux, how?
Mar 02 09:12:11 <narcrate140>	drivers bad
Mar 02 09:12:18 <narcrate140>	what distro
Mar 02 09:12:22 <agent314_>	or you can switch into root with sudo -s
Mar 02 09:12:37 <agent314_>	amirny2205: that's considering the problem is what i think it is
Mar 02 09:12:39 <Guest12>	fedora
Mar 02 09:12:50 <amirny2205>	agent314_: thanks I'll try it out
Mar 02 09:12:57 <agent314_>	*considering = depending on
Mar 02 09:13:03 <narcrate140>	what graphics? nvidia? what game too?
Mar 02 09:13:04 <Guest12>	fedora es mi distro
Mar 02 09:13:13 <Guest12>	intel, no game
Mar 02 09:13:23 <narcrate140>	oh.
Mar 02 09:13:25 <Guest12>	desktop es laggy
Mar 02 09:13:36 <agent314_>	amirny2205: try sudo sh -c "envsubstr < /etc/nginx/nginx.template.conf > /etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
Mar 02 09:13:44 <narcrate140>	do u have refresh rate set ?
Mar 02 09:13:57 <Guest12>	si, refresh rate 60
Mar 02 09:14:13 <narcrate140>	hmm
Mar 02 09:15:12 <narcrate140>	i got nothing. is it just like the cursor or is the whole desktop lagging
Mar 02 09:18:06 <amirny2205>	agent314_: thanks a lot it seems to be working
Mar 02 09:18:38 <agent314_>	amirny2205: yeah i just did a test here https://paste.linux.chat/?38174afe0ac04320#Hvajnz4tYte4w5K6MuLzQbPES5GJNRztJ1BDCJMBgiVs
Mar 02 09:19:13 <agent314_>	amirny2205: glad it's working! i think there is a more elegant way of doing this and also you will run into complications if you have multiple quotes
Mar 02 09:20:14 <agent314_>	narcrate140: what version of kodachi do you have?
Mar 02 09:21:19 <narcrate140>	newest 8.0
Mar 02 09:21:32 <narcrate140>	is there anything cool abt older versions?
Mar 02 09:21:34 <agent314_>	narcrate140: does it feel like kodachi is dying a bit? i mean if you look at github the latest commits are all like year or two ago
Mar 02 09:22:17 <narcrate140>	i mean other distros have it beat most of the way
Mar 02 09:22:19 <narcrate140>	like tails
Mar 02 09:22:31 <agent314_>	so according to distrowatch latest release 8.27 is 2023-02-22 which is not horrible
Mar 02 09:22:39 <narcrate140>	its p bad lol
Mar 02 09:23:25 <agent314_>	https://github.com/WMAL/kodachi/tree/master it literally has the folder "Kodachi 8.27 source"
Mar 02 09:24:06 <agent314_>	i'm probably going to have to fork it
Mar 02 09:24:27 <narcrate140>	yeah dude fork it !!
Mar 02 09:24:35 <narcrate140>	make it all better
Mar 02 09:24:41 <narcrate140>	itd be awesome
Mar 02 09:25:28 <agent314_>	at the very least it's missing some VPN templates that i'm using actively
Mar 02 09:26:03 <agent314_>	i think it's lacking IVPN
Mar 02 09:26:28 <narcrate140>	hi greenriot
Mar 02 09:26:32 <narcrate140>	hi friend
Mar 02 09:27:24 <agent314_>	yeah it has mullvad vpn but i'm also using IVPN which is not very fun having to re-configure that every time
Mar 02 09:27:44 <narcrate140>	i bet
Mar 02 09:27:50 <agent314_>	plus, i think i just realized.. maybe it's a mistake but
Mar 02 09:28:02 <agent314_>	did it not have wireguard?
Mar 02 09:28:21 <narcrate140>	lol
Mar 02 09:28:24 <agent314_>	i might have to spin it up right now
Mar 02 09:31:14 *	agent314_ is looking for his ventoy flashdrive
Mar 02 09:31:36 <agent314_>	hey has anyone seen my ventoy flash? it's like blue kinda, it was here somewhere
Mar 02 09:31:55 <narcrate140>	check the spot dude
Mar 02 09:32:25 <agent314_>	excuse me i think it might be under this desk
Mar 02 09:32:27 <agent314_>	(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
Mar 02 09:32:34 <narcrate140>	lol
Mar 02 09:32:37 <amirny2205>	envsubst doesn't work for some reason, can you help me with it? thanks https://dpaste.org/9aYKd
Mar 02 09:32:57 <agent314_>	no, it was under those desks i think ┻━┻︵ \(°□°)/ ︵ ┻━┻ im sorry for the mess guys
Mar 02 09:33:06 <narcrate140>	wow man. clean up after urself
Mar 02 09:33:24 <agent314_>	sorry sorry ┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)
Mar 02 09:34:55 <agent314_>	could it possibly be the flash drive that has the word 'VENTOY' written on it in white marker?
Mar 02 09:36:18 <agent314_>	oh sweet, kodachi 8.27 and tails 5.21 and this cool fellow called Fedora Core Security Live
Mar 02 09:36:46 <agent314_>	feora has these like "concentrations" now for live cds
Mar 02 09:37:06 <narcrate140>	thats coolz
Mar 02 09:37:43 <agent314_>	oh no it's called labs
Mar 02 09:38:17 <agent314_>	https://labs.fedoraproject.org/
Mar 02 09:38:52 <narcrate140>	agent314_ how long have u been linuxing, u seem p well versed in everythingh
Mar 02 09:39:41 <agent314_>	narcrate140: uhm i think the first time i have played with gnome or something was in 2003
Mar 02 09:39:58 <agent314_>	or 2002
Mar 02 09:40:01 <narcrate140>	DAMN
Mar 02 09:40:05 <narcrate140>	jesus
Mar 02 09:40:25 <agent314_>	god im old
Mar 02 09:40:29 <narcrate140>	u are
Mar 02 09:40:37 <narcrate140>	sorry.
Mar 02 09:40:47 <r-zan>	agen314, serious question
Mar 02 09:40:50 <agent314_>	for internet 30 is like superold
Mar 02 09:40:58 <r-zan>	what was the fall of constantianople like?
Mar 02 09:41:05 <narcrate140>	jej
Mar 02 09:41:34 <Gamah>	r-zan: it's istanbul not constantinople
Mar 02 09:41:36 <agent314_>	i just realized there are probably people here that have not been born during 9/11
Mar 02 09:41:39 <narcrate140>	he was there during the peak of irc isnt that crazy
Mar 02 09:41:56 <narcrate140>	i wasnt born for 911
Mar 02 09:41:58 <Gamah>	agent314_: on irc? probably not many...
Mar 02 09:42:04 <r-zan>	jokes aside, that one actually messes with me a little bit
Mar 02 09:42:06 <Gamah>	i'd be surprised if it's a majority
Mar 02 09:43:06 *	agent314_ just realized Disconsented is watching this chat with eyes like ಠ_ಠ 
Mar 02 09:43:29 <agent314_>	maybe we should relocate to linux-offtopic
Mar 02 09:43:39 <r-zan>	Oh uh
Mar 02 09:44:13 <r-zan>	someone sell me on tiling wms because I just dont get it
Mar 02 09:44:50 <Gamah>	r-zan: count how many times you touch your mouse in the day just to get to the next thing you actually wanted to do with your keyboard
Mar 02 09:44:54 <agent314_>	i swear he's over there, he's watching us man, it doesn't look like it but i can definitely sense his attention neurons dialed in rihgt where we are
Mar 02 09:45:45 <Gamah>	agent314_: maybe i'm more submissive but i've never felt like i've caught the ire of Disconsented more than a suggestion that a topic should change.
Mar 02 09:46:04 <r-zan>	lemme try
Mar 02 09:46:12 <r-zan>	I'm a windows user
Mar 02 09:46:20 <r-zan>	...nope
Mar 02 09:46:38 <narcrate140>	panorain has joined #linux
Mar 02 09:46:42 <narcrate140>	hi !!
Mar 02 09:47:12 <Gamah>	r-zan: an app that plays an obnoxious sound every time you do window management would be funny
Mar 02 09:47:28 <atreo>	people when i use "time"  to time how long a command takes to run i get three outputs   (real 0m9.941s    user 0m0.042s    sys 0m0.041s)   what are these and which one should I used as the correct time?
Mar 02 09:47:31 <panorain>	Hi
Mar 02 09:47:36 <Gamah>	i think tiling is coming to windows soon, the new layout stuff they added in win11 is pretty neat
Mar 02 09:47:38 <narcrate140>	hi
Mar 02 09:47:47 <Artfaith>	atreo, have you tried `man time`?
Mar 02 09:47:47 *	agent314_ will start getting refugee tents in linux-offtopic 
Mar 02 09:48:08 <Artfaith>	Just in case, you may want `date` for actual time.
Mar 02 09:48:12 <r-zan>	I need to stop procrastinating and just register so I can use all the rooms
Mar 02 09:48:13 <agent314_>	Gamah: oh man i actually first tried a tiling WM like a few weeks ago
Mar 02 09:48:32 <Gamah>	i think i use i3 now? because keeping haskell around just for xmonad was annoying
Mar 02 09:48:46 <agent314_>	i was exploring all the WMs and then it was I3's turn
Mar 02 09:48:48 <Gamah>	might be aweswm, i have no idea... dont use that machine that much, but it is nice when i do
Mar 02 09:48:52 <narcrate140>	oh hi dvvv
Mar 02 09:48:57 <dvvv>	hello
Mar 02 09:48:59 <r-zan>	And I like the core concept of them, like I actually rarely use my mouse except for well... window management and browsers.
Mar 02 09:49:11 <agent314_>	i think the way i felt is how people are portrayed when they first get into vim
Mar 02 09:49:30 <atreo>	Artfaith: yes, most of what i saw was formatting the time, but i did not understand the difference between the three outputs and why they are different
Mar 02 09:49:33 <agent314_>	'what is this?' 'where am i?' 'where are the windows?' 'what is going on?'
Mar 02 09:49:36 <r-zan>	But thats the thing that keeps me out of committing to one. The moment I open a browser, it's back to mouse drudgery. Oh and, trying to make everything actually fit my flashy little theme
Mar 02 09:49:38 <Gamah>	r-zan: it's a huge learning curve.... it will be tediious and annoying for probably months if you decide to try to switch
Mar 02 09:50:12 <Gamah>	r-zan: a probably decent comparison, i recently forced myself to go with a 80% keyboard for work since i travel fairly often now.... been numpad only my whole life
Mar 02 09:50:16 <Artfaith>	atreo, `time` is not `date`. `time` is generally used for measuring execution time of certain process.
Mar 02 09:50:19 <Gamah>	i still reach over and slap my desk fairly often, it's been 6 months
Mar 02 09:50:29 <Gamah>	but i am becoming proficient at the toprow numbers
Mar 02 09:50:34 <atreo>	Artfaith: exactly  yes   but there are three of them
Mar 02 09:50:40 <r-zan>	I will die before I give up my numpad >:(
Mar 02 09:50:50 <Gamah>	i still prefer it for calculator
Mar 02 09:50:51 <Artfaith>	[x2] atreo, have you tried `man time`?
Mar 02 09:50:56 <r-zan>	You ever try playing a roguelike with vim keys? It's awful
Mar 02 09:50:57 <Artfaith>	`man` means "manual"
Mar 02 09:51:07 <Artfaith>	There you will find the exact explanation.
Mar 02 09:51:23 <atreo>	Artfaith: [x2]   yes,    i am trying to measure execution time of a command but I get 3 outputs, the man page doesn't explain hat they are
Mar 02 09:51:30 <Artfaith>	...
Mar 02 09:51:33 <agent314_>	i basically have gotten comfortable in like Plasma or E  with 4 desktops that i move around using Windows + 1,2,3,4 buttons
Mar 02 09:52:07 <agent314_>	atreo: how much do you care about precision?
Mar 02 09:52:14 <Gamah>	Artfaith: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/time.1.html
Mar 02 09:52:28 <Gamah>	tl;dr each measure is the amount of time the application you timed spent in different system contexts
Mar 02 09:52:37 <narcrate140>	alright agent314_ im gonna log off tn, its like 3 am ololol
Mar 02 09:52:44 <narcrate140>	was nice speaking to u
Mar 02 09:52:47 <atreo>	agent314_: a little    i want to compare the same command executed in different enviroments
Mar 02 09:52:49 <agent314_>	narcrate140: it's 1am here
Mar 02 09:53:13 <narcrate140>	bye !!
Mar 02 09:53:19 <agent314_>	but yeah nice talking to you to! btw if i dont reply to privmsg its because i was trying out weechat or irssi and got
Mar 02 09:53:38 <agent314_>	confused trying to open private chat
Mar 02 09:54:12 <Artfaith>	Gamah?
Mar 02 09:54:35 <Artfaith>	atreo, from the manual, as mentioned: > time -f "\t%E real,\t%U user,\t%S sys" ls -Fs... E - Elapsed real (wall clock) time used by the process, in [hours:]minutes:seconds... U      Total number of CPU-seconds that the process used directly (in user mode), in seconds... S      Total number of CPU-seconds used by the system on behalf of the process (in kernel mode), in seconds...
Mar 02 09:54:37 <agent314_>	atreo: the subject you're gonna need to google is called profiling
Mar 02 09:55:14 <atreo>	agent314_: oh   i see    ok let me search
Mar 02 09:55:16 <Artfaith>	You get E, U, and S, by default, and you see the description of each.
Mar 02 09:55:28 <atreo>	Artfaith: ok let me try to understand it
Mar 02 09:56:42 <agent314_>	atreo: but it really depends on what exactly you're trying to measure and what your desired precision is
Mar 02 09:57:56 <agent314_>	at some point you'll prbably have to abandon time and attach to process using gdb and then use something like gdbprofiler or gprof
Mar 02 09:58:25 <Gamah>	Artfaith: sry wrong tab complete
Mar 02 09:58:26 <atreo>	agent314_: i have a script that runs image rendering on a GPU, and I want to test the speed of the rendering of the same image on different GPUs and multiple GPUs,    then repeat with larger image sizes     that way I can see what is the bet GPU type and estimate the cost for duffernt image sizes
Mar 02 09:59:08 <Gamah>	atreo: it's not uncommon to just time that in miliseconds passed within the script instead of having to parse output from something like time
Mar 02 09:59:26 <Artfaith>	atreo, what is the library? Vulcan? OpenGL?
Mar 02 09:59:32 <agent314_>	atreo: if this is at all important i think i would basically use a completely clean OS
Mar 02 10:00:01 <Gamah>	https://github.com/LTTLabsOSS/markbench-tests
Mar 02 10:00:16 <Gamah>	this is a pretty neat project for that kind of thing
Mar 02 10:00:25 <Gamah>	even if i'm not a fan of lttstoredotcom
Mar 02 10:01:02 <agent314_>	from what you're saying it doesn't seem to me like disk performance is going to be a bottleneck so you can probably even do like a flash drive live profiler
Mar 02 10:01:17 <agent314_>	Gamah: oh interesting
Mar 02 10:01:26 <agent314_>	i didnt know they published that stuff
Mar 02 10:01:48 <Gamah>	i don't have an articuable reason for why i don't ilke the guy, but i can't disagree with a lot of his principles...
Mar 02 10:01:49 <atreo>	Artfaith: i am not really sure what you mean , but it is just a CLI program, like ffmpeg
Mar 02 10:02:21 <agent314_>	i basically use phoronix for all my testing needs because it covers linux, windows, mac and basically every area of benchmarking i need for the most part that is
Mar 02 10:02:38 <Artfaith>	atreo, I mean that if you want to profile graphics processing, you should be aware of what you are profiling in the first place.
Mar 02 10:03:06 <atreo>	Artfaith: what do you mean? explain more, what should i be paying attention to?
Mar 02 10:03:16 <agent314_>	atreo: he's asking what your "competitor" is based on like fraemworks talking
Mar 02 10:03:29 <Artfaith>	Both Vulcan and OpenGL (and others) normally have either built-in or custom profiling options.
Mar 02 10:03:34 <Artfaith>	For example, https://github.com/lstalmir/VulkanProfiler
Mar 02 10:03:41 <atreo>	oh
Mar 02 10:04:06 <atreo>	no i don't think this program hase internal benchmarking parameters
Mar 02 10:04:20 <Gamah>	someday i want to know how that nvidia tool to step through and profile a game's frame being rendered works... i've onlyseen screenshots or little gifs about it but it looks really neat
Mar 02 10:05:13 <agent314_>	probably tons of expensive GPUs
Mar 02 10:05:39 <atreo>	its ok, i think what i need for my purpose is just the "real" time     which is calculated in minutes and seconds correct?   not milli seconds
Mar 02 10:05:43 <Artfaith>	OpenGL, https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Debugging_Tools#BuGLe
Mar 02 10:05:58 <Artfaith>	atreo, it is written right above. Do you read...?
Mar 02 10:06:08 <Artfaith>	It's written in both the manual and this chat.
Mar 02 10:06:17 <agent314_>	atreo: either that or you can "make" your test get measured in minutes and seconds
Mar 02 10:06:28 <Artfaith>	[Re] > time -f "\t%E real,\t%U user,\t%S sys" ls -Fs... E - Elapsed real (wall clock) time used by the process, in [hours:]minutes:seconds...
Mar 02 10:06:56 <agent314_>	say by piling a couple of million small tests in predictable fashion
Mar 02 10:07:30 <Artfaith>	atreo, `time` has option `-v` also for more verbose output.
Mar 02 10:07:38 <Artfaith>	For example, https://stackoverflow.com/a/385422/5113030
Mar 02 10:07:40 <Gamah>	atreo: does your script have variables? like can you set "x" to the current timestamp?
Mar 02 10:08:14 <agent314_>	you're still going to want to repeat even the big test a few times obviously
Mar 02 10:08:29 <agent314_>	i suggest looking and running some of phoronix tests
Mar 02 10:08:38 <Gamah>	oooo i should run a big blackjack simulation on my beefy new server
Mar 02 10:08:40 <atreo>	Gamah: no  its series of bash commands
Mar 02 10:08:50 <Gamah>	atreo: bash has variables though doesn't it?
Mar 02 10:08:59 <Gamah>	and math
Mar 02 10:09:11 <AndyCap>	"math"
Mar 02 10:09:16 <atreo>	Gamah: yes each command has its flags and variables
Mar 02 10:09:17 <Gamah>	so you could take a timestamp in ms... then subtract the new timestamp from the old one
Mar 02 10:09:25 <AndyCap>	math is not bash's strong suit
Mar 02 10:09:40 <Gamah>	AndyCap: i mean it's just subtraction
Mar 02 10:09:42 <agent314_>	yeah so there's several timers in OS
Mar 02 10:10:35 <atreo>	hmmmmm
Mar 02 10:10:47 <Artfaith>	`/usr/bin/time -v -- bash ./script.sh`
Mar 02 10:10:48 <atreo>	Gamah:  i get what you are saying    ok
Mar 02 10:11:05 <Artfaith>	`/usr/bin/time -v -- bash -x -- ./script.sh`
Mar 02 10:11:11 <agent314_>	what you're looking for is high resolution timers
Mar 02 10:11:32 <agent314_>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Precision_Event_Timer
Mar 02 10:11:46 <Gamah>	i'm not sure atreo really knows what they're looking for, have they given us an example of what kind of output they want to compare between these benchmarks?
Mar 02 10:11:49 <agent314_>	https://elinux.org/High_Resolution_Timers
Mar 02 10:12:09 <AndyCap>	if the job actually takes 9 minutes you might not need less than milisecond timing
Mar 02 10:12:25 <Gamah>	^
Mar 02 10:13:03 <AndyCap>	as long as you're not confounding things and the actual work you want to measure is a small fraction of the total run time
Mar 02 10:13:31 <agent314_>	cat /proc/timer_list here's how you grab all the timers on your system
Mar 02 10:13:37 <Gamah>	also who's the audience for the results
Mar 02 10:14:01 <Gamah>	agent314_: but what about the overhead of calling cat? :think:
Mar 02 10:14:02 <AndyCap>	e.g. it spend 8 minutes and 55 seconds wrangling data and I/O and then only 5 seconds for the thing running on the graphics cards
Mar 02 10:14:07 <agent314_>	Gamah: yeah i sort of agree but maybe in a way that's more sympathetic to atreo :)
Mar 02 10:14:17 <atreo>	Gamah: its ok , printing date before and after my script + the time of the script might be what i am looking for
Mar 02 10:14:32 <Gamah>	atreo: you could go even further....
Mar 02 10:14:34 <agent314_>	Gamah: sorry that's to get like information abou ttimers
Mar 02 10:14:40 <agent314_>	*about timers
Mar 02 10:15:09 <Gamah>	atreo: you could capture the current milisecond.... and hold it in a variable at the top of the script, then scubtract the "now current" milisecond from the first one and just print out the elapsted time at the end so you don't have to do the math yourself :)
Mar 02 10:15:25 <agent314_>	there are multiple ways in which a timer can work, including multiple physical ways
Mar 02 10:15:34 <eqw>	why adduser --group is mutually exclusive with --gid ? I can create a group and user in one move but can control only uid
Mar 02 10:15:34 <atreo>	Gamah: you are right   that is better
Mar 02 10:16:20 <Disconsented>	Gamah> funny tha
Mar 02 10:16:21 <Disconsented>	t
Mar 02 10:16:32 <agent314_>	cat /proc/timer_list basically just gets the relatively static information, there's no need to worry about overhead of cat.. you're finding out things like how many timer objects you have what their precision is
Mar 02 10:16:47 <Artfaith>	Just in case, your Bash version should have `EPOCHREALTIME`.
Mar 02 10:16:55 <Artfaith>	If it's just what you want.
Mar 02 10:16:58 <Gamah>	Disconsented: wiat what's funny?
Mar 02 10:17:18 <Gamah>	Artfaith: ty i knew it existed but didn't know the name
Mar 02 10:17:23 <Disconsented>	Folks following the rules so ops dont need to say anything :P
Mar 02 10:17:53 <Artfaith>	e.g. `date -ud "@${EPOCHREALTIME}" -- '+%F_%T';`
Mar 02 10:17:56 <agent314_>	like there are jiffies
Mar 02 10:18:08 <Gamah>	Disconsented: i usually find i don't have to think about following rules by just being a decent human who isn't interested in breaking rules.
Mar 02 10:19:06 <agent314_>	which actually has its own header file linux/jiffies.h
Mar 02 10:19:35 <Gamah>	Disconsented: tho i think i've gotten in trouble for jokingly including an rm command before.... so i digress
Mar 02 10:19:43 <Gamah>	that was probably back on freenode
Mar 02 10:20:05 <Disconsented>	We really do not like that here just fyi
Mar 02 10:20:22 <Gamah>	of course
Mar 02 10:20:44 *	agent314_ was a bit uncoordinated at first, mostly not realizing there is rooms beyond #linux that are actually alive and well
Mar 02 10:20:51 <agent314_>	*there are
Mar 02 10:21:00 <Gamah>	i wouldn't do it to someone who i didn't think knew better, and the discussion was pretty well in depth... but alas i did technically break the rule and some op had to make sure i heard about it
Mar 02 10:21:05 <Gamah>	message received
Mar 02 10:21:08 *	Gamah salutes
Mar 02 10:21:43 <Gamah>	agent314_: ##programming is pretty funny
Mar 02 10:21:52 <Gamah>	#hardware is.... sometimes useful
Mar 02 10:21:54 <agent314_>	i don't think i realized how big libera is
Mar 02 10:22:00 <Disconsented>	Always*
Mar 02 10:22:15 <Gamah>	it's just freenode 2.0 minus all the people that have been dead/idle there for the last 15 years
Mar 02 10:22:18 <panorain>	Hi, I have a laptop with i915 gpu integrated.
Mar 02 10:22:30 <Gamah>	Disconsented: are you alwaysing programming being funny or hardware being useful
Mar 02 10:22:39 <Disconsented>	Hardware being useful
Mar 02 10:22:47 <live2>	it's a pointer to a structure of a type Always
Mar 02 10:22:48 <Disconsented>	It has nothing to do with me having op there a well
Mar 02 10:23:09 <Gamah>	Disconsented: then why won't they recommend a laptop with 3 basic requirements and a budget? :(
Mar 02 10:23:18 <fb`>	eqw
Mar 02 10:23:25 <Disconsented>	Honestly, burn out is a lot of it
Mar 02 10:23:40 <Disconsented>	folks wont put in the effort, and expect us to do it all
Mar 02 10:23:47 <Gamah>	i just figure that's the go to place with people who obsess over what's out and the latest and greatest.... i have no interest inthat
Mar 02 10:24:37 <Disconsented>	and there is the instance of folks wanting to play 20 questions all the time
Mar 02 10:24:42 <agent314_>	honestly, last time i was somewhat active in IRC was like 15-20 years ago
Mar 02 10:24:51 <Disconsented>	I've just largely given up and only moderate at this stage
Mar 02 10:24:53 <fb`>	eqw common practice is to create group(s) with groupadd first, then useradd/adduser, it's a two part process
Mar 02 10:26:16 <agent314_>	and i think it's been about a month or two since I began IRCing regularly again
Mar 02 10:26:23 <Gamah>	totally agree... and nobody has any reason to believe i'm not going to shift the goalposts... but so far all i get is "gaming laptop bad" and assumptions that i'd be wasing money or something as if i must buy a desktop or business class machine to sit in my backpack with the business class machine or exist along sinde my desktop at home :/
Mar 02 10:26:34 <Artfaith>	atreo, e.g.
Mar 02 10:26:36 <Artfaith>	# work() { sleep 1; }; s="$EPOCHREALTIME"; work "$@"; date -ud "@$( perl -e "printf('%s', ${EPOCHREALTIME} - ${s})"; )" -- '+%T.%N';
Mar 02 10:26:41 <Gamah>	fb`: sometimes i find myself making groups for users afterwards and adding them
Mar 02 10:26:48 <eqw>	fb`: another common practice is to create a group for each user and it's neat them to have same IDs
Mar 02 10:27:04 <atreo>	Artfaith: excellent   thanks i will use that
Mar 02 10:27:18 <agent314_>	are we still talking about profiling and timers?
Mar 02 10:27:25 <Disconsented>	One piece of advice, talk about the problem you're trying to solve and folks will generally be a lot more willing to help
Mar 02 10:27:28 <Disconsented>	Well.. at least I will
Mar 02 10:27:31 <Gamah>	agent314_: i think it's profiling/timer adjacent, just a quick benchmark :)
Mar 02 10:27:42 <Gamah>	Disconsented: hmmmmm i'll try it. i thought i did before
Mar 02 10:27:53 <Disconsented>	iirc you pretty much just went, gib laptop
Mar 02 10:27:56 <AndyCap>	and now you have a dependency on perl because bash's math sucks
Mar 02 10:28:15 *	agent314_ is so bad at perl :(
Mar 02 10:28:46 <hackinghorn>	hm I don't even know perl
Mar 02 10:29:08 <agent314_>	well, tbh, i can regexp my way out of a tight spot
Mar 02 10:29:20 <fb`>	eqw yes -- i prefer a matched gid and uid, passing `--non-unique -u <id>` to useradd
Mar 02 10:29:22 <agent314_>	and from what i remember perl is like 80% regexps
Mar 02 10:29:28 *	Artfaith considers Perl a must in any shell.
Mar 02 10:29:30 <AntonoiCarpio>	just use powershell on linux
Mar 02 10:29:33 <hackinghorn>	I heard regex is evil
Mar 02 10:29:44 <hackinghorn>	why perl when I have bash and python
Mar 02 10:30:01 <Artfaith>	hackinghorn, `man perl`.
Mar 02 10:30:24 <AntonoiCarpio>	man powershell
Mar 02 10:30:29 <Gamah>	Disconsented: i mean i can google and talk about the same 5-6 models that everyone else is also going to find... just haven't been keeping track on individual brands or generations of hardware and how they're doing these days
Mar 02 10:30:53 <Gamah>	kinda like the other day when i said going new in box am4 for a new build today is a bad buy imo
Mar 02 10:31:05 <hackinghorn>	why name it perl when you can name it pearl?
Mar 02 10:31:30 <agent314_>	actually that's what it comes from i think
Mar 02 10:31:38 <agent314_>	the guy who invented it was really into bible
Mar 02 10:31:54 <agent314_>	that's why you have like bless in perl
Mar 02 10:32:05 <hackinghorn>	oh pearl was another programming language so they changed
Mar 02 10:32:20 <buraq>	perl harbour
Mar 02 10:32:34 <agent314_>	i feel like there's a point someone reaches
Mar 02 10:32:39 <Artfaith>	Related: https://perlmaven.com/compare-the-speed-of-perl-and-python-regex
Mar 02 10:32:50 <Artfaith>	PCRE <3
Mar 02 10:33:10 <agent314_>	like once they study perl.. they study study study and at some point there's like a switch in their brain and from that point they're trying to write everything in perl
Mar 02 10:33:23 <live2>	mod_perl
Mar 02 10:33:40 <AntonoiCarpio>	perl should replace python
Mar 02 10:33:42 <hackinghorn>	huh
Mar 02 10:33:47 <louipc>	AntonoiCarpio: i'm down
Mar 02 10:33:55 <hackinghorn>	can you write everything in perl?
Mar 02 10:33:58 <AntonoiCarpio>	but, use powershell instead of bash
Mar 02 10:34:02 <AntonoiCarpio>	thats my take too
Mar 02 10:34:09 <louipc>	but i think maybe javascript is the way forward
Mar 02 10:34:12 <louipc>	ironically
Mar 02 10:34:15 <buraq>	hackinghorn: it's called cpan
Mar 02 10:34:25 <agent314_>	one of my favorite things in linux is nushell
Mar 02 10:34:27 <fb`>	eqw as well as `--no-user-group --gid <gid>` to specify a custom gid
Mar 02 10:34:32 <louipc>	javascript/typescript
Mar 02 10:34:47 <buraq>	The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) currently has 218,180 Perl modules
Mar 02 10:34:58 <Helenah>	What's a good way of storing RSA keys so they can be easily managed and don't get lost?
Mar 02 10:34:58 <louipc>	whats a nushell
Mar 02 10:35:10 <louipc>	lost how?
Mar 02 10:35:22 <Helenah>	Well they're data, data can get lost.
Mar 02 10:35:23 <agent314_>	CPAN just reminds me of like EMACS and MELPA
Mar 02 10:35:23 <buraq>	Helenah: backup
Mar 02 10:35:39 <louipc>	what about an sqlite db
Mar 02 10:35:48 <louipc>	yea and put it in the cloud!
Mar 02 10:36:03 <Helenah>	I don't want it in the cloud.
Mar 02 10:36:11 <buraq>	in my cloud? my cloud is my pc!
Mar 02 10:36:22 <louipc>	yea your cloud!
Mar 02 10:36:37 <buraq>	i need to upgrade my cloud and the internet connection
Mar 02 10:36:39 <buraq>	shit
Mar 02 10:36:40 <louipc>	put em in a bunch of auto syncing raspis
Mar 02 10:36:44 <AntonoiCarpio>	cloud desktop
Mar 02 10:36:49 <louipc>	across the globe
Mar 02 10:36:56 <AntonoiCarpio>	desktop as a service
Mar 02 10:37:06 <Alexey_>	http://explorer.net.ru:8080/temp/coaxil.jpg
Mar 02 10:37:17 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Disconsented
Mar 02 10:37:18 <agent314_>	if you pour some water on your pc
Mar 02 10:37:19 <buraq>	risque click of the day
Mar 02 10:37:20 *	Disconsented sets ban on *!~Alexey@95.165.151.*
Mar 02 10:37:22 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 02 10:37:23 *	litharge has kicked Alexey_ from #linux (Discuss your ban in #linux-ops.)
Mar 02 10:37:34 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 02 10:37:47 <buraq>	pour some sugar on me
Mar 02 10:37:49 <Helenah>	I'm pretty sure for something to be considered a cloud, it needs to have redundant servers in different parts of the world...
Mar 02 10:38:05 <agent314_>	... then you'll have a bad time taking apart everything and searching for a donor touchpad board
Mar 02 10:38:11 <louipc>	lol that guy is hilarious
Mar 02 10:38:15 <Helenah>	I'm pretty sure you can't just set up an internet-accessible server and call it a cloud...
Mar 02 10:38:27 <louipc>	i wonder if theres some other way to manage him than constant banning
Mar 02 10:38:31 <buraq>	it's just a little cloud :)
Mar 02 10:38:32 <EdFletcher>	you need _two_ internet-accessible servers 😆
Mar 02 10:38:35 *	agent314_ was going to make a joke about water in pc, heating it up and amking a cloud
Mar 02 10:38:45 <Helenah>	EdFletcher: That's literally it?
Mar 02 10:38:55 <louipc>	but i know there are other people where its impossible. just have to ban forever
Mar 02 10:38:58 <Helenah>	So my home is therefore a cloud, EdFletcher ?
Mar 02 10:39:08 <EdFletcher>	Helenah: one's a computer, two's a cloud! ☁️
Mar 02 10:39:24 <agent314_>	cloud is a marketing term
Mar 02 10:39:34 <agent314_>	from what i understood
Mar 02 10:39:46 <Helenah>	So ns1.helservers.net and ns2.helservers.net and helservers.net which is a web server, all this is a cloud, EdFletcher ?
Mar 02 10:39:51 <AntonoiCarpio>	I know there is also sky computing
Mar 02 10:39:53 <EdFletcher>	if the cloud is just other people's computers, eventually you might be one of the other people right? it all tracks
Mar 02 10:39:55 <agent314_>	like i remember we've had linode and slicehost
Mar 02 10:39:59 <AntonoiCarpio>	Aside from cloud computing
Mar 02 10:40:06 <EdFletcher>	Helenah: the helservers.net cloud!
Mar 02 10:40:08 <agent314_>	years before clouds
Mar 02 10:40:11 <AndyCap>	you don't need redundant servers in different parts of the world for it to be a cloud
Mar 02 10:40:15 <Helenah>	agent314_: I thought it was a concept? But yeah, a fancy word like "cloud" might have been chosen for marketing purposes.
Mar 02 10:40:28 <buraq>	there's a place called hel in poland
Mar 02 10:40:36 <Helenah>	EdFletcher: Interesting, I didn't know my home was a cloud, thanks. lol
Mar 02 10:40:51 <EdFletcher>	Helenah: hahaha you're welcome, congrats! 😜
Mar 02 10:41:00 <agent314_>	well cloud is just trying to encompass an area that is too big for one word to cover
Mar 02 10:41:07 <Helenah>	EdFletcher: I <3 my home being my cloud! <3
Mar 02 10:41:21 <AndyCap>	but after people started marketing everything as cloud, someone sat down and tried to define it. https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf#page=6
Mar 02 10:41:38 <agent314_>	i think in 2010-2011ish the vibe between cloud and VPS was that cloud is auto-adjusting
Mar 02 10:41:38 <louipc>	how much for a helservers account
Mar 02 10:41:41 <EdFletcher>	Helenah: ❤️
Mar 02 10:41:53 <Helenah>	❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Mar 02 10:42:09 <live2>	❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Mar 02 10:42:10 <AndyCap>	self-service access to flexible compute resources on someone elses computer
Mar 02 10:42:18 <Artfaith>	Thank you, AndyCap, for the normal reference.
Mar 02 10:42:21 *	ChanServ removes channel operator status from Disconsented
Mar 02 10:42:27 <Helenah>	louipc: For you sir (USD currency), that would be $100/month, sir!
Mar 02 10:42:40 <louipc>	yikes!
Mar 02 10:42:45 <Helenah>	BIG YIKES!
Mar 02 10:42:46 <agent314_>	like with VPS if you make a mistake and start consuming tons of compute your VPS will just run in 100% cpu load and maybe crash
Mar 02 10:42:50 <EdFletcher>	it's a Premium Cloud (TM)
Mar 02 10:42:51 <Helenah>	Truth is... I'm not selling it. lol
Mar 02 10:42:57 <louipc>	must be the 3000 day mayan calendar month
Mar 02 10:43:03 <louipc>	:P
Mar 02 10:43:05 <Helenah>	So say I did sell it to someone, I'd want a good whack off of them.
Mar 02 10:43:09 <buraq>	EdFletcher: my little cloud is called titanium cloud
Mar 02 10:43:21 <agent314_>	whilst the joyful world of cloud brings us wonderful opportunities like that one little bug blowing up your compute and costing you $300,000 in compute basically next morning
Mar 02 10:43:22 <louipc>	Helenah: do you accept arms and legs
Mar 02 10:43:29 <EdFletcher>	buraq: sounds like a solid cloud!
Mar 02 10:43:36 <Helenah>	louipc: I'll accept both your kidneys and your liver. :3
Mar 02 10:43:48 <louipc>	yikes!
Mar 02 10:43:58 <agent314_>	anyone got an extra liver i'll take it
Mar 02 10:44:00 <Helenah>	I arranged for some medical professionals to hook you up to life support and get you comfortable with a laptop.
Mar 02 10:44:04 <louipc>	with a nice chianti
Mar 02 10:44:08 <Helenah>	It's part of the service
Mar 02 10:44:41 <agent314_>	btw is anyone paying attention to neurolink?
Mar 02 10:44:50 <louipc>	hey if it worked for robocop why not
Mar 02 10:44:57 <agent314_>	does anyone know what software it's running?
Mar 02 10:45:06 <agent314_>	or hardware
Mar 02 10:45:08 <EdFletcher>	TempleOS i think
Mar 02 10:45:17 <agent314_>	lol that would be just so good
Mar 02 10:45:25 <EdFletcher>	hahaha right?
Mar 02 10:45:28 <louipc>	that would be rekt
Mar 02 10:45:32 <Helenah>	EdFletcher: Wow we can talk to god with our minds?
Mar 02 10:45:38 <fb`>	that waitbuywhy series on neuralink was pretty hype, then it all kinda fizzled out
Mar 02 10:45:42 <buraq>	silence of the lambs vibes there
Mar 02 10:45:51 <EdFletcher>	Helenah: exactly! a direct connection
Mar 02 10:45:56 <Helenah>	Finally the religious folk can finally claim they heard god tell them what to do and it'll finally for the first time be the truth.
Mar 02 10:45:58 <Helenah>	lol
Mar 02 10:46:02 <fb`>	*waitbutwhy
Mar 02 10:46:20 <agent314_>	"Did i.. did i just undergo a hugely invasive and expensive brain procedure that left me with a sense of taste in my left thumb and you're saying you're running templeos in my brain?"
Mar 02 10:46:38 <EdFletcher>	LOL
Mar 02 10:46:57 <Helenah>	agent314_: lol
Mar 02 10:47:16 *	Helenah dips agent314_'s left thumb into some penguin to give them a taste for Linux
Mar 02 10:47:25 <fb`>	seems like external/ekg would be a lot easier
Mar 02 10:47:59 <agent314_>	what exactly should /me visualize when thinking about dipping thumbs into penguins?
Mar 02 10:48:14 <agent314_>	are these penguins pulverized into a sort of smoothie?
Mar 02 10:48:21 <Helenah>	visualise, not taste? o:
Mar 02 10:48:28 <Helenah>	Damn something really is wrong with your wiring!
Mar 02 10:48:50 <agent314_>	hey i'm tasting too many penguins in my left thumb !
Mar 02 10:49:35 <louipc>	whos god
Mar 02 10:49:36 <buraq>	agent314_: is that some kind of ritual to be accepted as a linux user?
Mar 02 10:49:44 <Helenah>	lol
Mar 02 10:50:08 <Helenah>	Btw, I switched from bind9 to PowerDNS last night. :3
Mar 02 10:50:16 <agent314_>	actually you know what, i totally realized i need more concurrently running CPUs that are executing some form of linux
Mar 02 10:50:25 <louipc>	hows it feel
Mar 02 10:50:45 <Helenah>	louipc: Like a day out with tuxie! :3
Mar 02 10:50:45 <louipc>	i kinda wanna get away from linux
Mar 02 10:50:48 <agent314_>	tell us
Mar 02 10:51:00 <Helenah>	louipc: There's the BSDs.
Mar 02 10:51:19 <agent314_>	can you connect databases to powerdns?
Mar 02 10:51:20 <Helenah>	You can spend some time with the devil.
Mar 02 10:51:33 <Helenah>	TempleOS for god, and BSD for satan.
Mar 02 10:51:33 <agent314_>	there's also FreeRTOS
Mar 02 10:51:39 <fb`>	what about hurd?
Mar 02 10:51:41 <agent314_>	and my favorite -- Cisco IOS
Mar 02 10:51:48 <agent314_>	the best operating system
Mar 02 10:51:50 <louipc>	Helenah: seL4
Mar 02 10:51:58 <Helenah>	Why would you use a real time OS for general purpose?
Mar 02 10:52:10 <louipc>	to be extra 1337
Mar 02 10:52:34 <louipc>	seL4 on some riscv machine
Mar 02 10:52:45 <agent314_>	Helenah: because i found raspberry pi pico and did not find raspberry pi zero in my box of things?
Mar 02 10:53:01 <Helenah>	But it isn't extra elite, real time priorities are good for certain tasks, not all.
Mar 02 10:53:15 <Helenah>	agent314_: Ah
Mar 02 10:53:17 <louipc>	it actually is good for all
Mar 02 10:53:23 <agent314_>	there's also something called QNX
Mar 02 10:53:32 <louipc>	its been entering mainstream OS by drips and drabs
Mar 02 10:53:42 <Helenah>	Well application-specific computing can require realtime priorities depending on what the application is.
Mar 02 10:53:53 <louipc>	qnx used to sound cool but then blackberry ruined it
Mar 02 10:54:19 <louipc>	they don't even use it on their latest phones. they just made an android fork
Mar 02 10:54:24 <louipc>	how dumb is that
Mar 02 10:54:29 <agent314_>	apparently cisco has for some reason moved its switches from the best operating system in the world -- IOS to something QNX based
Mar 02 10:54:41 <Helenah>	I disagree that realtime priorities are good for all. I often have to switch to and from a realtime kernel.
Mar 02 10:54:56 <agent314_>	oh wow it is developed by blackberry
Mar 02 10:55:03 <agent314_>	is that what they've been doing all this time?
Mar 02 10:55:05 <louipc>	agent314_: it was bought out by them
Mar 02 10:55:07 <agent314_>	*this
Mar 02 10:55:16 <agent314_>	blackberry hsa money to buy things??
Mar 02 10:55:27 <louipc>	it had enough when they bought qnx
Mar 02 10:55:40 <louipc>	long time ago
Mar 02 10:55:53 <agent314_>	blackbery has $2.5 billion in assets in 2022??
Mar 02 10:56:06 <agent314_>	does that mean in blackberries?
Mar 02 10:56:06 <louipc>	could be
Mar 02 10:56:15 <fb`>	wince had its day too. in all kinds of random hardware
Mar 02 10:56:33 <EdFletcher>	Helenah: you're right; we mix both default-scheduled and RT-scheduled processes in production and must be careful about it because too much in the RT scheduler can starve the default
Mar 02 10:56:39 <agent314_>	they should do an epic move
Mar 02 10:56:57 <agent314_>	and abandon IT entirely, focusing solely on blackberries
Mar 02 10:57:00 <Helenah>	EdFletcher: Yep.
Mar 02 10:57:03 <Helenah>	EdFletcher gets it.
Mar 02 10:57:25 <Helenah>	And for those of you who blatantly opt to use real time without thinking: https://bellmar.medium.com/stop-using-real-time-wrong-8b1bbcd7b655
Mar 02 10:57:47 <Helenah>	It's important you know its cons and not just its pros and don't read too literally into the name.
Mar 02 10:58:30 <agent314_>	how much can one minify linux?
Mar 02 10:58:49 <louipc>	Helenah: what about the name
Mar 02 10:59:11 <louipc>	oh i know its not about latency. it's about determinism
Mar 02 10:59:39 <nigalicious>	determine if one is a slave or not
Mar 02 10:59:42 <AndyCap>	agent314_: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9CClinux
Mar 02 10:59:58 <Helenah>	louipc: Like I said, you don't read into it literally.
Mar 02 11:00:03 <agent314_>	AndyCap:  YES!
Mar 02 11:00:07 <agent314_>	that's what i was looking for
Mar 02 11:00:17 <agent314_>	also what's wrong with  my...
Mar 02 11:01:17 <Helenah>	When people take the term "realtime" literally, they think of the clock in real life, and how fast things are in the real world compared to the lag that can happen within a computer system and they're like "Ah, I can achieve zero latency", truth is, a computer will ALWAYS be latent.
Mar 02 11:01:30 <Artfaith>	If you need anything modern, I would suggest https://github.com/bitnami/minideb\
Mar 02 11:01:59 <Helenah>	So STOP promoting real time stuff unless you know it's needed for what you're promoting it for, you're just gonna give people a hard time.
Mar 02 11:02:05 <AndyCap>	Helenah: no, computers are quite evident :p
Mar 02 11:02:10 <agent314>	when we worked on like an avatar "chat" R&D for natal
Mar 02 11:02:30 <AndyCap>	Helenah: well, then they can run hard-time linux.
Mar 02 11:02:47 <agent314>	there was a library that basically combined network communication and anatomical prediction
Mar 02 11:03:37 <Artfaith>	agent314, for the mini Linux I meant above.
Mar 02 11:03:58 <nigalicious38>	no
Mar 02 11:04:02 <agent314>	i was just mesmorized by the concept at the time
Mar 02 11:05:13 <AndyCap>	Artfaith: minideb is something completely different than µcLinux
Mar 02 11:05:17 <nigalicious38>	so like does god hate niggers?
Mar 02 11:05:17 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 02 11:05:18 *	litharge sets ban on $a:Nigalicious
Mar 02 11:05:18 *	litharge has kicked nigalicious from #linux (Discuss your ban in #linux-ops.)
Mar 02 11:05:18 *	litharge has kicked nigalicious38 from #linux (Discuss your ban in #linux-ops.)
Mar 02 11:05:28 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 02 11:05:29 <louipc>	i feel like computers are too loosey goosey with resources
Mar 02 11:05:39 <agent314>	basically because you differential C++ libraries/numbers, you know both first and second derivative of the motion of every joint in the body for the last uptime seconds
Mar 02 11:05:46 <agent314>	*use differential
Mar 02 11:05:50 <louipc>	so i like the realtime idea
Mar 02 11:05:51 <agent314>	*derivatives
Mar 02 11:06:07 <Artfaith>	AndyCap, I believe so. The question was about "minified Linux"
Mar 02 11:06:16 <Helenah>	Well you mentioned determinism, louipc, so you're on the right path.
Mar 02 11:06:28 <louipc>	yea
Mar 02 11:06:43 <AntonoiCarpio>	are computers deterministic?
Mar 02 11:06:44 <agent314>	and because there are all these hierarchical restraints you can essentially have latency of 0 ms when seeing somebody move
Mar 02 11:06:46 <Artfaith>	This one always worked in my cases.
Mar 02 11:07:05 <AntonoiCarpio>	are computers deterministics but chaotic? or are computers chaotic but not deterministic?
Mar 02 11:07:20 <louipc>	depends on what level you're talking
Mar 02 11:07:36 <louipc>	did you ever have a single program go crazy and lock up your computer?
Mar 02 11:07:40 <Helenah>	AntonoiCarpio: No, they're not deterministic, they're literal, you can however code algorithms that achieve some form of determination.
Mar 02 11:07:45 <Helenah>	And even predictability.
Mar 02 11:07:52 <agent314>	i think they were trying to use like infrared depth perception of kinect to make a chat where then using all the stuff i described above you could have like a 0 latency chat with somebody
Mar 02 11:08:02 <louipc>	thats evidence of non determinism
Mar 02 11:08:21 <louipc>	i'm sure that no one intended the program or the system to do that
Mar 02 11:08:50 <louipc>	even if the program intended to like a virus or worm. then the system should have handled it better
Mar 02 11:09:05 <Helenah>	And that's all this real time stuff is, a set of algorithms.
Mar 02 11:09:21 <agent314>	this makes me all think of CPU branch prediction
Mar 02 11:09:21 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 02 11:09:22 *	litharge removes ban on *!~Alexey@95.165.151.*
Mar 02 11:09:22 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 02 11:09:40 <louipc>	heuheuhe
Mar 02 11:09:46 <agent314>	and in general speculative execution
Mar 02 11:09:55 <rexar89>	 if you have a complex task that involves executing various commands and interacting with multiple systems. do you find it feasible to have a script(say python) that  does all the steps and report on any failures and also does clenup if ncessary or  document the procedure step by step for someone to execute manually ?
Mar 02 11:10:24 <AndyCap>	rexar89: yes.
Mar 02 11:11:24 *	agent314 snapped out of his like monologue echo-chamber
Mar 02 11:12:00 <agent314>	rexar89: what does it mean?
Mar 02 11:12:18 <louipc>	never python
Mar 02 11:12:27 <rexar89>	pythonwas just an example
Mar 02 11:12:33 <agent314>	Python is like not the best
Mar 02 11:12:36 <louipc>	:p
Mar 02 11:12:38 <agent314>	but it's what we got
Mar 02 11:12:47 <louipc>	i know rexar89 lol
Mar 02 11:13:44 *	agent314 personally prefers lisp/scheme to python
Mar 02 11:13:59 <rexar89>	i was just speaking to an older system admin and he stated that is he would  document step by step the invividual  commands  a person would need to execute and what to look for ,etc... I would normall create script to handle all that  with command  arguments varying  execution if needed
Mar 02 11:14:25 <rexar89>	so from a system admin perspective what would be best
Mar 02 11:14:54 <louipc>	yea that is good for understanding the underlying mechanisms
Mar 02 11:15:10 <Artfaith>	rexar89, there are Sphynx and such like https://www.doxygen.nl/
Mar 02 11:15:16 <louipc>	it should be documented
Mar 02 11:15:26 <louipc>	the script should be a secondary tool
Mar 02 11:15:51 <louipc>	unless you're one of those guys that wants to keep all the keys to the castle
Mar 02 11:16:02 <louipc>	and not let anyone else know how stuff works
Mar 02 11:16:08 <fb`>	put comments in the script though, everywhere
Mar 02 11:16:16 <ananke>	rexar89: 'best' is relative. if you had to start from scratch, a configuration management system would be more apt, combined with automated install
Mar 02 11:16:17 <louipc>	which i find tremendously rude
Mar 02 11:16:18 <rexar89>	yep commends are in the sripts
Mar 02 11:17:29 <fb`>	perhaps something like ansible if you are looking to automate sysadmin tasks
Mar 02 11:18:11 <ananke>	if it's a case of an existing system, documentation in a form of comments + code would be good, as long as they're in a consitent format
Mar 02 11:18:12 <rexar89>	ok
Mar 02 11:18:43 <ZAJDAN>	is possible check size of device via /dev/disk/by-path ?
Mar 02 11:18:43 <agent314>	i think we'll see APL motives in the next mainstream scripting language
Mar 02 11:19:10 <agent314>	ZAJDAN: i usually like to calipers to measure the size of a device
Mar 02 11:19:38 <louipc>	yea i guess if you can make code the documentation then that works
Mar 02 11:19:55 <louipc>	there are some tools to do that
Mar 02 11:20:20 <louipc>	doxygen and such
Mar 02 11:20:38 <ExclamationPoint>	ZAJDAN, why would you do that?
Mar 02 11:20:44 <rexar89>	louipc: I document code just so the next person can understand what it does
Mar 02 11:21:21 <rexar89>	i never heard of doxygen . looking at it now it looks like a good tool
Mar 02 11:21:58 <AndyCap>	doxygen sucks.
Mar 02 11:22:08 <ZAJDAN>	ExclamationPoint: want to know just if it is possible
Mar 02 11:22:19 <AndyCap>	it lets shitty developers produce tons of "documentation" that is completely useless
Mar 02 11:22:20 <ananke>	a directory of markdown documents + scripts would be sufficient
Mar 02 11:22:28 <Blacknessman>	ɹǝƃƃᴉu
Mar 02 11:22:30 <fb`>	ZAJDAN `df -h` provides some info
Mar 02 11:22:36 <skdnn>	can you use ISOs for legacy installations?
Mar 02 11:22:38 <ExclamationPoint>	ZAJDAN, it depends on the device type but even if it is, never do it that way
Mar 02 11:22:47 <rexar89>	AndyCap: what tools do you use for documentation ?
Mar 02 11:22:47 <ananke>	AndyCap: seems that's blaming the tool on how it's used. unfair a bit
Mar 02 11:22:50 <louipc>	AndyCap: is there a better one
Mar 02 11:23:02 <agent314>	ZAJDAN: you can go also cd /dev/disk/by-path then do something like sudo smartctl --info pci-0000:00:17.0-ata-2.0-part5
Mar 02 11:23:11 <skdnn>	booting in the efi mode prevents some installers from working
Mar 02 11:23:26 <AndyCap>	ananke: considering I see far more bad uses of doxygen and the like than good, I'm willing to blame the tool. :)
Mar 02 11:23:35 <agent314>	i did ls -la to figure out where those links are pointing
Mar 02 11:23:40 <ZAJDAN>	fb`: 'df -h'uses /dev/sd* and in my case after each boot it is reordered
Mar 02 11:24:12 <ananke>	AndyCap: that's ass backwards and you know it
Mar 02 11:24:24 <agent314>	what do you mean reordered? we are dealing with SSDs here, just as a sanity check, right?
Mar 02 11:24:31 <agent314>	or HDDs
Mar 02 11:24:42 <ExclamationPoint>	skdnn, EFI and MBR boot can coexist on install media. not sure about ISO9660 but it can be done
Mar 02 11:24:55 <agent314>	i guess it has to be ssds
Mar 02 11:25:01 <ZAJDAN>	fb`: and shows only formated devices. I have next 3 disk unformated
Mar 02 11:25:05 <fb`>	ZAJDAN yes df is more general purpose. so you are looking only for the storage size of a disk under /dev?
Mar 02 11:25:34 <ZAJDAN>	fb`:yes
Mar 02 11:25:56 <skdnn>	I looked at the iso and it has a boot sector inserted at the beginning
Mar 02 11:26:19 <fb`>	ZAJDAN `fdisk -l /dev/disk`
Mar 02 11:26:22 <ExclamationPoint>	ZAJDAN, have you tried lsblk? and /proc/diskstats ?
Mar 02 11:27:12 <ExclamationPoint>	skdnn, that should mean it's MBR bootable
Mar 02 11:27:41 <Blacknessman>	excellent discussion everyone but I must ask...
Mar 02 11:27:46 <Blacknessman>	does god hate nіggеrѕ?
Mar 02 11:28:05 <ExclamationPoint>	Blacknessman, God doesn't hate
Mar 02 11:32:24 <wantyapps>	Gotta go! Seeya in a couple
Mar 02 11:36:03 <Helenah>	I got up this morning, went to light the gas on my frankenstein gas supply and it made a load blowing sound like oxygen so I shut it off, disassembled the endpoint I lit, checked out the integrity, then put it all back together, I did feel gas when I went to shut off the valve though...
Mar 02 11:36:52 <lopid>	ok
Mar 02 11:38:42 <gog>	my cat woke me this morning
Mar 02 11:38:46 <gog>	his bowls were empty
Mar 02 11:39:44 <louipc>	oh i thought you wrote bowels for a second
Mar 02 11:44:19 <buraq>	skdnn: you can even configure grub to boot the same iso image in both bios and uefi modes
Mar 02 11:51:04 <buraq>	skdnn: it takes some preparation of course before booting
Mar 02 11:52:04 <louipc>	why would you use both modes
Mar 02 11:52:31 <gog>	usually it's for install and live media
Mar 02 11:52:35 <OwlWizard>	morning
Mar 02 11:52:43 <gog>	pretty sure all major distros do it
Mar 02 11:52:53 <ExclamationPoint>	louipc, to make a disk that boots on both platform bootstrap types so you can install it on legacy and current machines
Mar 02 11:53:25 <louipc>	tru
Mar 02 11:53:43 <buraq>	louipc: because i can
Mar 02 11:57:38 <ExclamationPoint>	what would be cool is if you can make a hypervisor to boot long mode and start an x86 VM and patch UEFI calls to BIOS calls and then have DOS running on UEFI. I don't think it's possible in UEFI boot mode
Mar 02 11:58:47 <louipc>	yea
Mar 02 12:07:27 <a51>	greetings distinguished linux affocinado, sipping coffee, wish all a great day/evening
Mar 02 12:07:44 <louipc>	salutations
Mar 02 12:08:09 <agent314>	helo
Mar 02 12:08:10 <agent314>	hello
Mar 02 12:08:33 <EmiF10>	Hi
Mar 02 12:08:58 <ExclamationPoint>	a51, welcome home!
Mar 02 12:09:23 <EmiF10>	Show me what I've missed
Mar 02 12:11:18 <EmiF10>	Linix.social<emimorris10@gmail.com>
Mar 02 12:11:32 <a51>	How is life treating you all, I hope great
Mar 02 12:12:11 <gog>	hi
Mar 02 12:12:49 <gog>	linuks
Mar 02 12:12:50 <a51>	is life fair ? I was reading Tech billionnaire buying properties in Hawaii while average lad can
Mar 02 12:13:00 <a51>	can't afford to travel to hawaii
Mar 02 12:13:26 <gog>	that's not really a linux topic
Mar 02 12:14:15 <EmiF10>	Not sure how to use
Mar 02 12:14:17 <EmiF10>	Yet
Mar 02 12:19:26 <ExclamationPoint>	a51, free software is fair
Mar 02 12:19:54 <a51>	the thing is, Hawaii will be reserved for high income folks in a few years, and by that time it will be too late
Mar 02 12:20:44 <a51>	ExclamationPoint: the person buying properties on Hawaii is salesforce ceo marc beniof (10 billion $) net worth
Mar 02 12:21:40 <ExclamationPoint>	a51, wanna PM me? I don't think the chat is on topic, but I'll talk in PMs if you want to continue the conversation
Mar 02 12:31:03 *	wantyapps slaps wantyapps around a bit with a large basslet
Mar 02 13:05:23 <OwlWizard>	btw is anyone else frustrated whit how motherboard makers deal with pcie?
Mar 02 13:06:57 <danza_>	we should only buy hardware with linux installed
Mar 02 13:08:22 <joo>	how do they deal with that? motherboard manufactureres and i are find as long as they dont put that crap rst on the board
Mar 02 13:08:47 <blebz>	12dana_ What about a hair dryer?
Mar 02 13:10:26 <OwlWizard>	as an example i have a motherboard with 2 16x slots. however only 1 of them is wired for 16x. also with am5 you can have either 1 pcie gen5 16x slot or 2 full gen 4 slots. no manufacturer gives you 2 gen 4 slots eventhough consumers dont have a need for pcie gen 5
Mar 02 13:10:41 <OwlWizard>	also pcie biforcation is rarely supported
Mar 02 13:12:36 <blebz>	Hair-dryer-tron 4000
Mar 02 13:13:09 <joo>	not sure their target audience even knows whats the difference between gen 4 and gen 5 or what 16x is
Mar 02 13:13:33 <tripstah>	new version of projectm released! a visualizer for windows/macos/linux/android: https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/releases/tag/v4.1.0
Mar 02 13:14:51 <OwlWizard>	joo, im saddly aware. what i want is a am5 µatx mainboard with 2 full pcie x16 slots with bifurcation and all m.2 pcie being put together into a third pcie slot
Mar 02 13:16:24 <joo>	maybe it exists, they will definitely know in #hardware
Mar 02 13:18:40 <OwlWizard>	joo, ill try there
Mar 02 13:18:42 <joo>	will dd if=/dev/zero of=harddisk effectively selfdestruct a linux machine ?
Mar 02 13:19:18 <wantyapps>	joo: absolutely
Mar 02 13:19:28 <wantyapps>	Done this myself
Mar 02 13:20:47 <joo>	yeah but i mean effectively like if i have a virtualbox on a luksfs where the password is known, the data will not be able to be recovered ? i think it may take some time, so i wonder if there is a faster way to render a luksfs useless
Mar 02 13:21:02 <joo>	virtualbox=qemu
Mar 02 13:21:30 <wantyapps>	joo: I don't believe the data can be restored
Mar 02 13:22:47 <joo>	ok
Mar 02 13:23:56 <joo>	do You require a central point somewhere to send a simple (for example self destruct) command ? or is there another way? syncthing or tor i think is a bit overkill, and as far as i know magic wormhole requires both ends to exchange a secret word
Mar 02 13:24:29 <joo>	so: is there a way to send a simple command from one computer to another without requiring a servce in the middle?
Mar 02 13:28:26 <rudi_s>	joo: If only the passphrase but not the key of a LUKS partition is known, it's enough to wipe the LUKS header.
Mar 02 13:28:35 <rudi_s>	(Which is the first few MB of the LUKS disk.)
Mar 02 13:28:45 <xx>	you can always wipe the luks header
Mar 02 13:28:52 <joo>	ah thats nice
Mar 02 13:29:03 <rudi_s>	man cryptsetup-erase or cat /dev/zero
Mar 02 13:29:18 <rudi_s>	(But this won't help if the attacker has a backup of the encrypted volume obviously.)
Mar 02 13:29:33 <joo>	ah yeah, ofcause
Mar 02 13:30:08 <joo>	then its not really possible to wipe a vm remotely, because they could always have backups
Mar 02 13:32:37 <rudi_s>	Yes
Mar 02 13:33:09 <rudi_s>	(Of course it cannot hurt. But running it in an untrusted environment is problematic from that point of view.)
Mar 02 13:35:18 <eqw>	Failed to connect to session manager: Failed to connect to the session manager: SESSION_MANAGER environment variable not defined
Mar 02 13:36:14 <eqw>	I don't have this variable set on my systems
Mar 02 13:38:53 <ioria>	did you run some 'sudo' command related to X ?
Mar 02 13:39:35 <jasassin>	is anyone here familiar with redhat extreme linux and the licensing? when you "buy" it and you have access to the binaries/source is it legal to mirror it?
Mar 02 13:39:51 <jasassin>	it's all gpl code so it should be right?
Mar 02 13:40:00 <wantyapps>	jasassin: that's in the tos.
Mar 02 13:40:15 <eqw>	ioria: just another user with $DISPLAY and `xhost +local:`. Why?
Mar 02 13:40:24 <MacGyver>	jasassin: Legality is orthogonal to whether Red Hat will still do business with you afterwards.
Mar 02 13:40:34 <wantyapps>	:]
Mar 02 13:41:03 <ioria>	eqw, using sudo sometimes breaks X
Mar 02 13:42:05 <ioria>	eqw,  changes file's ownership
Mar 02 13:42:26 <wantyapps>	eqw: eqw, my client highlights your text in "xhost +local:". Did you do anything to highlight it?
Mar 02 13:43:06 <jasassin>	macgyver: i totally understand what you mean, just terminate your subscription. oh well... i like debian better anyway
Mar 02 13:43:19 <MacGyver>	jasassin: As I understand the situation, it's legal but you get to do it exactly once.
Mar 02 13:43:28 <MacGyver>	jasassin: But I am not a lawyer.
Mar 02 13:43:58 <jasassin>	MacGyver: yeah, you'd have to call the EFF for a lawsuit about that kinda bullshit because i have no clue either
Mar 02 13:44:02 <buraq>	jasassin: what's red hat extreme linux?
Mar 02 13:44:28 <jasassin>	rhel is the commercial "tech support provided" red hat linux
Mar 02 13:44:35 <jasassin>	enteprise linux
Mar 02 13:44:36 <jasassin>	whatever
Mar 02 13:44:52 <jasassin>	redhat can piss off
Mar 02 13:45:02 <buraq>	jasassin: you can read their enterprise agreement and its appendix and then get a lawyer
Mar 02 13:45:04 <jasassin>	or should i say IBM
Mar 02 13:45:23 <jasassin>	does their enterprise agreement override the GPL?
Mar 02 13:45:45 <OwlWizard>	i think ibm basicly found a loophole in the gpl
Mar 02 13:45:57 <buraq>	jasassin: well that's an amazing question, lol
Mar 02 13:46:18 <buraq>	jasassin: they say there's no problem, but the gpl disagrees
Mar 02 13:46:38 <OwlWizard>	also iirc ibm's power10 processors now require a proprietary blob to boot, in contrast to power9 wich could boot with just open source software
Mar 02 13:46:53 <jasassin>	OwlWizard: obviously they have or the EFF would already be herding up the lawyers
Mar 02 13:48:00 <jasassin>	im so sick of the enshitification of everything... if they ruin debian im going to throw the internet away
Mar 02 13:48:26 <eqw>	wantyapps: no
Mar 02 13:48:54 <OwlWizard>	i think the free software conservancy is trying to sue ibm
Mar 02 13:49:13 <OwlWizard>	also more and more people seem to move away from redhat
Mar 02 13:49:17 <djph>	jasassin: how could they ruin it this time?
Mar 02 13:49:55 <eqw>	wantyapps: and it's between backticks, not double quotes
Mar 02 13:50:19 <wantyapps>	Got it
Mar 02 13:50:31 <jasassin>	djph: im sure in some way that makes systemd look like a personally close park day at Disneyland
Mar 02 13:50:44 <Anjor>	If they ruin Debian, we always have Slackware.
Mar 02 13:51:00 <Anjor>	We can Debianize Slackware.
Mar 02 13:51:05 <jasassin>	Anjor: ick
Mar 02 13:51:16 <Anjor>	Old standards die hard.
Mar 02 13:51:25 *	jasassin shudders at the dependancy hell
Mar 02 13:51:45 <jasassin>	i love trying to compile something on slackware...
Mar 02 13:51:48 <OwlWizard>	how would ibm ruin debian?
Mar 02 13:51:58 <jasassin>	lots of cryptic errors from missing libraries
Mar 02 13:52:02 <Anjor>	Lasers. Frickin' lasers.
Mar 02 13:52:04 <wigums>	there is no more dep hell with slackware if you use 3rd party package repos
Mar 02 13:52:05 <jasassin>	i really miss that!
Mar 02 13:52:15 <djph>	jasassin: ha
Mar 02 13:53:41 <jasassin>	wigums: slackware was the first distribution i used. i haven't used it since i found mandrake linux and package managers
Mar 02 13:54:11 <jasassin>	it's good that someone finally made some repositories for slackware
Mar 02 13:54:28 <wigums>	slackware has more package managers than any distro i can think of.. slackpkg sbotools sbopkg rpm2tgz deb2tgz etc etc etc
Mar 02 13:55:16 <jasassin>	back when i was using it there was definitely no packages
Mar 02 13:55:39 <OwlWizard>	i find slackware interesting from a history point of view but i dont know if i want to use it
Mar 02 13:55:56 <wigums>	i slackware all the things. its all i run
Mar 02 13:56:25 <jasassin>	debian is the bees knees... especially unstable since it has more hardware support (especially laptop/wifi)
Mar 02 13:57:11 <jasassin>	what desktop do you use wigums (if you use one)
Mar 02 13:57:14 <katia>	https://repology.org/graph/map_repo_size_fresh.svg
Mar 02 13:57:22 <wigums>	kde atm
Mar 02 13:57:37 <peac>	jasassin: i3
Mar 02 13:57:40 <wigums>	i use kde and xfce but mostly kde these days
Mar 02 13:57:57 <Anjor>	I haven't liked KDE since KDE3
Mar 02 13:58:51 <joo>	is laptop support the same in debian and ubuntu today?
Mar 02 13:59:06 <joo>	meaning proprietary drivers for this and that
Mar 02 13:59:52 <peac>	debian does not include anything proprietary afaik
Mar 02 14:00:12 <joo>	i mean the nonfree iso with the drivers
Mar 02 14:00:41 <Anjor>	https://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq.html
Mar 02 14:02:06 <joo>	Unofficial non-free images including firmware packages UPDATE 10 Jun 2023: As of Debian 12 (Bookworm), firmware is included in the normal Debian installer images. USERS NO LONGER NEED TO LOOK FOR SPECIAL VERSIONS HERE.
Mar 02 14:03:46 <OwlWizard>	im honestly ok with the firmware
Mar 02 14:04:04 <OwlWizard>	not that its proprietary but that you donr have to search for a special version
Mar 02 14:06:40 <Anjor>	If I don't have to use a floppy to install it, I don't want it.
Mar 02 14:08:32 <joo>	to be fair, the use of zip drives to load the driver is also an option
Mar 02 14:09:09 <joo>	then you can load the drivers for your scsi controller and your network adapter in one joint effort. ofcause the zip driver is on a floppy that must be loaded first
Mar 02 14:09:24 <mlu>	machine is too old to have USB I imagine?
Mar 02 14:09:39 <peac>	principles
Mar 02 14:15:54 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Mar 02 14:16:42 <joo>	On behalf of all: Hi
Mar 02 14:17:01 <wantyapps>	Hehe
Mar 02 14:17:04 <peac>	thanks for porting our voice to the world
Mar 02 14:18:17 <dostoyevsky2>	I am writing my own mail reader, and was wondering what would be a safe way to view pdf files...  maybe something like converting the pdf to something else and then converting it back, hoping it might strip malicious javascript
Mar 02 14:18:38 <dostoyevsky2>	or only open pdf files in the browser with pdf.js
Mar 02 14:18:55 <louipc>	wow cool dostoyevsky2 is it on github
Mar 02 14:19:06 <peac>	dostoyevsky2: how advanced are you ? i started that some time ago but don't have time to work on it currently
Mar 02 14:19:27 <louipc>	dostoyevsky2: yea i've heard pdf.js is fairly safe
Mar 02 14:19:30 <wantyapps>	dostoyevsky2: if it's not web-based, you can use minimal pdf refers such as zathura
Mar 02 14:19:44 <wantyapps>	And pdfjs is awesome and secure
Mar 02 14:20:11 <louipc>	dostoyevsky2: you could do like mutt and let people choose their own viewer. but a pdf.js default implementation would be good
Mar 02 14:20:34 <louipc>	or i guess other readers just base it on OS settings..
Mar 02 14:20:34 <joo>	what if you run pdf2ps, and then the other way around? (i didnt know you could put javascripts in pdf files... - except ofcause You can embed all sorts of stuff inthere, but not to be run)
Mar 02 14:21:12 <wantyapps>	louipc: yup yup! I use (neo)mutt everyday, and that type of interface is very friendly.
Mar 02 14:21:38 <xx>	dostoyevsky2: https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2013/02/21/converting-untrusted-pdfs-into-trusted.html
Mar 02 14:21:42 <dostoyevsky2>	peac: I started with it when GMail announced that they stop supporting the basic html view... so I cloned it into to a Go program with a similar UI... I'd say I am 70% done... adding threading support atm
Mar 02 14:22:20 <louipc>	interesting
Mar 02 14:22:29 <wantyapps>	Very
Mar 02 14:25:48 <dostoyevsky2>	Go has all these libraries that do the mail parsing, charset converting, mime decoding and imap client stuff + oauth for you... so that makes it pretty easy to write
Mar 02 14:33:50 <dostoyevsky2>	I guess I could convert the pdf to ps and then convert it back to pdf again... that should strip all the javascript whilst keeping the formatting and embedded images
Mar 02 14:35:21 <joo>	that should definitely do the job
Mar 02 14:38:40 <hodapp>	whatever engine would be doing the PDF to PS (Ghostscript? Poppler?), why not just render it directly from that and bypass the Postscript?
Mar 02 14:39:46 <peac>	dostoyevsky2: nice, i had the same kind of approach.
Mar 02 14:40:05 <dostoyevsky2>	hodapp: I'd like to archive pdfs from email, e.g. bills... and then don't want to have to worry that it might have malicious content...
Mar 02 14:40:45 <elektrinis>	hi
Mar 02 14:41:07 <elektrinis>	I'm cloning NVMEs one to another with dd, and it's painfully slow, 33MB/s
Mar 02 14:41:14 <elektrinis>	I set bs=4M
Mar 02 14:41:30 <elektrinis>	I see CPU load is high
Mar 02 14:41:44 <elektrinis>	any way to speed this up?
Mar 02 14:43:54 <dostoyevsky2>	peac: I also like to be able to view email with any html stripped, so one can't fake websites for phishing anymore, like it happens from time to time in gmail.  Also, no tracking since my email viewer won't load images or the like.  Gmail uses a proxy for images, but you can just create unique image urls and do the tracking that way
Mar 02 14:44:36 <dostoyevsky2>	peac: Also links are just displayed in plaintext, you have to c&p them to open them
Mar 02 14:45:28 <louipc>	wantyapps: whats special about neomutt vs mutt that you know of
Mar 02 14:46:50 <wantyapps>	louipc: mostly how it parses config files, and more config options. I.E more colors, keybindings, etc.
Mar 02 14:47:01 <louipc>	i feel like mutt codebase grew too much :p they added mta features
Mar 02 14:47:28 <louipc>	hmm yea mutt configs can be weird
Mar 02 14:47:38 <louipc>	when managing multiple accounts
Mar 02 14:47:54 <wantyapps>	louipc: MTA?
Mar 02 14:48:14 <louipc>	mail transfer agent aka pop,imap
Mar 02 14:48:21 <wantyapps>	Got it
Mar 02 14:48:30 <louipc>	it was supposed to be separate!
Mar 02 14:48:42 <wantyapps>	Yeah, I guess you are right.
Mar 02 14:49:26 <louipc>	yea modularity
Mar 02 15:03:17 <militantorc>	Is there a historical reason for the default of not including command invocations starting with spaces in the bash history?
Mar 02 15:04:01 <ayecee>	yes. someone thought it would be a good idea, and added the feature.
Mar 02 15:04:05 <wantyapps>	I think it started as a bug in the first version of bash, and stuck as a feature
Mar 02 15:04:10 <wantyapps>	ayecee: really?
Mar 02 15:05:01 <ayecee>	it's especially useful when you need to run a command with, like, a password as an argument
Mar 02 15:05:18 <wantyapps>	ayecee: yea
Mar 02 15:05:43 <jasassin>	i don't have my debian machine here... do they have a package for the Nyxt browser?
Mar 02 15:06:16 <ayecee>	do you have a web browser? packages.debian.org got your back.
Mar 02 15:06:39 <MarkTheShark>	connected at 0.0336 GB/s
Mar 02 15:06:40 <jasassin>	ok!
Mar 02 15:06:47 <jasassin>	thanks ayecee
Mar 02 15:06:57 <ayecee>	:)
Mar 02 15:06:57 <MarkTheShark>	is this a good internet connection or is it too slow?
Mar 02 15:07:07 <wantyapps>	:)
Mar 02 15:07:19 <peac>	it's perfect for irc
Mar 02 15:07:25 <louipc>	good idea
Mar 02 15:07:36 <MarkTheShark>	perfect
Mar 02 15:07:44 <jasassin>	300 baud modem probably work for irc
Mar 02 15:07:49 <louipc>	fine for irc or telnet lol
Mar 02 15:07:58 <MarkTheShark>	what gamnes can I play via Dial-UP on windows 98?
Mar 02 15:08:07 <MarkTheShark>	(even if this is #linux)
Mar 02 15:08:08 <wantyapps>	louipc: yup
Mar 02 15:08:13 <wantyapps>	MarkTheShark: hahaha
Mar 02 15:08:13 <ayecee>	MarkTheShark: wrong channel buddy
Mar 02 15:08:24 <jasassin>	i dont know about tcp over 300 baud modem
Mar 02 15:08:35 <louipc>	but how stable is the connection
Mar 02 15:08:35 <louipc>	you want a very stable connection for irc
Mar 02 15:09:08 <peac>	jasassin: i don't think there's a timer related issue with tcp, so 1 baud would work ?
Mar 02 15:11:27 <jasassin>	i'd like to see a speed difference between catting a file dialed right into the getty.... and the other running pppd sshing into the host and catting the same file
Mar 02 15:12:28 <jasassin>	on a 300 baud modem i wonder if there would be much of a difference
Mar 02 15:12:30 <ayecee>	it'd be slower, but not like super slower.
Mar 02 15:12:56 <rascul>	we had 2400 baud modems by the time irc came to be
Mar 02 15:13:05 <rascul>	well, some of us
Mar 02 15:13:05 <louipc>	what if u increase ur tty speed
Mar 02 15:13:12 <ayecee>	you, not u, please.
Mar 02 15:13:21 <louipc>	y
Mar 02 15:13:26 <ayecee>	kind of a thing here.
Mar 02 15:13:37 <wantyapps>	Huh
Mar 02 15:13:46 <ayecee>	i realize it's unusual.
Mar 02 15:14:01 <wantyapps>	Never really used that type of “lazy” typing
Mar 02 15:14:10 <jasassin>	i was stuck on 1200 baud, but it was fine for c64 and bbs's... i had to get a pc for linux (and wing commander ii)
Mar 02 15:14:22 <louipc>	i flip back and forth
Mar 02 15:14:39 <louipc>	yo its internets speak
Mar 02 15:14:48 <louipc>	and if you understand my meaning then why get all wrapped up about it
Mar 02 15:15:17 <louipc>	that's the only point of language. to express ideas. if theres no misunderstanding then theres no problem
Mar 02 15:15:17 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 02 15:15:18 *	litharge sets quiet on $a:louipc
Mar 02 15:15:28 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 02 15:15:29 <ayecee>	like i said, it's kind of a thing here.
Mar 02 15:15:32 <ayecee>	it's a local custom.
Mar 02 15:15:43 <jasassin>	the thing that amazed me about linux is how you could throw things into the background and login as many users as you want there were two things that i had a hard time wrapping my head around
Mar 02 15:16:01 <ayecee>	louipc: it'll expire in a couple minutes. just wanted your attention.
Mar 02 15:16:13 <jasassin>	the big one was instead of d: there were device ficles and you mount the drive somewhere on the filesystem.... that tripped me out
Mar 02 15:16:57 <peac>	linux is a beautiful thing indeed
Mar 02 15:16:59 <buraq>	jasassin: you can mount stuff in ntfs dirs too
Mar 02 15:18:00 <rascul>	you can put anything in the background by just turning around
Mar 02 15:18:02 <jasassin>	buraq: what i really like is how new debian automounts usb's and stuff when i use the file browser instead of having to manually mount it (finding device names is a pita)
Mar 02 15:18:20 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 02 15:18:21 *	litharge removes quiet on $a:louipc
Mar 02 15:18:21 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 02 15:18:27 <peac>	hence why it's useful to have a rotating seat
Mar 02 15:18:51 <Guest39>	hi
Mar 02 15:19:26 <peac>	jasassin: this is not linked to debian directly but to the file manager you're using
Mar 02 15:19:36 <pell_>	what peac said
Mar 02 15:19:41 <jasassin>	ah!
Mar 02 15:20:09 <wantyapps>	Nice to see you back peac!
Mar 02 15:20:18 <jasassin>	does anyone else here have problems with slow cifs mounts?
Mar 02 15:20:25 <peac>	i've been here for years, just silent
Mar 02 15:20:31 <wantyapps>	:)
Mar 02 15:20:36 <ayecee>	what would you ask someone with slow cifs mounts
Mar 02 15:20:40 <pell_>	Linux Mint does automount and it was a pain. I have a backup device that I want mounted in a particular place. I never hot around to configuring all that before I left Mint again
Mar 02 15:20:51 <jasassin>	has it always been slow?
Mar 02 15:20:53 <peac>	also coming here really impacts my productivity but well i like it
Mar 02 15:21:15 <wantyapps>	I don’t know how y’all get 15d uptime.. though I do disconnect from computer and move to phone when going to campus..
Mar 02 15:21:22 <jasassin>	i probably wouldn't ask them anything, but at least i'd know it's not just me
Mar 02 15:21:46 <ayecee>	in this great world, your problems are not unique.
Mar 02 15:21:57 <jasassin>	who knows...
Mar 02 15:22:13 <jasassin>	tell that to a melting snowflake i guess
Mar 02 15:22:21 <buraq>	in this world, people give you problems
Mar 02 15:22:32 <ayecee>	truth
Mar 02 15:22:46 <ayecee>	well and also some of the smarter primates
Mar 02 15:22:58 <no_gravity>	Hello! Can a terminal script access the terminal's last lines? That would be super useful, for example to write the output of the last command into a file and then look at it in vim.
Mar 02 15:23:17 <ayecee>	no_gravity: nope!
Mar 02 15:23:26 <wantyapps>	no_gravity: the last commands are usually stored in a history file..
Mar 02 15:23:26 <pell_>	wantyapps: I've been logging otu every time. No real reason to stay on unless I want to see what people were talking about before I join again
Mar 02 15:23:36 <peac>	you could have a bashrc that preloads something to allow that
Mar 02 15:23:38 <jasassin>	no_gravity: tail
Mar 02 15:23:42 <wantyapps>	pell_: gotcha
Mar 02 15:23:51 <ayecee>	the history file is updated when the shell exits
Mar 02 15:23:51 <jasassin>	?
Mar 02 15:23:59 <wantyapps>	ayecee: ohhh yeah
Mar 02 15:24:00 <ayecee>	not on each command
Mar 02 15:24:09 <no_gravity>	wantyapps: I don't mean the commands. I meant the last lines printed to the terminal.
Mar 02 15:24:14 <peac>	there may be a way using gnu screen also
Mar 02 15:24:27 <no_gravity>	jasassin: How is tail related to it?
Mar 02 15:24:42 <ayecee>	oh! maybe.
Mar 02 15:24:51 <ayecee>	no_gravity: for tailing the history file.
Mar 02 15:25:02 <no_gravity>	ayecee: What is "the history file"?
Mar 02 15:25:09 <peac>	relative to your term
Mar 02 15:25:16 <pell_>	no_gravity: you mean output before the script ran or during its execution?
Mar 02 15:25:23 <ayecee>	no_gravity: like ~/.bash_history
Mar 02 15:25:32 <peac>	bash history only stores commands
Mar 02 15:25:35 <peac>	not responses
Mar 02 15:25:44 <no_gravity>	ayecee: That only holds the executed commands.
Mar 02 15:25:48 <peac>	and it's updated when you close the term
Mar 02 15:25:53 <ayecee>	right. i'm explaining how tail was related. i'm not saying it addresses the problem.
Mar 02 15:26:13 <peac>	if your terminal stores history in a file you could tail it
Mar 02 15:26:17 <no_gravity>	pell_: Say I did "rm -v *" and afterwards think "Hmm.. I would like to look at the list of deleted files in vim".
Mar 02 15:26:35 <peac>	otherwise i think gnu screen would be the way to go. used to have it in bashrc to always be in a screen session
Mar 02 15:26:47 <pell_>	no_gravity: you can redirect output to a file or to another command
Mar 02 15:26:52 <no_gravity>	pell_: How do you access the content of a screen window?
Mar 02 15:27:34 <no_gravity>	pell_: Sure, but I often decide *after* I executed the command that I would like to have the output in a file.
Mar 02 15:28:02 <no_gravity>	The last lines are obviously stored somewhere. Since I can scroll up and down.
Mar 02 15:28:16 <pell_>	no_gravity: redirect it with the command... rm -v file > rm_output.txt
Mar 02 15:28:22 <no_gravity>	pell_: Sure, but I often decide *after* I executed the command that I would like to have the output in a file.
Mar 02 15:28:22 <ayecee>	in the terminal program, but not in the shell
Mar 02 15:28:52 <no_gravity>	ayecee: Sure. But if the terminal program had a way to tell it "Give me your buffer", that would be awesome.
Mar 02 15:28:59 <ayecee>	maybe there's a way to get terminal buffer contents through some escape sequence, but i don't know one offhand.
Mar 02 15:29:10 <peac>	no_gravity: could be stored in ram
Mar 02 15:29:21 <ayecee>	or rom, right?
Mar 02 15:29:34 <pell_>	maybe readline keeps a cache? that may be worth looking into. or maybe your terminal emulator does
Mar 02 15:29:35 <peac>	or floppy
Mar 02 15:29:45 <ayecee>	or maybe it's stored on post-it notes furiously scribbled by a gerbil.
Mar 02 15:30:00 <ayecee>	no, readline wouldn't cache that.
Mar 02 15:30:13 <peac>	are you on spice or something ?
Mar 02 15:30:20 <pell_>	I know there's a cache somewhere because you can scroll back
Mar 02 15:30:28 <ayecee>	yeah. it's in the terminal program.
Mar 02 15:32:11 <no_gravity>	One nice way to make output more user friendly would then be to indent blocks of content. Then the user can close all folds in vim and have a nice overview.
Mar 02 15:32:17 <pell_>	you could always alias or symlink commands to automatically output to an output file when you use them
Mar 02 15:32:27 <wantyapps>	ayecee: not sure. It works in the tty too..
Mar 02 15:32:50 <ayecee>	in the console? yeah. the console is the terminal in that case.
Mar 02 15:33:16 <pell_>	terminal emulators use readline for textual stuff
Mar 02 15:33:27 <pell_>	that's why I suspect readline keeps that cache
Mar 02 15:33:28 <ayecee>	no, shells do.
Mar 02 15:33:35 <wantyapps>	 ayecee exactly.
Mar 02 15:33:35 <ayecee>	terminal emulators don't.
Mar 02 15:33:53 <pell_>	the shell you're running in your terminal emulator is what I mean
Mar 02 15:34:01 <pell_>	but yeah
Mar 02 15:34:52 <JanC>	other programs (can) use readline too
Mar 02 15:35:10 <ayecee>	thanks captain obvious
Mar 02 15:35:22 <ayecee>	but not relevant to this problem
Mar 02 15:35:40 <JanC>	I mean, maybe that confuses people re: shell vs. terminal
Mar 02 15:35:46 <ayecee>	for sure
Mar 02 15:36:29 <ayecee>	no_gravity: if there's a way to get the terminal buffer programmatically, i think it would be specific to the terminal you're using.
Mar 02 15:36:31 <pell_>	I just misspoke, no biggie
Mar 02 15:36:49 <no_gravity>	ayecee: Yeah
Mar 02 15:36:56 <ayecee>	pell_: more like misunderstood.
Mar 02 15:37:23 <ayecee>	still no biggie.
Mar 02 15:38:24 <ayecee>	no_gravity: i thought termcap might have something for that, but while it can move the cursor around the screen, i don't think it can read what's at that point.
Mar 02 15:38:45 <pell_>	I do know the difference. I've compiled shells before, or I'd have no awareness of readline
Mar 02 15:39:06 <no_gravity>	ayecee: It would also have to read what is currently not on screen.
Mar 02 15:39:48 <ayecee>	reckon the buffer is kind of a virtual screen, and what you see is like a viewport onto the bottom of it.
Mar 02 15:40:06 <no_gravity>	Ha, I found a semi-manual way. Konsole has a "select all" menu entry. It lets you copy everything in the buffer, even the invisible parts. So I am able to paste that into vim afterwards.
Mar 02 15:40:17 <ayecee>	slick
Mar 02 15:41:16 <pell_>	no_gravity: if that works for you, why not just scroll back and manually select and copy the line you want
Mar 02 15:41:41 <ayecee>	because this is faster
Mar 02 15:41:44 <JanC>	https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECRQCRA.html can read from the screen (but it's not implemented in all terminals)
Mar 02 15:41:49 <ayecee>	less schlepping around on the scroll bar
Mar 02 15:42:16 <JanC>	maybe there are other optional or terminal-specific ways
Mar 02 15:42:16 <ayecee>	JanC: seems to be a checksum
Mar 02 15:42:19 <no_gravity>	pell_: True, that also works.
Mar 02 15:42:31 <ayecee>	pretty neat though.
Mar 02 15:42:39 <pell_>	no_gravity: I thought you wanted something you could run from a script
Mar 02 15:42:47 <JanC>	ayecee: you can do a 1×1 "checksum"
Mar 02 15:42:48 <no_gravity>	pell_: That would be best.
Mar 02 15:43:03 <no_gravity>	I guess I could the "select all" and "copy" commands to the konsole terminal via a script.
Mar 02 15:43:07 <ayecee>	pell_: did you? why'd you ask about scrolling back?
Mar 02 15:43:11 <no_gravity>	I guess I could send the "select all" and "copy" commands to the konsole terminal via a script.
Mar 02 15:43:11 <JanC>	let's say it can be abused to get characters
Mar 02 15:43:36 <JanC>	it's intended for running test suites
Mar 02 15:43:47 <pell_>	ayecee: because in order to scroll back, the information has to be stored in a cache somewhere, or in memory
Mar 02 15:43:50 <ayecee>	JanC: that's pretty cool
Mar 02 15:44:05 <ayecee>	pell_: i think you've misunderstood my question.
Mar 02 15:44:24 <ayecee>	it's okay. it was rhetorical.
Mar 02 15:44:56 <JanC>	I'm sure screen, tmux, kitty & some other terminals have terminal-specific ways to get content...
Mar 02 15:44:58 <pell_>	if it's stored somewhere, there ought to be a way to access it from a script was my point
Mar 02 15:45:52 <no_gravity>	pell_: And it is. I would expect you can send the "select all" and "copy" commands to the window from a script and then access the clipboard.
Mar 02 15:46:07 <ayecee>	my point was that scrolling back and selecting wouldn't be accessing it from a script.
Mar 02 15:48:03 <JanC>	you could use accessibility APIs to access it in many GUI terminals probably
Mar 02 15:48:33 <JanC>	but that would be rather convoluted & error-prone
Mar 02 15:49:05 <pell_>	ayecee: and my point is that if you're going to take your hand off the keyboard to use your mouse to access a menu item to put it into a file, you could just as easily scroll back and get the exact thing you want
Mar 02 15:49:22 <ayecee>	pell_: aha. so yours was a rhetorical question too.
Mar 02 15:51:11 <ayecee>	we're on the same page now.
Mar 02 15:51:20 <rascul>	i'm on page 12
Mar 02 15:51:43 *	ayecee turns to page 12, but keeps thumb on current page in case it's a trap
Mar 02 15:53:28 <ayecee>	pell_: being in memory, i guess one could maybe pull it out directly with some gdb magic.
Mar 02 15:53:33 <superkuh>	fairway, with mailservers you have to spend a lot of time and effort making sure your IP address has a good reputation. Switching to ipv6 and suddenly sending from a new address can get you added to blacklists.
Mar 02 15:53:59 <ayecee>	superkuh: doesn't seem like an ipv6 specific problem
Mar 02 15:54:28 <keystroke>	join #gentoo
Mar 02 15:54:33 <keystroke>	ls
Mar 02 15:54:37 <pell_>	as long as we're being convoluted
Mar 02 15:54:38 <keystroke>	sorry
Mar 02 15:55:13 <ayecee>	sure. implied by "it's in ram".
Mar 02 15:57:20 <OwlWizard>	is it normal that i need to regain everytime i log in?
Mar 02 15:57:31 <pnbeast>	Regain what?
Mar 02 15:57:33 <ayecee>	what does regain mean here
Mar 02 15:57:41 <OwlWizard>	my nickname
Mar 02 15:57:49 <ayecee>	nope.
Mar 02 15:57:49 <AntonoiCarpio>	i dont get it, why do we need to ask the tty for their output? why not just ask the application directly to pipe their output to the test application?
Mar 02 15:57:50 <pell_>	luca_: did you register?
Mar 02 15:57:57 <OwlWizard>	i registered
Mar 02 15:58:05 <ayecee>	OwlWizard: it's something you'd set up in your irc client.
Mar 02 15:58:05 <pell_>	as OwlWizard?
Mar 02 15:58:16 <OwlWizard>	yup as owlwizard
Mar 02 15:58:22 <Chatpgp>	You have to identify with NickServ or anyone can use your nick.  The End
Mar 02 15:58:24 <OwlWizard>	it still logs me in as luca_
Mar 02 15:58:50 <pnbeast>	You know owls can't be wizards unless they both wisdom and intelligence +2 or higher, right?
Mar 02 15:58:53 <ayecee>	Chatpgp: technically true but practically irrelevant.
Mar 02 15:59:02 <AntonoiCarpio>	well if its a rhetorical question just for the sake of doing a specific step, then meh. I certainly dont want my tty to directly offer their output to another application
Mar 02 15:59:06 <ayecee>	well sure, for _natural_ owls.
Mar 02 15:59:20 <AntonoiCarpio>	dont want it to have that feature*
Mar 02 15:59:24 <ayecee>	so obviously an owl wizard isn't a natural owl.
Mar 02 15:59:29 *	pnbeast hadn't considered an unnatural owl.
Mar 02 15:59:50 <OwlWizard>	i mean do owls usualy speak?
Mar 02 16:00:00 <ayecee>	only when spoken to
Mar 02 16:00:02 <pnbeast>	They're always asking me "who?".
Mar 02 16:00:25 <Matthias1>	Hey, looking for some Ubuntu support. sudo apt-get install libffi-dev gives "no installation candidate", but that seems to be a valid package. On 20.04 LTS
Mar 02 16:00:38 <ayecee>	i wonder if an owl familiar could become a wizard.
Mar 02 16:00:59 <ayecee>	Matthias1: what makes it seem to be a valid package
Mar 02 16:01:04 <Matthias1>	https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libffi-dev
Mar 02 16:01:09 <ayecee>	are you using focal
Mar 02 16:01:13 <AntonoiCarpio>	Matthias1, you should go to #ubuntu?
Mar 02 16:01:24 <ayecee>	AntonoiCarpio: nope
Mar 02 16:01:34 <OwlWizard>	ayecee, maybe when the human wizard dies
Mar 02 16:01:47 <ayecee>	ah, 20.04 is focal. got it.
Mar 02 16:02:13 <keystroke>	I run a gentoo system, and something very weird is happening to my system today. I am stuck in a boot loop, when I power on the system, grub shows up for a millisecond and then the system powers down and opens up the BIOS menu. System information has listed my nvme drive, but to bootmenu doesn't. I am currenty chrooted into the system. The SSD seems to run just fine. I re-installed the kernel, built
Mar 02 16:02:14 <keystroke>	a new initramfs, and updated grub.cfg but the issue persists. What could possibly be happening? I have full disk-encryption and a btrfs filesystem.
Mar 02 16:02:15 <pell_>	Matthias1: is it a virtual package? are there any regular packages?
Mar 02 16:03:03 <ayecee>	Matthias1: seems like it should work. would you be able to pastebin the output of the command, to get a better idea of why
Mar 02 16:03:06 <ayecee>	?
Mar 02 16:03:52 <pell_>	Ubuntu still uses apt-get? Debian has been using just plain apt for a while now
Mar 02 16:04:04 <Matthias1>	https://paste.linux.chat/?be4da4cfaddd1cda#2C7rodD1XtoE5wSW9dDALyucUjeG4uaKH2pdmH7Fq73Q
Mar 02 16:04:09 <ayecee>	debian still has apt-get too.
Mar 02 16:04:22 <Matthias1>	pell_: I think it's aliased and I have muscle memory lol
Mar 02 16:04:42 <pell_>	it's there, but the recommended way is to use apt
Mar 02 16:04:45 <ayecee>	Matthias1: does it help to do an apt-get update first?
Mar 02 16:04:50 <Matthias1>	No
Mar 02 16:04:54 <ayecee>	well shoot.
Mar 02 16:04:56 <pell_>	what ayecee said
Mar 02 16:05:25 *	rascul shoots
Mar 02 16:05:42 <ayecee>	how long is lts support? 3 years, or 5?
Mar 02 16:05:43 <pell_>	Matthias1: an update should be the first thing you do before just about any package manager activities
Mar 02 16:05:46 <Matthias1>	Are these the right repositories for it to be checking https://paste.linux.chat/?854916f9098d257d#CVjDQ8w4wuizDtHVwBp8cBd7DVD1raqcWDxeE5zUBcvj
Mar 02 16:05:48 <plebe>	ahhh aptitude days
Mar 02 16:06:20 <rascul>	Apr 2025 for 20.04
Mar 02 16:06:23 <ayecee>	Matthias1: looks okay
Mar 02 16:06:27 <rascul>	i guess that's five years
Mar 02 16:07:13 <Matthias1>	When I upgrade I'm going to jump off of Ubuntu, not worth it
Mar 02 16:07:13 <pell_>	update and upgrade
Mar 02 16:07:24 <yecin>	ubuntu implemntation of gnome is horrible
Mar 02 16:07:25 <pell_>	???
Mar 02 16:07:27 <Matthias1>	But I have 910 days of uptime
Mar 02 16:07:49 <ayecee>	hmm. is libffi part of main, or universe?
Mar 02 16:07:58 <Matthias1>	Will try an upgrade and see what else it breaks. If that doesn't work I'll ask in #ubuntu
Mar 02 16:07:59 <pnbeast>	You might be missing a useful update or two, if you haven't rebooted in that long.
Mar 02 16:08:17 <jasassin>	!seen bangkow
Mar 02 16:08:29 <ayecee>	Matthias1: do you have the universe source enabled?
Mar 02 16:08:36 <pell_>	Matthias1: you avoid updating to keep your uptime going?
Mar 02 16:08:44 <pnbeast>	!bangnow jasassin
Mar 02 16:08:45 <AntonoiCarpio>	libffi is part of main, so if his copy isnt seeing it, then he might have tainted his package sources somehow
Mar 02 16:08:52 <AntonoiCarpio>	libffi-dev*
Mar 02 16:09:06 <ayecee>	i see. i couldn't tell from the package webpage.
Mar 02 16:09:12 <plebe>	sometimes updates are not worth a reboot
Mar 02 16:09:28 <pell_>	most updates don't require a reboot
Mar 02 16:09:30 <AntonoiCarpio>	ayecee: i could cuz i just checked it on a running vm i have :P
Mar 02 16:09:32 <plebe>	right
Mar 02 16:09:34 <ayecee>	nice
Mar 02 16:09:35 <rascul>	sometimes reboots aren't worth an update
Mar 02 16:09:57 <Matthias1>	This is a VPS; I try to take a hands-off approach as long as it keeps serving my websites
Mar 02 16:10:01 <ayecee>	sometimes reboots are their own reward.
Mar 02 16:10:24 <rascul>	i need to get rebooted my old boots are worn out
Mar 02 16:10:24 <pnbeast>	I've used some operating systems that reward themselves quite liberally.
Mar 02 16:11:01 *	ayecee gets the boot nails and heads to the forge
Mar 02 16:11:01 <pell_>	Matthias1: As long as nothing breaks you'll be down only a minute or so. Lots of DNS servers keep caches anyway
Mar 02 16:11:24 <ayecee>	after 900 some days of uptime, something's going to break.
Mar 02 16:11:43 <plebe>	why would it break?
Mar 02 16:12:21 <ayecee>	changes that had unintended consequences, but the consequences were never realized when the changes were made.
Mar 02 16:12:34 <ayecee>	because the consequence manifested on reboot.
Mar 02 16:12:56 <ayecee>	plebe: i mean, it's no guarantee. it just often happens like that.
Mar 02 16:13:02 <Matthias1>	apt upgrade requires a reboot
Mar 02 16:13:04 <Matthias1>	It's happening
Mar 02 16:13:16 <AntonoiCarpio>	if i have to manage a VPS to run whatever I need to run. I just put Docker in it and just run that crap inside there
Mar 02 16:13:27 <pell_>	plebe: I'm not saying I expect something to break...but it's a possibility
Mar 02 16:13:49 <ayecee>	a possibility that grows with uptime, to the point that you're scared to reboot it.
Mar 02 16:13:55 <rascul>	i'm not
Mar 02 16:14:25 <rascul>	if it breaks then smash it
Mar 02 16:14:26 <rascul>	problem solved
Mar 02 16:14:40 <rascul>	big hammers help
Mar 02 16:14:53 <ayecee>	a solution that creates new problems ;)
Mar 02 16:15:04 <rascul>	yeah but you don't have your old problem anymore
Mar 02 16:15:22 <ayecee>	if a big hammer doesn't solve your problem, get a bigger hammer.
Mar 02 16:15:23 <AntonoiCarpio>	fix 1 problem, 10 more appears
Mar 02 16:15:26 <AntonoiCarpio>	classic
Mar 02 16:18:05 <plebe>	there are times when a lot of big changes happen all at once so I don't see it much different than doing a large update/upgrade
Mar 02 16:18:15 <pell_>	I sometimes forget that the vast majority of Linux users are running servers rather than personal desktops
Mar 02 16:18:59 <plebe>	I updated a debian Stretch desktop to Bookworm with almost zero problems.
Mar 02 16:19:03 <ayecee>	i don't think netcraft has confirmed that
Mar 02 16:19:25 <ayecee>	there's way more linux servers than linux users though.
Mar 02 16:20:46 <Matthias1>	The reboot didn't seem to cause any real issues (one small one I fixed)
Mar 02 16:20:53 <ayecee>	whew
Mar 02 16:21:03 <AntonoiCarpio>	I wonder whats the ratio of gamers and non gamers for linux users that use it on their personal device (like directly installing it on their machine, not via virtualization)
Mar 02 16:21:12 <pell_>	Matthias1: good to hear.
Mar 02 16:22:36 <ayecee>	one would have to come up with a meaning for "gamer". that could be tricky.
Mar 02 16:22:53 <AntonoiCarpio>	lets say the definition is they have steam or wine installed? lol
Mar 02 16:23:07 <plebe>	I can play a mean round of tali
Mar 02 16:23:23 <AntonoiCarpio>	ok im ruling out the tux enthusiasts there but for the sake of generalization
Mar 02 16:23:27 <ayecee>	ah. i guess Valve would have some stats on that.
Mar 02 16:23:28 <rascul>	what if they have wine installed but don't use it for games?
Mar 02 16:23:50 <AntonoiCarpio>	hmmmh, thats.... huh hmmmmh
Mar 02 16:24:04 <pell_>	My impression has been that people mean "player of AAA games"
Mar 02 16:24:09 <ayecee>	i think maybe their number would be small enough to not make a big difference.
Mar 02 16:24:15 <AntonoiCarpio>	yeah
Mar 02 16:24:18 <ayecee>	okay so what does AAA games mean
Mar 02 16:24:20 <AntonoiCarpio>	its probably a rare breed
Mar 02 16:24:32 <rascul>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)
Mar 02 16:24:54 <jasassin>	first person to put that nvidia geforce now into their tv so you can play steam games right from your tv without a console is gonna make some bucks
Mar 02 16:25:08 <jasassin>	plug in an xbox controller and blam
Mar 02 16:25:43 <jasassin>	hell make the tv with bluetooth so it uses wireless sony and xbox controllers
Mar 02 16:25:57 <jasassin>	consoles are doomed
Mar 02 16:26:01 <ayecee>	do linux players of AAA games install them by means other than steam in significant numbers?
Mar 02 16:26:16 <rascul>	jasassin can do that already with android tv
Mar 02 16:26:25 <jasassin>	cool!
Mar 02 16:26:26 <AntonoiCarpio>	valve would probably be extremely happy if tvs would incorporate steam link directly to their smart tv os offerings lmao
Mar 02 16:26:32 <jasassin>	rascul i didn't know that!
Mar 02 16:26:38 <rascul>	ayecee i dunno any numbers but i find steam to be garbage and will get them from gog if available
Mar 02 16:26:39 <Helenah>	I don't know why someone suggested me to "Hairpin NAT" the other day regarding why I can't access my self-hosted website from within the LAN but can from outside the LAN, ALL the public IPs are accessible from within the LAN!
Mar 02 16:26:43 <jasassin>	all my stuff is at least 14 years old
Mar 02 16:26:59 <ayecee>	eh. the chromecast dongle already does steam link. the built in stuff on TVs is so often dated and slow.
Mar 02 16:27:38 <pell_>	i've used Epic and GOG
Mar 02 16:27:39 <ayecee>	Helenah: because hairpin nat would fix that.
Mar 02 16:27:56 <jasassin>	chromecast dongle needs a computer right?
Mar 02 16:28:00 <ayecee>	jasassin: nope
Mar 02 16:28:13 <Helenah>	I still didn't manage to fix the issue but this returns a blank page http://helservers.net/
Mar 02 16:28:26 <Helenah>	ayecee: Would fix a web setup?
Mar 02 16:28:33 <AntonoiCarpio>	its like a wireless display receiver
Mar 02 16:28:38 <AntonoiCarpio>	chromecast dongle
Mar 02 16:28:40 <Helenah>	I thought it was so I could access my public IPs from within the LAN?
Mar 02 16:28:43 <Helenah>	Which I can...
Mar 02 16:28:49 <jasassin>	so how does it get video without a computer?
Mar 02 16:29:04 <jasassin>	like roku menu?
Mar 02 16:29:05 <ayecee>	Helenah: it would fix the problem if the problem was due to a webserver on a private address, and the public address forwarded to it.
Mar 02 16:29:19 <pell_>	Well, Epic. I don't think my GOG games are AAA
Mar 02 16:29:19 <Helenah>	hmm
Mar 02 16:29:27 <ayecee>	jasassin: like a roku, yeah. it's a little computer.
Mar 02 16:29:56 <jasassin>	does chromecast work in linux?
Mar 02 16:29:59 <ayecee>	this thing, https://store.google.com/us/product/chromecast_google_tv
Mar 02 16:30:19 <ayecee>	it's not software, it's hardware
Mar 02 16:30:45 <ayecee>	running android.
Mar 02 16:30:55 <rascul>	how hard is the hardware?
Mar 02 16:31:42 *	rascul digs out his mohs hardness kit
Mar 02 16:31:44 <Helenah>	how soft is the software?
Mar 02 16:32:07 <Helenah>	Is the malware malfunctioning?
Mar 02 16:33:47 <rbox>	rascul: deep grooves at level 4
Mar 02 16:34:23 <rascul>	have you tried an apatite?
Mar 02 16:34:24 *	Khaytsus pokes rascul in the eye
Mar 02 16:34:38 <rascul>	Khaytsus that is not part of the kit!
Mar 02 16:34:51 <jasassin>	"There's a new browser in town: Nyxt. It is free software. It is written in Common Lisp."..... and some guy wrote a comment: A new browther? I don't think thith ith thomething people want.
Mar 02 16:34:59 <live2>	*blood splatters everywhere over the IRC channel*
Mar 02 16:36:27 <OwlWizard>	jasassin, is it really a new browser or jsut yet another chromium fork?
Mar 02 16:37:08 <ayecee>	if it's written in common lisp, it's a safe bet that it's not a chromium fork
Mar 02 16:37:26 <jasassin>	a chromium for written in lisp?
Mar 02 16:37:28 *	jasassin ponders
Mar 02 16:37:31 <Khaytsus>	A browser written in lisp.  I hate this reality.
Mar 02 16:37:34 <Helenah>	web engines are soo complicated these days, you won't see any entirely new browsers pop up often.
Mar 02 16:38:04 <dostoyevsky2>	Helenah: Or someone is just gatekeeping the browsers
Mar 02 16:38:08 <ayecee>	well i mean if you want the new browser to be bug-for-bug compatible with the existing ones, yeah, that'll be a problem.
Mar 02 16:38:09 <rascul>	ladybird though
Mar 02 16:38:19 <jasassin>	you can program your own bookmark extensions in lisp!
Mar 02 16:38:24 <Khaytsus>	dostoyevsky2: Yeah, there's a shadow government making sure nobody makes new browsers.
Mar 02 16:38:27 <rascul>	https://ladybird.dev/
Mar 02 16:38:28 <derp_>	https://awesomekling.github.io/Ladybird-a-new-cross-platform-browser-project/
Mar 02 16:38:30 <Khaytsus>	So shadow you never hear the existed
Mar 02 16:38:34 <Helenah>	Also, I'd only really say something is a "chromium fork" if chromium was actually forked, if it's just the web engine that's used then it's not technically chromium.
Mar 02 16:38:53 <derp_>	rascul, haha
Mar 02 16:39:26 <AntonoiCarpio>	the current one that is gate keeping the browser engines wants to destroy 3rd party cookies so they can be the 3rd party cookies themselves
Mar 02 16:39:27 <Helenah>	qutebrowser for example has been described to me by the odd person as "Oh another chromium fork" but it's not nor does it feel like it, it just uses the same web engine.
Mar 02 16:39:36 <ayecee>	jasassin: for what it's worth, i've tried steam link on the chromecast. bit of latency there. fps games probably not going to be great, but works for casual games.
Mar 02 16:39:48 <dostoyevsky2>	Khaytsus: Well, people say there are no firefox distributions like for Linux because browsers are much more complicated... But I feel they just made the browsers that way, to make it hard... odd storage formats, lots of obfuscation
Mar 02 16:40:06 <Helenah>	Well technically the web developers are the ones gatekeeping.
Mar 02 16:40:06 <ayecee>	jasassin: the nvidia thingy does a better job of that, i hear.
Mar 02 16:40:11 <Khaytsus>	dostoyevsky2: You sure thinking was part of that?
Mar 02 16:40:24 <ayecee>	are we gatekeeping gatekeeping now
Mar 02 16:40:32 <derp_>	atleast we have firefox. The last bastion of truly open browsers
Mar 02 16:40:41 <AntonoiCarpio>	even with nvidia, i never got into the game streaming ordeal when it comes to specific genre of games like racing games
Mar 02 16:40:44 <dostoyevsky2>	Khaytsus: So what do you think about jsonlz4?
Mar 02 16:40:44 <Helenah>	I have custom parameters in qutebrowser to trick websites wrote by asshole developers.
Mar 02 16:41:05 <AntonoiCarpio>	games like BG3 is perfect though lol
Mar 02 16:41:09 <Helenah>	Else I risk getting "Incompatible browser" notices on certain websites that push major browsers onto me.
Mar 02 16:41:12 <AntonoiCarpio>	and somewhat platformers too but racing? nah
Mar 02 16:41:12 <ayecee>	neat that your browser can test for that.
Mar 02 16:41:46 <dostoyevsky2>	Khaytsus: Or indexedbs abuse of sqlite?
Mar 02 16:42:02 <Khaytsus>	dostoyevsky2: Are you just rambling at this point?
Mar 02 16:42:06 <pell_>	Helenah: People still code browser-specific sites? I'm having 90s flashbacks
Mar 02 16:42:18 <AntonoiCarpio>	I just use a firefox profile pretending to be Edge on specific sites lol
Mar 02 16:42:33 <Helenah>	Infact, thinking of it logically, it's huge companies like Amazon, etc whose websites do that sort of nonsense, the web developers are probably told to code things that push such notices onto you so that the company doesn't have to deal with your complaints.
Mar 02 16:42:46 <Helenah>	pell_: Yeah but for a different reason.
Mar 02 16:42:50 <ayecee>	pell_: more likely, people use toolkits that have browser-specific hooks.
Mar 02 16:43:03 <Helenah>	Not because there are adapted versions of HTML like in the old days.
Mar 02 16:43:08 <pell_>	I've seen sites that don't work on Firefox well
Mar 02 16:43:12 <Khaytsus>	I've seen some "enterprise" garbage that has browser requirements to use them.  Amazing how they cost $100/seat/mo but can't bother to make the page work in a few common browsers.
Mar 02 16:43:31 <dostoyevsky2>	Khaytsus: Nah, I've written my own tools for changing firefox configs and dumping the settings of extensions, but maybe if it's not shallow knowledge it's not your strongest point
Mar 02 16:43:31 <pell_>	But like ayecee said, that probably wasn't intentionally avoiding Firefox in those cases
Mar 02 16:43:35 <rascul>	costs too much to test for firefox so just call it chrome only
Mar 02 16:43:41 <AntonoiCarpio>	few? theres only chrome/chrome-based browsers and firefox lmao
Mar 02 16:43:42 <Khaytsus>	dostoyevsky2: So yes?  rambling?
Mar 02 16:44:07 <Helenah>	Well all sites seem to work on qutebrowser as long as the browser is kept up to date which it is, it's asshole developers who are told to do asshole things by companies who don't want to deal with complaints from users of minor browsers about genuine issues with their site.
Mar 02 16:44:11 <ayecee>	(i think he wants the answer "yes")
Mar 02 16:44:31 <rascul>	yes
Mar 02 16:44:32 <Khaytsus>	At least sites like caniuse has made web dev easier, or at least one would hope
Mar 02 16:44:42 <Khaytsus>	Assuming someone uses it I suppose
Mar 02 16:44:56 <ayecee>	first i've heard of it, but i guess i don't dev webs.
Mar 02 16:45:00 <AntonoiCarpio>	mfw site doesnt work properly when UA is default firefox but when it pretends to be Chrome or Edge, its all good 🥴
Mar 02 16:45:11 <pell_>	AntonoiCarpio: well, webkit
Mar 02 16:45:20 <rascul>	i don't care if site i make work in chrome because i don't use chrome and i'm my target audience
Mar 02 16:45:42 <Helenah>	qutebrowser uses the same engine as chromium but I've tricked websites into thinking it genuinely is Firefox instead of seeing it's actually qutebrowser.
Mar 02 16:45:45 <Khaytsus>	There's even a "caniuse" web analysis type tool, forget the name of it (Probably multiple ones) to catch html/css/js (or whatever else) code that's non-compliant or has restricted compliance.
Mar 02 16:46:00 <Khaytsus>	Helenah: I think we've all used useragent fakery ;)
Mar 02 16:46:11 <Helenah>	No, that doesn't work in the current day, Khaytsus
Mar 02 16:46:19 <Khaytsus>	Although useragent is actually not as easy to fake as it was, now it's not just headers :(
Mar 02 16:46:38 <Khaytsus>	Now you gotta fake the javascript engine info too
Mar 02 16:46:39 <Helenah>	It's one of the tricks I still use though.
Mar 02 16:46:40 <ayecee>	it still works. it doesn't always work.
Mar 02 16:46:43 <AntonoiCarpio>	theres also polyfil, which palemoon users (old firefox fork) use
Mar 02 16:46:44 <Helenah>	Khaytsus: Correct
Mar 02 16:46:52 <rascul>	it works if you work it
Mar 02 16:46:52 <Helenah>	And other things as well
Mar 02 16:47:37 <AntonoiCarpio>	Khaytsus: If they go soo far to do that, I'd say its message received that they dont want me
Mar 02 16:47:39 <Khaytsus>	I found a site once that if you set your browser language to say French but OS was English, the site would randomly have French in it.  Some things used browser language, some used whatever other calls they make to determine locale.  was pretty funny honestly.
Mar 02 16:47:44 <dostoyevsky2>	https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt <- is that the browser written in Lisp you were talking about?
Mar 02 16:47:56 <ayecee>	yes
Mar 02 16:48:14 <Khaytsus>	AntonoiCarpio: Useragent stuff?  Again my example earlier of enterprise garbageware that you may be forced to use at work or whatnot.
Mar 02 16:48:16 <ayecee>	the one jasassin mentioned off the top
Mar 02 16:48:16 <Helenah>	Seriously though, websites shouldn't check for web browser name, that's nonsense that doesn't achieve a legitimate aim, instead they should check for the versions of technologies the web browser uses and make judgement based on that. Two web browsers with the same technology versions would be just as compatible with websites.
Mar 02 16:48:27 <dostoyevsky2>	it would be cool if it were to use a libchromium or libfirefox internally
Mar 02 16:49:06 <ayecee>	Helenah: it was the most practical way to infer the versions of technologies the browser uses for a long time.
Mar 02 16:49:14 <ayecee>	still is, in many ways.
Mar 02 16:49:41 <dip_mondal>	i have JAVA_HOME variable inside /etc/environment file,
Mar 02 16:49:42 <dip_mondal>	How to add $JAVA_HOME/bin to the $PATH ?
Mar 02 16:49:42 <pell_>	I remember that Internet Explorer identified itself as Mozilla
Mar 02 16:49:42 <dip_mondal>	i did this,
Mar 02 16:49:43 <dip_mondal>	inside the /etc/profile file i added this line 👇
Mar 02 16:49:43 <dip_mondal>	PATH="$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin"
Mar 02 16:49:44 <dip_mondal>	    - and it's working but i have some questions 🙂
Mar 02 16:49:44 <dip_mondal>	1. is this way correct?
Mar 02 16:49:47 <ayecee>	but more importantly to infer the quirks in those implementations.
Mar 02 16:49:53 <ayecee>	oh he gone.
Mar 02 16:50:17 <_ReVoLt_>	hello any one know iptables for port forward on policy DROP in firewall?
Mar 02 16:50:34 <ayecee>	no, but i'll fake it if you hum a few bars
Mar 02 16:51:17 <ayecee>	_ReVoLt_: those all look like words but they don't make sense in the order they're in.
Mar 02 16:51:21 <Khaytsus>	dip_mondal: Use a pastebin
Mar 02 16:51:26 <ayecee>	Khaytsus: he gone
Mar 02 16:51:32 <Khaytsus>	>_>
Mar 02 16:51:33 <live2>	hebak
Mar 02 16:51:34 <ayecee>	oh he back
Mar 02 16:51:43 <Khaytsus>	Someone unkline'd him quickly, I was typing it
Mar 02 16:51:46 <_ReVoLt_>	ayecee:  ?
Mar 02 16:51:57 <ayecee>	_ReVoLt_: which part was not clear
Mar 02 16:52:05 <_ReVoLt_>	the whole  D
Mar 02 16:52:07 <_ReVoLt_>	xD
Mar 02 16:52:10 <ayecee>	read it again then
Mar 02 16:52:17 <OwlWizard>	just quick noob question. in a unix system is the c-standart library about the programming langugae?
Mar 02 16:52:25 <dostoyevsky2>	Does emacs have a web browser?  I guess it couldn't display images
Mar 02 16:52:29 <_ReVoLt_>	ayecee:  :^
Mar 02 16:52:35 <AntonoiCarpio>	emacs has a web browser
Mar 02 16:52:37 <AntonoiCarpio>	emacs has everything
Mar 02 16:52:38 <ayecee>	OwlWizard: how do you mean
Mar 02 16:52:40 <Khaytsus>	dostoyevsky2: Of course it does, its a full fledged OS afterall
Mar 02 16:52:46 <dostoyevsky2>	AntonoiCarpio: With images?
Mar 02 16:52:50 <pell_>	OwlWizard: It's the library programs compiled with C get their functionality from
Mar 02 16:52:58 <ayecee>	OwlWizard: programs written in languages other than C can use stdlib too.
Mar 02 16:53:19 <dip_mondal>	https://pastebin.com/8qiSRRL6
Mar 02 16:54:02 <pell_>	OwlWizard: like ayecee said, some other languages can link to it as well
Mar 02 16:54:05 <OwlWizard>	ayecee so its only called c-standart library because it it implemented in c? so i could implement one in rust(if i was smart enough) and it would still work?
Mar 02 16:54:12 <ayecee>	dip_mondal: use pastebin for pastes. it's not a replacement for describing the problem here.
Mar 02 16:54:26 <AntonoiCarpio>	dostoyevsky2: doesn't EWW already support that?
Mar 02 16:55:13 <ayecee>	dip_mondal: 1) it looks correct. 3) export makes the variable available to programs run by the shell 2) so you should probably export it
Mar 02 16:55:33 <ayecee>	OwlWizard: sure
Mar 02 16:55:40 <dostoyevsky2>	AntonoiCarpio: https://www.linuxlinks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screenshot-eww.jpg looks like it
Mar 02 16:56:10 <dostoyevsky2>	So we actually have two web browsers: Eww ind Emacs Lisp and Nyxt in Common Lisp
Mar 02 16:56:11 <pell_>	OwlWizard: That would not automatically work. But if programs used your library...then they would use your library
Mar 02 16:56:38 <OwlWizard>	ayecee, could you please tell me what exactly that standart library is used for
Mar 02 16:56:50 <ayecee>	OwlWizard: in a formal way? no.
Mar 02 16:56:52 <AntonoiCarpio>	go with EWW, cuz its eew
Mar 02 16:56:56 <AntonoiCarpio>	;) :D :P
Mar 02 16:57:20 <Khaytsus>	Do you close tabs with Meta-X Meta-C ?
Mar 02 16:57:26 <OwlWizard>	pell_, isnt there a drop in alternative to glibc out there alredy (i think its called lib musl)
Mar 02 16:57:35 <Khaytsus>	It's not drop-in
Mar 02 16:58:14 <ayecee>	programs must be compiled against it. but it provides much of the same functionality that glibc does.
Mar 02 16:58:25 <pell_>	OwlWizard: programs need to interact with the operating system in order to do what they do. If the OS uses the C standard library, then other programs use that library to interact with the OS. That's kind of a simple way of putting it.
Mar 02 16:58:32 <OwlWizard>	but one wouldnt need to change the code of the apps?
Mar 02 16:58:42 <ayecee>	mostly
Mar 02 16:58:53 <pell_>	OwlWizard: Yes. If the system is compiled against MUSL, then programs also compile against MUSL
Mar 02 16:58:58 <ayecee>	some things that work on glibc don't work on musl.
Mar 02 16:59:21 <ayecee>	or, work differently.
Mar 02 16:59:26 <rbox>	systemd needs to be patched to work on musl
Mar 02 16:59:32 <OwlWizard>	i aws just asking as iirc alpine uses musl
Mar 02 16:59:36 <OwlWizard>	or was it void
Mar 02 16:59:47 <ayecee>	alpine for sure
Mar 02 16:59:49 <pell_>	Void has a MUSL version
Mar 02 17:00:03 <pell_>	I have it installed on my laptop
Mar 02 17:00:17 <dostoyevsky2>	rbox: can't they just .. make musl more compatible with everything?
Mar 02 17:00:18 <Helenah>	"Delegating reverse DNS to your own nameservers", hmm.
Mar 02 17:00:27 <Helenah>	Not a bad idea...
Mar 02 17:00:45 <pell_>	You have to do some sandboxing tricks to get glibc programs working on a MUSL system, and vice versa
Mar 02 17:00:56 <ayecee>	dostoyevsky2: they could, at the expense of adding a bunch of stuff to musl, thus negating its competitive advandage.
Mar 02 17:01:01 <ayecee>	advantage too.
Mar 02 17:01:16 <OwlWizard>	what are musl's advantages?
Mar 02 17:01:25 <ayecee>	its relatively small size, mostly.
Mar 02 17:01:41 <pell_>	newer, more efficient
Mar 02 17:01:47 <ayecee>	no, not more efficient.
Mar 02 17:01:49 <ayecee>	just smaller.
Mar 02 17:02:44 <OwlWizard>	i think lib musl is also staticly linked (i heard this but dont know what it means in this context)
Mar 02 17:02:52 <ayecee>	that doesn't sound correct.
Mar 02 17:03:02 <rbox>	that doesnt make sense
Mar 02 17:03:03 <rbox>	lol
Mar 02 17:03:28 <dostoyevsky2>	https://github.com/ATiltedTree/systemd-musl/blob/main/0001-add-fallback-parse_printf_format-implementation.patch
Mar 02 17:03:39 <pell_>	well, efficiency is their stated goal. I haven't done any tests myself
Mar 02 17:03:39 <ayecee>	i guess it's difficult to static link glibc these days. maybe it's that musl _can_ be static linked.
Mar 02 17:03:50 <ayecee>	pell_: if it is, then it's space efficiency.
Mar 02 17:03:55 <dostoyevsky2>	So musl doesn't have all the printf formats... so the patch for systemd is to add those... I am not sure if musl is a good idea
Mar 02 17:04:01 <ayecee>	OwlWizard: not the normal way to use it though.
Mar 02 17:04:50 <OwlWizard>	ayecee, i dont know what static linking means in this context
Mar 02 17:05:14 <ayecee>	OwlWizard: it means the library becomes part of the executable, instead of a separate file that is loaded at runtime.
Mar 02 17:05:45 <ayecee>	the latter is dynamic linking, and is popular because several programs can use one copy of the library instead of each having their own.
Mar 02 17:06:05 <OwlWizard>	yea dynamic linking makes more sense for me then
Mar 02 17:06:20 <OwlWizard>	is static linking atleast faster?
Mar 02 17:06:46 <pell_>	static linking takes up a lot more space if everybody does it
Mar 02 17:06:56 <ayecee>	not significantly. its main use is when you want to distribute a binary without knowing which libc the target system uses
Mar 02 17:07:59 <ayecee>	or a recovery program that must be able to run when the system is in a state where dynamic libraries can't be loaded.
Mar 02 17:08:04 <dostoyevsky2>	ayecee: https://github.com/ATiltedTree/systemd-musl/blob/main/0009-do-not-use-glibc-specific-func.patch .. so musl strptime() doesn't support a loc parameter... But I guess that saves a lot...  but it could just choose to ignore the locale, and then the patch wouldn't be required
Mar 02 17:08:51 <rascul>	linus says shared libs aren't good   https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=whs8QZf3YnifdLv57+FhBi5_WeNTG1B-suOES=RcUSmQg@mail.gmail.com/
Mar 02 17:09:04 <ayecee>	*in certain contexts
Mar 02 17:09:15 <pnbeast>	I don't like to share, either, but my kindergarten teacher was adamant.
Mar 02 17:09:40 <pell_>	Adam Ant was your kindergarten teacher?
Mar 02 17:09:41 <lopid>	adam ant was your teacher‽
Mar 02 17:09:52 <rascul>	i share my things with myself
Mar 02 17:09:52 <pnbeast>	Wore the leather, had the guitar and everything.
Mar 02 17:10:22 <pell_>	lopid: great minds, and all that
Mar 02 17:10:31 <ayecee>	fools etc.
Mar 02 17:10:49 <lopid>	two in the bush, and so on
Mar 02 17:11:01 *	rascul cuts down the bush
Mar 02 17:11:23 <elektrinis>	I want to move my proxmox SSD to another system, intel -> AMD. Can I just move the disk and it will work, or should I reinstall?
Mar 02 17:11:33 <ayecee>	elektrinis: yes
Mar 02 17:11:35 <rbox>	elektrinis: well yo ucould try it...
Mar 02 17:11:49 <elektrinis>	yes works or yes reinstall
Mar 02 17:11:54 <ayecee>	yes to both
Mar 02 17:11:55 <rascul>	can both
Mar 02 17:12:01 <elektrinis>	mkay
Mar 02 17:12:21 <rascul>	move the disk and try it and you probably won't have to reinstall but if you do then reinstall
Mar 02 17:12:24 <elektrinis>	if reinstall, any way to backup the config?
Mar 02 17:12:29 <ayecee>	yes
Mar 02 17:13:06 <ayecee>	it'd be the kind of thing covered in the proxmox manual.
Mar 02 17:13:11 <dostoyevsky2>	elektrinis: Are you moving a vm inside proxmox or a SSD that has proxmox on it as its OS?
Mar 02 17:13:25 <elektrinis>	OS
Mar 02 17:14:21 <ayecee>	it'd be a good thing to incorporate into your backup strategy.
Mar 02 17:15:38 <ayecee>	neat, here it is. https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Backup_and_Restore
Mar 02 17:16:02 <ayecee>	oops, i think this is for backing up vms.
Mar 02 17:17:12 <jensen>	how's matrix for irc, signal, discord, and sms? anyone tried but preferred respective first-party client instead?
Mar 02 17:17:52 <ayecee>	i guess that's like most of what you'd want to back up, eh? then import them into the new proxmox server you set up.
Mar 02 17:21:00 <JakLareo>	jensen: not really a Linux question, but I tried Matrix and went back to using native clients for messaging. I found Matrix to be slow, but even more critically, unreliable. Messages would frequently not send, or not be received, or appear with the wrong metadata.
Mar 02 17:21:41 <Helenah>	OwlWizard: I think it was the Suckless Tools guys who were claiming that musl and uClib are statically linked but they seems to say some questionable stuff, I believe half the time they're strong to an ideology that they're blinded into seeing other ideologies as crap.
Mar 02 17:22:55 <OwlWizard>	Helenah, havent interacted much with suckless(the ideology nor people loving it) but from what little i know i kinda get them but not entirely
Mar 02 17:23:45 <ayecee>	reckon you kinda need to keep your eyes half-closed to maintain any consistent ideology.
Mar 02 17:24:32 <OwlWizard>	exceptions are kind of the norm
Mar 02 17:24:45 <ayecee>	otherwise the what-ifs spiral out of control and paralyze you.
Mar 02 17:25:42 <Helenah>	OwlWizard: I just don't like how they put things forward, it's in an obnoxious manner "Our way sucks less, those ways suck"
Mar 02 17:26:04 <Helenah>	Yet... it sucks if you use something like dwm and you have to re-compile each time you want to change its configuration.
Mar 02 17:26:05 <OwlWizard>	Helenah, yea certainly
Mar 02 17:26:47 <OwlWizard>	i find i weird how people often go "i dont get how people still use (insert thing they dont like) and not (thing they like)"
Mar 02 17:27:28 <OwlWizard>	its almost as though taste is an actually subjective thing rather than objective fact
Mar 02 17:28:50 <Helenah>	Personally, I believe their way would work brilliantly on embedded systems, but on everyones desktops/laptops? It would be tedious to the masses.
Mar 02 17:29:20 <OwlWizard>	i think ill need to look up suckless a bit more so i can effectively hold this conversation
Mar 02 17:29:28 <pell_>	Helenah: To be fair, I doubt the masses are their target userbase.
Mar 02 17:29:34 <Helenah>	"I need to configure my web browser so I'm gonna re-compile"
Mar 02 17:29:39 <buraq>	jasassin: here's the part of the gpl i can't figure out how red hat is skating around: "You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein."
Mar 02 17:30:07 <Helenah>	pell_: Yeah
Mar 02 17:31:14 <OwlWizard>	i just read the suckless manifest and i dont like the tone
Mar 02 17:31:32 <OwlWizard>	it seems like pure othering and honestly a bit arogant
Mar 02 17:32:22 <pell_>	When I tried dwm, recompiling after a config took a few seconds on my not awesome system. Granted I didn't have any patches, just some adjustments to config.h
Mar 02 17:35:15 <badsektor>	is there no way to tag the bootloader so it will drop you into a netinstall framework instead of booting into OS?
Mar 02 17:36:30 <ayecee>	there must be. i mean, the netinstall bootloader does it.
Mar 02 17:37:05 <pell_>	badsektor: grub can give you boot options. I don't know anything about netinstall
Mar 02 17:38:10 <badsektor>	you know there used to be a website www.goodbye-windows.com, it gave you a littl exe to install, and when you reboot, it starts downloading and installing linux
Mar 02 17:38:33 <badsektor>	i just wonder if there is something like that when you are already on linux
Mar 02 17:39:40 <ayecee>	there isn't a thing like that but it could be done in much the same way.
Mar 02 17:40:32 <OwlWizard>	but yea looking at suckless.org i dont really like it
Mar 02 17:40:38 <ayecee>	essentially by adding a new boot entry in the bootloader and defaulting to it.
Mar 02 17:41:03 <pell_>	yeah, I'm not sure how that's better than what already exists
Mar 02 17:41:20 <badsektor>	ayecee, i am sure there is already a how-to on the web somewhere, what to search for it?
Mar 02 17:41:30 <ayecee>	badsektor: i'm fairly sure there isn't
Mar 02 17:41:57 <ayecee>	it's easier to find howtos for things people do than for things they don't do
Mar 02 17:42:03 <badsektor>	just dont have a usb stick handy, so i thought maybe a way to reinstall linux without any media
Mar 02 17:42:51 <buraq>	ayecee: why did you msg me?
Mar 02 17:42:59 <pell_>	I suppose you could put the install disk into a partition and then boot into that
Mar 02 17:43:05 <monr0e>	Does this look abotu right for a xorg.conf? http://paste.debian.net/1309244/
Mar 02 17:43:08 <pell_>	that's probably basically what that exe did
Mar 02 17:43:14 <ayecee>	buraq: i don't want to play this game.
Mar 02 17:43:24 <buraq>	ayecee: what game?
Mar 02 17:44:56 <pell_>	you may not even need the partition, maybe just a link to the iso
Mar 02 17:45:29 <ayecee>	pell_: it'd have to be a partition that wouldn't be modified by the install, i guess
Mar 02 17:45:55 <buraq>	ayecee: please answer to me what you mean
Mar 02 17:46:47 <pell_>	if the install is a net install, it may not need the iso after loading into memory
Mar 02 17:47:02 <pell_>	but I'm not sure about that
Mar 02 17:47:13 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 02 17:47:14 *	litharge sets ban on $a:buraq
Mar 02 17:47:14 *	litharge has kicked buraq from #linux (Discuss your ban in #linux-ops. (by ayecee))
Mar 02 17:47:25 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 02 17:47:32 <ayecee>	that's enough akik sockpuppeting.
Mar 02 17:47:41 <BlueSky>	Is system-monitor in eclipse IDE still supported?
Mar 02 17:56:11 <OwlWizard>	i dont know why but i kinda love the idea of consumer multi cpu system's
Mar 02 17:56:31 <wantyapps>	OwlWizard: Me too! It just seems neat
Mar 02 17:57:03 <ayecee>	we kinda have that now, just that the cpus are in one package.
Mar 02 17:57:07 <OwlWizard>	wantyapps, like yes i know that i have enough cpu cores but still the idea of having like two risc-v cpu's is cool
Mar 02 17:57:24 <wantyapps>	OwlWizard: Absolutely.
Mar 02 17:57:34 <wantyapps>	Were you the guy that was "kinda new" to IRC yesterday?
Mar 02 17:57:40 <wantyapps>	You seemed to get the hang of it!
Mar 02 17:57:54 <OwlWizard>	ayecee, i know and that is why i dont know why i like the idea of having multiple socketed cpu's
Mar 02 17:58:09 <OwlWizard>	wantyapps, yes im that guy from yesterday
Mar 02 17:58:25 <ayecee>	me too. multi-processor SMP setups were instant leet points back in the day.
Mar 02 17:58:28 <OwlWizard>	some things are still weird but ill get it someday
Mar 02 17:58:35 <wantyapps>	So... That new guy from yesterday really seemed to get the hang of IRC.
Mar 02 17:58:39 <preach>	multi socket is the only true way to have two tasks running at exactly the same time
Mar 02 17:59:07 <OwlWizard>	im thinking about trying to get an old dual pentium 3 system
Mar 02 17:59:15 <ayecee>	maybe not the only true way, but definitely the only cool way.
Mar 02 17:59:16 <wantyapps>	why tho :)
Mar 02 17:59:18 <preach>	get the celery
Mar 02 17:59:29 <preach>	overclock the 330A's to 550
Mar 02 17:59:49 <Codebecile>	I feel bad for the guy whose username is get
Mar 02 17:59:55 <wantyapps>	Me too.
Mar 02 17:59:59 <wantyapps>	I think it was intentional
Mar 02 18:00:26 <Codebecile>	It's pretty likely, wantyapps
Mar 02 18:00:29 <ayecee>	hopefully they've set up their highlighting so it doesn't respond to the bare word.
Mar 02 18:00:37 <OwlWizard>	preach, arent those celeron's weak in comparison?
Mar 02 18:00:45 <Codebecile>	Maybe they like it like that, ayecee
Mar 02 18:00:57 <ayecee>	maybe!
Mar 02 18:01:04 <Codebecile>	I dunno. There's some weird people out there.
Mar 02 18:01:28 <ayecee>	there's more normal people than weird people though.
Mar 02 18:01:39 <OwlWizard>	i mean define weird
Mar 02 18:01:50 <OwlWizard>	most people dont use irc
Mar 02 18:01:54 <ayecee>	two standard deviations off the norm
Mar 02 18:01:55 <Codebecile>	I mean, define weird, yeah.
Mar 02 18:02:16 <Codebecile>	Most people don't use linux or affiliate themselves with it. Let alone join an entire IRC group to talk about it.
Mar 02 18:02:18 <nullvalue>	two notches above or below the norm!!!
Mar 02 18:02:33 <Codebecile>	We are in a point of a percent of the general population.
Mar 02 18:02:42 <ayecee>	really in any direction from the norm. it's multidimensional.
Mar 02 18:03:23 <preach>	most irc users live in a different world
Mar 02 18:03:24 <Codebecile>	I'd say we're all p weird
Mar 02 18:03:25 <nullvalue>	ah, i was hoping you would say in a quantum realm.....
Mar 02 18:03:28 *	ayecee starts calculating weirdness vectors
Mar 02 18:04:03 <OwlWizard>	nullvalue, wouldnt that imply us being in a quantum superposition?
Mar 02 18:04:17 <ayecee>	Codebecile: sure but that's one dimension of weird. you're talking about a different direction of weird from that reference, even.
Mar 02 18:04:25 <OwlWizard>	btw how do you do these chat statements like ayecee did?
Mar 02 18:04:31 <nullvalue>	nah you might just be figments of my imagination....
Mar 02 18:04:36 <peac>	you people superpose with whomever you want but please let me out of it
Mar 02 18:04:38 <ayecee>	OwlWizard: /me blows a raspberry
Mar 02 18:04:39 <Codebecile>	There's crackheaded weird and then there's non-average weird
Mar 02 18:04:53 <ayecee>	Codebecile: sure, many dimensions of weird.
Mar 02 18:05:00 *	OwlWizard tries to use the chat function
Mar 02 18:05:08 <ayecee>	nice
Mar 02 18:05:27 *	nullvalue slithers away
Mar 02 18:05:30 *	Codebecile waves hi to test if possible
Mar 02 18:06:17 <OwlWizard>	i mean im autistic nerd weird
Mar 02 18:06:29 <OwlWizard>	wich i still think is better than incel weird
Mar 02 18:06:59 <ayecee>	i think the uses-irc weird vector does not correlate with the likes-superfluous-notifications vector
Mar 02 18:07:31 <OwlWizard>	ayecee, define superflues
Mar 02 18:07:37 <OwlWizard>	i like some notifications
Mar 02 18:07:37 <peac>	get is just an attention wh*re
Mar 02 18:07:54 <ayecee>	OwlWizard: no.
Mar 02 18:08:09 <OwlWizard>	ok
Mar 02 18:09:48 <OwlWizard>	does wierdness have a sort of direction to it? like there are multiple kinds of weird with different kinds of suverity
Mar 02 18:10:29 <ayecee>	multiple kinds of weird, yes, and different severities within those kinds, yes
Mar 02 18:10:29 <peac>	i would say weirdness is just a statistical tool, it applies differently to every norm you study
Mar 02 18:11:05 <OwlWizard>	weirdness seems rather relative to me
Mar 02 18:11:24 <ayecee>	well yeah. by definition.
Mar 02 18:11:34 <ayecee>	it's relative to the norm.
Mar 02 18:11:43 <peac>	i think we could argue it's absolute given a strict set of characteristics and a clearly defined sample
Mar 02 18:11:56 <OwlWizard>	are we stretching this joke to far?
Mar 02 18:12:06 <peac>	i'm not joking
Mar 02 18:12:08 <ayecee>	i didn't know we were joking
Mar 02 18:12:18 <peac>	it's a subject i'm often thinking about
Mar 02 18:13:30 <OwlWizard>	oh i thought it aws
Mar 02 18:13:34 <OwlWizard>	was
Mar 02 18:13:52 <ayecee>	okay, the two standard deviation thing was a joke.
Mar 02 18:14:05 <ayecee>	we don't even know if it follows a normal distribution.
Mar 02 18:14:08 <peac>	OwlWizard: you can use a sed regex to correct your messages, some irc clients will apply it
Mar 02 18:14:30 <ayecee>	speaking of jokes, eh
Mar 02 18:14:32 <peac>	ayecee: i did like that joke and think it's an intersting point
Mar 02 18:15:15 <OwlWizard>	peac, i honestly dont know how to use regex yet
Mar 02 18:15:25 <peac>	like tihs
Mar 02 18:15:30 <ayecee>	no problem. just fake it like everyone else!
Mar 02 18:15:41 <peac>	s/tihs/tis
Mar 02 18:15:48 <peac>	s/tis/this
Mar 02 18:15:52 <peac>	damn
Mar 02 18:16:00 <ayecee>	not really a regex but a sed command
Mar 02 18:16:05 <ayecee>	or ed
Mar 02 18:16:08 <peac>	yes right
Mar 02 18:16:24 <luna_>	https://i.imgur.com/B3M4d1h.png
Mar 02 18:19:47 <peac>	OwlWizard: https://regexr.com/ is a good tool to learn it when you're done with rust and git, and after reading the regex manual if that's even a thing
Mar 02 18:20:08 <ayecee>	"man 7 regex"
Mar 02 18:20:12 <OwlWizard>	peac,thanks
Mar 02 18:20:40 <ayecee>	mind you, that's posix regex. perl compatible regexes seem to be the hot thing right now.
Mar 02 18:21:00 <OwlWizard>	im not using perl though
Mar 02 18:21:10 <peac>	i hate the many standards of standard stuff
Mar 02 18:21:14 <ayecee>	neither are most people using regexes
Mar 02 18:21:18 <peac>	perl is everywhere
Mar 02 18:21:33 <ayecee>	that's why they call it perl compatible regex and not perl regex
Mar 02 18:21:54 <Artfaith>	Perl is ineffably magnificent for any complex Regex or anywhere Bash can on do what must be done in shell...
Mar 02 18:22:02 <Artfaith>	cannot do*
Mar 02 18:23:04 <OwlWizard>	peac, you mean like usb is supposed to be a standart but is rather just a collection of subsets of the main standart?
Mar 02 18:23:08 <ayecee>	such hagiographic praise needs illustrated letters.
Mar 02 18:23:45 <peac>	OwlWizard: i'm not getting any hair-pulling issues with usb though
Mar 02 18:24:14 <peac>	with regex standards, i do
Mar 02 18:25:24 <ayecee>	i am
Mar 02 18:25:30 <OwlWizard>	peac, ok valid
Mar 02 18:26:02 <peac>	ayecee right, i was thinking i do pull my hair which is the next level
Mar 02 18:26:03 <OwlWizard>	i am just annoyed that usb 4 isnt just you know usb 4 but rather what feels like 50 different substandarts with bad names
Mar 02 18:26:07 <ayecee>	especially regarding the competing fast charging/power delivery standards and compatible cables.
Mar 02 18:26:35 <peac>	the names are bad indeed
Mar 02 18:30:45 <jasassin>	USB 4.324c+
Mar 02 18:31:44 <OwlWizard>	usb 6.89+i67 X
Mar 02 18:32:06 <peac>	when your phone has 95% battery, you unplug it and you realize it actually has 5% battery because the charger was PERL instead of POSIX
Mar 02 18:32:34 <peac>	and the cable was utf8 instead of ascii
Mar 02 18:32:44 <wantyapps>	peac: Chuckled and my brother looked at me suspiciously
Mar 02 18:32:54 <vycka>	USB pi
Mar 02 18:33:36 <mutante>	have you seen a script/tool/browser extension or something to download ALL photos from an icloud.com account to your Linux desktop? regardless of browser I can't just select all items at once.. max 1000 at a time and it's super annoying.. I want to automate it to really just get all for me in the background
Mar 02 18:35:01 <mutante>	other solution are all some 3rd party Windows apps
Mar 02 18:35:32 <OwlWizard>	thats kinda the thing i like about thunderbolt. btw what was the reason again as to why thunderbolt was intel and apple exclusive for so long?
Mar 02 18:36:09 <peac>	because they created and licenced it
Mar 02 18:36:19 <peac>	s/licenced/licensed
Mar 02 18:36:52 <peac>	apple has a track record of creating standards and keeping it for themselves as a vendor lock in
Mar 02 18:37:23 <peac>	.... like with icloud for instance
Mar 02 18:37:57 <mutante>	it would be just fine if only I could do "Ctrl + A" to select all and get one giant .zip file.. kind of like when you export data from Google takeout
Mar 02 18:38:08 <rbox>	peac: doesnt' sound like a standard then...
Mar 02 18:38:23 <OwlWizard>	didnt intel release thunderbolt 4 wich got implemented somewhat into the usb 4 standart?
Mar 02 18:38:36 <vycka>	i think its optional?
Mar 02 18:38:38 <peac>	mutante: i did not do extensive research but that sounds like you're going to need a macos instance
Mar 02 18:39:01 <peac>	rbox: it's a standard if it allows something to work with many brands of something else
Mar 02 18:39:02 <mutante>	peac: I dont have one... Debian laptop and iPhone .. hmmm
Mar 02 18:39:21 <peac>	mutante: this is not legal advice but macos technically runs in vms
Mar 02 18:39:29 <rbox>	peac: if they're "keeping it to themselves"...
Mar 02 18:39:43 <peac>	that's what we call a proprietary standard
Mar 02 18:39:46 <mutante>	peac: hmm. interesting idea. maybe I should first try one of the Windows apps for this and try it in wine?
Mar 02 18:39:58 <peac>	that could work
Mar 02 18:41:50 <mutante>	hmm.. python3-pyicloud - wrapper to access iPhone and Calendar data in the iCloud
Mar 02 18:42:01 <peac>	looks like a lead
Mar 02 18:42:23 <peac>	can't your iphone download the batch ?
Mar 02 18:42:26 <mutante>	didnt' expect "apt cache icloud" to actually return something :)
Mar 02 18:42:38 <mutante>	apt-cache search I mean
Mar 02 18:42:47 <peac>	you can use apt search nowadays
Mar 02 18:43:34 <mutante>	peac: I need to back everything up before the iphone is replaced with new hardware..repair
Mar 02 18:43:58 <mutante>	peac: thanks for the tips
Mar 02 18:58:26 <jim>	apt search put search terms here
Mar 02 18:58:50 <susi>	apt search foo
Mar 02 18:59:01 <jim>	yeah

Mar 02 19:02:34 <mutante>	peac: I found a solution without mac or windows:)  https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader  works and currently downloading
Mar 02 19:03:49 <peac>	nice python script
Mar 02 19:04:30 <mutante>	it's using pyicloud but I didn't have to write code myself
Mar 02 19:19:38 <OwlWizard>	thing is id like to get an usb 4 add-in card but i dont really have a use for usb4. also the only add in card i have found is from asus and the needed connector isnt compatible with asrock mainboards
Mar 02 19:20:34 <peac>	why do you want an usb4 card if you don't need one ?
Mar 02 19:23:27 <peac>	i mean i sometimes buy things i don't need, no judgement here
Mar 02 19:23:30 <OwlWizard>	i would like to know myself
Mar 02 19:24:31 <peac>	are there things you would need that you could buy instead ?
Mar 02 19:24:32 <joo>	you could buy it just in case you might get the need in the future
Mar 02 19:24:52 <peac>	then you also need a storage for maybe-needed things
Mar 02 19:24:58 <peac>	i have a huge one
Mar 02 19:25:17 <mutante>	buying early is usually wasting money though when in electronics
Mar 02 19:25:33 <OwlWizard>	i mean i also dont need a sun ultra sparc station yet i want one
Mar 02 19:26:31 <peac>	and there's things i really think i need but clearly can't buy, like a lumatone
Mar 02 19:26:42 <pell_>	I learned Unix (-like) on a Sun Sparc. It wasn't mine, though.
Mar 02 19:27:00 <cappy>	OwlWizard: you mean the old "pizza box"?
Mar 02 19:27:05 <peac>	OwlWizard: maybe you can borrow a usb4 card, see how it feels
Mar 02 19:27:12 <joo>	i dont need a petabyte moosefs cluster at all
Mar 02 19:27:14 <pell_>	In fact, that was the first time I ever IRC'd now that I think about it.
Mar 02 19:27:58 <OwlWizard>	cappy, well the 64 bit version of that but yes
Mar 02 19:28:10 <mutante>	wouldn't you also need a device that uses it?
Mar 02 19:28:19 <joo>	looks like an amazing card, i wonder if i can pit it into my laptop
Mar 02 19:28:37 <cappy>	OwlWizard: Didn't think they were still around; been years since I've touched that.
Mar 02 19:29:02 <OwlWizard>	cappy, they arent being made anymore but yea they still exist
Mar 02 19:30:38 <pell_>	I was once tempted to buy an old SGI Octane workstation on eBay a few years ago, because I remembered how unattainable something like that used to be
Mar 02 19:31:52 <OwlWizard>	im just weirdly interested in old unix on risc workstations

Mar 03 10:47:03 <itt788>	is there anyone who knows about the `-full` command line option in magick
Mar 03 10:47:04 <itt788>	?
Mar 03 10:47:20 <itt788>	sorry, `-fuzz`
Mar 03 10:48:37 <lobster>	Hi am I in yet. Just tried Pidgin ... unsuccessfully [oops]
Mar 03 10:49:15 <lobster>	Success ... so much for pidgin!
Mar 03 10:49:21 <mlu>	lobster: lol
Mar 03 10:49:29 <mlu>	lobster: it's not a good IRC client, but it's great for IM
Mar 03 10:50:01 <lobster>	Greeting fellow penguins. Long time Puppy Linux user here ..
Mar 03 10:50:51 <mlu>	woof woof *penguin sounds*
Mar 03 10:51:11 <lobster>	thanks mlu, Long time since I been on IRC. I am trying to use social media
Mar 03 10:51:39 <lobster>	ah ha you speak Puppy leet mlu, I invented much of it ...
Mar 03 10:51:55 <pell_>	itt788: what is magick?
Mar 03 10:52:08 <VanUnamed>	burn the social media
Mar 03 10:52:20 <itt788>	pell_: ImageMagick
Mar 03 10:52:39 <lobster>	I retired from Puppy about 2 years after Barry Kauler
Mar 03 10:52:41 <itt788>	the command name the most used is magick
Mar 03 10:53:02 <mlu>	huh, I use 'convert' :P
Mar 03 10:53:04 <pell_>	ok. I remember convert
Mar 03 10:53:22 <mlu>	I've used blur, but I've never used fuzz
Mar 03 10:53:54 <lobster>	sadly my fam insist on using whatsapp [lobster puking]
Mar 03 10:54:19 <pell_>	I've been meaning to install it again, so here goes. I'm curious.
Mar 03 10:54:43 <mlu>	it is a useful tool
Mar 03 10:55:04 <lobster>	At the moment I am using Manjaro ... too stupid to use Arch. Manjaro has/is still a job and a half
Mar 03 10:55:51 <luna_>	lobster: not that hard to use and install arch with archinstall
Mar 03 10:56:20 <lobster>	thanks luna but I am a GUI type of Puppy
Mar 03 10:57:23 <lobster>	I only use command line as a last resort (resorts are for holidays anyways) ;-)
Mar 03 10:57:28 <pell_>	It's the magick command now. convert symlinks to magick, at least here on Void
Mar 03 10:58:33 <pell_>	-fuzz <distance> treats colors within <distance> as equal for whatever operation you're doing, according to "man magick"
Mar 03 10:58:42 <lobster>	I am so happy to have IRC working again. I could do a penguin waddle ... :)
Mar 03 10:59:13 <lobster>	 It has been years
Mar 03 10:59:14 <luna_>	well more to set up manually the Manjaro but Arch Wiki for the help and tbh i rather use EndeavourOS, ArkaneLinux and Crystal Linux and not something thats 3 weeks away from what main Arch is, if i want to use something Arch based
Mar 03 10:59:37 <luna_>	seems a bit stupid to me to be based on a rolling distro and stray 3-6 weeks of that base distro
Mar 03 10:59:45 <luna_>	away*
Mar 03 11:00:30 <pell_>	I'm taking that to mean if you're doing a blur or something, the distinction between colors within the pixel distance you specify will not be taken into account
Mar 03 11:00:32 <n4dir>	real man use the new version even a day before it is released.
Mar 03 11:00:58 <lobster>	Well I am setting up a server ... and am ending up sing the command line [boo hiss]
Mar 03 11:01:14 <lobster>	sorru "using"
Mar 03 11:01:20 <luna_>	n4dir: so that only counts for men?
Mar 03 11:01:29 <lobster>	sorry no spell checker
Mar 03 11:02:47 <lobster>	no it only counts for desperate, autistic and hard knots, nuts and unreal men [only joshing]
Mar 03 11:03:35 <lobster>	LOL - yes testing beta is fine but but I am on long term rolling release
Mar 03 11:04:42 <lobster>	You men, boys and deary weirdies are fun ...
Mar 03 11:05:15 <lobster>	beardy [olde keyboard]
Mar 03 11:05:19 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 03 11:05:19 *	litharge removes ban on $a:Nigalicious
Mar 03 11:05:19 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 03 11:06:13 <lobster>	if setting up a server quick and easy on Arch wot would you use?
Mar 03 11:06:23 <pell_>	itt788: did that help?
Mar 03 11:07:11 <luna_>	lobster: Arch with the archinstall Server profile
Mar 03 11:07:34 <luna_>	thats exactly how this computer that runs irssi is setup
Mar 03 11:07:49 <luna_>	and the linux-lts kernel
Mar 03 11:08:37 <lobster>	ah OK that sounds good. I am using Caddy (well trying to) gonna start with that
Mar 03 11:09:19 <lobster>	Have a friend who was gonna use Arch ... ended up using Ubuntu ...
Mar 03 11:10:08 <lobster>	all interesting luna. I am jst getting up to speed
Mar 03 11:11:16 <lobster>	What do penguins drink these days. Is water safe?
Mar 03 11:13:04 <lobster>	time for me to go. Thanks everyone ... check out Mastodon. Be kind to admins, elders and ... well everyone ...
Mar 03 11:13:19 <whiskey76>	o/
Mar 03 11:13:27 <lobster>	Lobster over and out
Mar 03 11:15:06 <lopid>	are there any devices that you can plug a usb, video, network etc cable into and it'll tell you its specs? like what spec an hdmi cable is for example?
Mar 03 11:16:03 <lopid>	i think i saw something like it for usb or something on that china amazon site
Mar 03 11:34:43 <demon__>	hello, i run something in screen but i cant seem to scroll up, it's very small buffer or something
Mar 03 11:35:28 <demon__>	how do i fix that?
Mar 03 11:36:46 <lopid>	ctrl-a, esc, then up, k, ctrl-u, or ctrl-b
Mar 03 11:41:08 <demon__>	thanks this work but i still feel the backlog is small but ya that scrolls up
Mar 03 11:42:03 <lopid>	you can alter the scrollback value
Mar 03 11:42:16 <lopid>	or set defscrollback in .screenrc for future
Mar 03 11:44:47 <suid_dumpable>	demon__: do you really use the scrollback of screen? ctrl-a esc -- then cursor up / page up
Mar 03 11:45:17 <lopid>	…
Mar 03 11:45:36 <demon__>	suid_dumpable, i do yes and ya that works
Mar 03 11:46:28 <demon__>	lopid, where is .screenrc file at? i don't find it in home directory
Mar 03 11:46:42 <lopid>	create ~/.screenrc
Mar 03 11:47:13 <lopid>	put "defscrollback 2000" in it, for example
Mar 03 11:47:52 <demon__>	thank you
Mar 03 11:52:44 <demon__>	what is the default scrollback for a screen btw?
Mar 03 11:54:05 <lopid>	100
Mar 03 11:54:15 <lopid>	it's in the man page
Mar 03 11:55:34 <demon__>	oh that's why it's too small
Mar 03 11:55:42 <demon__>	thanks, will check man page
Mar 03 11:58:59 <lobster>	... and I am back on a different system running Manjaro and Hexchat
Mar 03 12:00:10 <lobster>	Should I persevere with pidgin? I wanted to run Matrix ... Which is taking me a while to get my claws around
Mar 03 12:02:32 <gog>	pidgin isn't a very good irc client
Mar 03 12:02:44 <gog>	idk about matrix
Mar 03 12:03:16 <lobster>	yes you are right it is useless and frustrating with IRC
Mar 03 12:03:54 <gog>	stick with hexchat for irc
Mar 03 12:04:04 <lobster>	matrix is I think used by gamers. I was using it to get info on mastodon ...
Mar 03 12:04:17 <lobster>	good advice gog
Mar 03 12:05:48 <jadeia>	Bit of an open ended question, but... I'm a few months into Linux and now using Fedora. I've used the desktop environment for pretty much everything so far but really want to become comfortable with and learn more console commands. Whats the best place to start?
Mar 03 12:06:42 <gog>	reach for the console for file management first
Mar 03 12:06:44 <pell_>	jadeia: do your system updates from the command line. then install software there
Mar 03 12:06:48 <gog>	also taht
Mar 03 12:07:08 <gog>	i almost never use a GUI file manager
Mar 03 12:07:08 <lobster>	fedoras website and info there is qood, they also provide tutorials ...
Mar 03 12:07:54 <pell_>	there's a very good free book called "t
Mar 03 12:08:01 <pell_>	"The Linux Command Line"
Mar 03 12:08:08 <jadeia>	I do the updates from console already - I'll check out the Fedora tutorials thanks. Using terminal for file management would be a good skill to pickup
Mar 03 12:08:27 <jadeia>	I'll check out that book thanks
Mar 03 12:08:28 <lobster>	I use nothing but GUI ... unless absolutely neccessary
Mar 03 12:09:14 <lobster>	book sounds good pell_
Mar 03 12:09:51 <pell_>	GUI things can change from one environment to another, but the command line is usually pretty consistent across the board
Mar 03 12:09:53 <jadeia>	Found the pdf for the book - thank you thats perfect
Mar 03 12:10:01 <gog>	using a console text editor is a good skill too
Mar 03 12:10:15 <lobster>	Hooray another satisfied penguin!
Mar 03 12:10:29 <gog>	i won't evangelize a particular family of editors
Mar 03 12:10:56 <jadeia>	Its funny because I started with console as a kid in the 90s at school. Then Windows came out and I got lazy :)
Mar 03 12:11:21 <jadeia>	Linux feels like Im home again.
Mar 03 12:11:30 <pell_>	yeah, our first computers were text only
Mar 03 12:11:50 <pell_>	mostly text-only
Mar 03 12:11:50 <lobster>	I have just moved to leafpad ... just text. Command line editors so many ...
Mar 03 12:12:03 <gog>	i'm a neovim user
Mar 03 12:12:15 <lobster>	cool gog
Mar 03 12:12:23 <gog>	i've been using vim-type editors for so long my muscle memory is pretty hard to break
Mar 03 12:12:34 <lobster>	understood
Mar 03 12:13:12 <lobster>	I barely remember my text based computers ...
Mar 03 12:13:19 <gog>	ope we're going out for breakfast
Mar 03 12:13:21 <gog>	byeee
Mar 03 12:13:33 <lobster>	byee enjoy
Mar 03 12:14:32 <pell_>	cassette tapes for storage
Mar 03 12:14:37 <lobster>	I am interested in discusing Linux over CB radio in UK... but enough to do for now
Mar 03 12:15:29 <lobster>	cassette tapes, bet you don't remember 8"discs? Me neither ...
Mar 03 12:15:32 <pell_>	lobster: are there enough people in CB range who use both Linux and CB?
Mar 03 12:15:46 <aquanox>	test
Mar 03 12:16:44 <lobster>	Well I don't know bu there is a sstem known as, gosh forgot name but it can network your CB to carry much further
Mar 03 12:17:18 <pell_>	here in the US, ham radio has systems like that
Mar 03 12:18:11 <lobster>	yes as far as I know UK usage is unliscenced, so it is an intriguing comms posibility
Mar 03 12:18:13 <pell_>	CB range is restricted
Mar 03 12:18:30 <pell_>	here CB is unlicensed but restricted in range
Mar 03 12:18:54 <lobster>	got it. Just begun my investigating ...
Mar 03 12:19:03 <pell_>	I know people have always violated the range, but don't get caught
Mar 03 12:19:30 <multi8>	skip on 27.555 :-)
Mar 03 12:19:31 <lobster>	I have not been to caught/court for years
Mar 03 12:19:32 <pell_>	here, I mean
Mar 03 12:20:02 <lobster>	Yes I think you have SWAT enforcement a little overkill ...
Mar 03 12:20:37 <lobster>	So back to Linux ...
Mar 03 12:20:52 <jadeia>	@pell that book "The Linux Command Line" by William Shotts is absolutely perfect - exactly what I was looking for. Lucky I asked the question when you saw it. Thank you good sir!
Mar 03 12:21:06 <jadeia>	@pell_
Mar 03 12:21:10 <lobster>	Been trying out caddy as a file serving start (works from command line)
Mar 03 12:21:14 <pell_>	jadeia: my pleasure
Mar 03 12:21:20 <pell_>	without the @
Mar 03 12:21:54 <lobster>	good news jadeie
Mar 03 12:24:37 <pell_>	jadeia: some distro specific things may be out of date, but general linux info is great
Mar 03 12:24:51 <lobster>	I think I may find some IRC tutoring
Mar 03 12:25:37 <lobster>	gonna start with Nickname Registration
Mar 03 12:26:57 <pell_>	lobster: did you look at the kibera site?

Mar 03 12:27:28 <dmr104>	hello. I have a dhcp router which handles the dns and acts as a gateway.  this is a dedicated box provider by the broadband provider.  I wish to set up a linux samba fileserver behind this to be accessible from outside the router.  What technologies should i be using?  Do I need to set up a dynamic dns client from my linux fileserver?
Mar 03 12:27:50 <lobster>	yep looking at it now
Mar 03 12:28:24 <lopid>	if you want it to be known by a consistent fqdn
Mar 03 12:28:24 <pell_>	lobster: https://libera.chat/guides/faq#why-are-people-trying-to-log-in-as-me
Mar 03 12:28:51 <pell_>	woops wrong link
Mar 03 12:28:58 <lobster>	no need for a name really - I am just used to lobster
Mar 03 12:29:12 <lobster>	thanks lopid
Mar 03 12:30:01 <dmr104>	lopid: yes, i want it to be known by a fqdn.  Is there a package on debian which will do this for me?
Mar 03 12:30:09 <pell_>	https://libera.chat/guides/registration
Mar 03 12:30:16 <lobster>	OK Pell I am on the right page now
Mar 03 12:30:36 <pell_>	you want to register so your nick is reserved for you
Mar 03 12:30:37 <lopid>	i don't know. search for dyndns
Mar 03 12:31:00 <lobster>	yep that is the page I am on :-)
Mar 03 12:31:50 <lobster>	yep might as well do it pell_
Mar 03 12:32:18 <lobster>	let me see how I get on
Mar 03 12:32:47 <pell_>	then you can cloak your host so your IP isn't displayed every time you join and part
Mar 03 12:36:18 <cructacean>	cool
Mar 03 12:38:25 <cructacean>	Yeh baby ... lobster is now registered as cructacean!
Mar 03 12:39:54 <cructacean>	thanks to NickServ and all those here lurkers, Fedorians etc
Mar 03 12:42:39 <louipc>	congrats
Mar 03 12:42:58 <pell_>	was lobster unavailable?
Mar 03 12:44:17 <cructacean>	yep it was pell
Mar 03 12:45:04 <cructacean>	wonder if that worked
Mar 03 12:45:28 <cructacean>	no  ... there is an alias command but forgot it
Mar 03 12:45:36 <cructacean>	ah well ..
Mar 03 12:47:50 <cructacean>	just installed a samba server on Manjaro BUT not quite working ... might have to play with it
Mar 03 12:48:35 <cructacean>	written in C and python ... so cool and open source
Mar 03 12:50:29 <cructacean>	time for my din dins soon ... wonder if I might try pickled penguin ... mmm .. probably not PC (politically correct = woke)
Mar 03 12:51:49 <cructacean>	thanks everyone for putting up with my gibbering ... I'll be back!!

Mar 03 13:24:34 <Helenah>	What the heck do I do with 18.45 quintillion IPv6 addresses?
Mar 03 13:25:05 <Helenah>	My ISP gave those to me.
Mar 03 13:25:38 <MrKnox>	lol
Mar 03 13:25:59 <pell_>	Mistake? Or do they not think they'll need then anytime soon?
Mar 03 13:26:24 <pell_>	I hear IPs were pretty liberally given out in the early days of the Internet
Mar 03 13:26:25 <xx>	Helenah: you become an ISP yourself
Mar 03 13:26:54 <Helenah>	pell_: Not a mistake, it's part of my package.
Mar 03 13:27:18 <pell_>	can I have some?
Mar 03 13:27:20 <sheep>	Most ISPs issue a /64 prefix for ipv6
Mar 03 13:27:36 <Helenah>	Ah right, interesting.
Mar 03 13:27:55 <MrKnox>	ipv6 charity
Mar 03 13:28:20 <Helenah>	sheep: Do most ISPs have them internet routable too? (If that's the right terminology)
Mar 03 13:28:36 <Helenah>	Mine are internet routable.
Mar 03 13:29:12 <sheep>	IPv6 addresses issued by ISPs are almost always globally routable. That's one advantage of using IPv6 instead of using IPv4 with NAT like a lot of ISPs are doing
Mar 03 13:29:36 <Helenah>	sheep: They aren't NAT'd.
Mar 03 13:30:48 <raja>	Hello, I am using Arch Linux. I have an external Harddisk from WD. On initial mount, I had no issues on initial mount, I deleted some old files which I dont need now. Then unmounted(Actually I removed it without safe umount). Now when I am connecting again, its not mount and giving me an error like it cant mount due to bad super deadblocks something.
Mar 03 13:30:54 <raja>	is this familiar issue ?
Mar 03 13:31:07 <Helenah>	sheep: Most of my IPv4 space isn't NAT'd either (but one address).
Mar 03 13:31:36 <pell_>	raja: have you tried rebooting?
Mar 03 13:32:12 <raja>	pell_, yes. After reboot also same issue.
Mar 03 13:32:25 <raja>	As it is suggested, i checked dmesg logs.
Mar 03 13:32:48 <raja>	there it is suggested me to do with chkdsk which I believe not available in linux
Mar 03 13:33:25 <sheep>	what filesystem is it using? Is it NTFS?
Mar 03 13:33:33 <raja>	I believe yes.
Mar 03 13:33:52 <sheep>	you could try ntfsfix
Mar 03 13:34:15 <raja>	I read like I could lose data if I go with ntfsfix
Mar 03 13:34:27 <raja>	I cant lose the data, as it has valuable data.
Mar 03 13:34:50 <pell_>	Have you tried mounting to a different location?
Mar 03 13:36:10 <sheep>	"ntfsfix -n" will explain what it will change without actually doing anything
Mar 03 13:37:19 <raja>	sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/ele
Mar 03 13:37:19 <raja>	$MFTMirr does not match $MFT (record 3).
Mar 03 13:37:19 <raja>	Failed to mount '/dev/sda1': Input/output error
Mar 03 13:37:19 <raja>	NTFS is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault, or it's a
Mar 03 13:37:19 <raja>	SoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware. In the first case run chkdsk /f on Windows
Mar 03 13:37:21 <raja>	then reboot into Windows twice. The usage of the /f parameter is very
Mar 03 13:37:23 <raja>	important! If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate
Mar 03 13:37:27 <raja>	it and mount a different device under the /dev/mapper/ directory, (e.g.
Mar 03 13:37:29 <raja>	for more details.
Mar 03 13:37:31 <raja>	This is the error I am getting.
Mar 03 13:37:59 <Helenah>	raja: Please try to keep things on one line.
Mar 03 13:39:12 <raja>	Helenah, sorry
Mar 03 13:39:16 <Helenah>	No problem.
Mar 03 13:39:55 <sheep>	what to you get from "ntfsfix --no-action /dev/sda1"? If you get multiple lines, paste to https://paste.linux.chat/ then give us the link here
Mar 03 13:40:13 <sheep>	--no-action prevents it from changing anything
Mar 03 13:40:25 <pell_>	If it were a physical disk, I'd recommend SpinRite. but it's probably not I'm guessing
Mar 03 13:41:45 <Helenah>	Or even better, check for options at https://linux.chat/pastebin
Mar 03 13:43:05 <yustin>	blaa ... use termbin.com
Mar 03 13:43:17 <raja>	https://paste.linux.chat/?00413cd0ddd200d5#B2kzsehLXUm29TYJd7s7SvRxLws5B1PgVQiFeujxCyXn
Mar 03 13:43:48 <Helenah>	yustin: termbin is listed on there.
Mar 03 14:01:11 <raja>	pell_, you got a chance to look into the pastebin ?
Mar 03 14:01:15 <raja>	sheep, ^^
Mar 03 14:01:57 <sheep>	it looks like ntfsfix may attempt to use the alternate MFT, so ntfsfix /dev/sda might work. It looks lkke it isn't going to change anything else
Mar 03 14:02:24 <sheep>	still, if you have a windows system somewhere, you might want to try running chkdsk with that system
Mar 03 14:02:53 <raja>	installed windows on vm
Mar 03 14:03:00 <pell_>	raja: i haven't had to deal with this beyond the suggestions I've already made. I do hope you have a backup of the data
Mar 03 14:03:06 <raja>	do you think arch did something or my forceful unmount did this ?
Mar 03 14:03:13 <sheep>	the forceful unmount did it
Mar 03 14:03:14 <raja>	pell_, no, :(
Mar 03 14:03:38 <pell_>	probably the improper removal of the disk
Mar 03 14:03:51 <pell_>	it may have been doing a write at the moment
Mar 03 14:04:27 <genericum>	I have a notebook with apentium n6000 but battery life in Linux is very low. Cpupower doesn't load the userspace governor. What to do?
Mar 03 14:06:16 <genericum>	Plenty devices in sys/acpi ...
Mar 03 14:11:08 <pell_>	raja: yeah, i've only recently started doing routine backups after years of "i'll get around to it"
Mar 03 14:14:20 <pell_>	raja: last night somebody fixed a similar problem with testdisk. might be worth a look
Mar 03 14:38:46 <Helenah>	IPv6 is making me flip tables.

Mar 03 15:04:47 <wiz>	thanks
Mar 03 15:07:23 <wantyapps>	wiz: Very useful information.
Mar 03 15:08:10 <sedzcat>	Howdy
Mar 03 15:08:13 <wantyapps>	I tried the emacs IRC client yesterday. I hate the config
Mar 03 15:08:16 <wantyapps>	howdy sedzcat
Mar 03 15:08:26 <sedzcat>	We need a new ISO from Chimera Linux!
Mar 03 15:08:39 <wantyapps>	What is chimera linux?
Mar 03 15:08:54 <sedzcat>	https://chimera-linux.org/
Mar 03 15:08:56 <wantyapps>	thanks
Mar 03 15:09:03 <sedzcat>	The future of Linux looool
Mar 03 15:09:19 <wantyapps>	:)
Mar 03 15:09:49 <wantyapps>	sedzcat: site looks nice
Mar 03 15:09:54 <sedzcat>	The features are very cool
Mar 03 15:10:07 <wantyapps>	I don't see screenshots in the official site
Mar 03 15:10:08 <sedzcat>	Yeah, nice website wantyapps
Mar 03 15:10:26 <sedzcat>	Look at the features
Mar 03 15:10:29 <wantyapps>	sedzcat: looks very macOS
Mar 03 15:11:10 *	wantyapps doesn't like macOS look-alikes
Mar 03 15:11:22 <sedzcat>	Uses GNOME, Dinit, apk tools as package manager AND a FreeBSD userland
Mar 03 15:13:08 <sedzcat>	I can't imagine the impressive work to build Chimera Linux
Mar 03 15:13:27 <sedzcat>	Without using Systemd nowadays
Mar 03 15:17:20 <xiaomiao>	sedzcat: you'd be surprised
Mar 03 15:18:16 <ski>	wantyapps : ooc, which of them ?
Mar 03 15:18:32 <ski>	(erc, rcirc, or circe ?)
Mar 03 15:18:54 <peac>	interesting to have a non-gnu linux out there, i do like gnu but that didn't exist before afaik
Mar 03 15:19:15 <sedzcat>	Very interesting project, when I first noticed about Chimera Linux made me think twice about my Linux Project Libero GNU/Linux
Mar 03 15:19:27 <sedzcat>	peac, cool stuff!
Mar 03 15:19:58 <pell_>	I don't know when chimera started, but there are alternatives to GNU tools. BSD tools, Busybox
Mar 03 15:20:42 <pell_>	MUSL for c libraries
Mar 03 15:20:45 <sedzcat>	pell_ it started in 2021 I guess but the whole concept was earlier
Mar 03 15:20:56 <peac>	busybox is probably the default in some distros yes, but i didn't hear about bsd userland being packaged with linux before
Mar 03 15:21:55 <gog>	there used to be a debain gnu/kFreeBsd
Mar 03 15:22:01 <gog>	the other way around
Mar 03 15:22:07 <sedzcat>	True
Mar 03 15:22:30 <n4dir>	probably systemd was the end to it
Mar 03 15:22:56 <peac>	many distros still don't use systemd
Mar 03 15:23:00 <gog>	gnu userland doesn't depend on systemd
Mar 03 15:23:06 <n4dir>	it was pretty nice, as in: easy to run. debian/hurd was not that easy
Mar 03 15:23:28 <frib>	BIOS was forcing me to manually select my boot drive every time because "GPT header was corrupt". It recommended using BIOS auto recovery of the header, so I did. I no longer have to manually select the boot disk but now my RAID 5 array will not mount because it "can't read superblock on /dev/md2"
Mar 03 15:23:51 <frib>	Is it possibly to fix the superblock without losing data?
Mar 03 15:23:54 <peac>	that's pretty bad
Mar 03 15:24:02 <frib>	possible*
Mar 03 15:24:11 <gog>	do you know if your partition entries changed at all
Mar 03 15:24:24 <frib>	I think it's the same
Mar 03 15:24:32 <peac>	theoretically you could erase aad rewrite the header, but 200% make backups before
Mar 03 15:24:54 <frib>	mdadm --detail and lsblk look like they're showing the same information as before
Mar 03 15:25:09 <frib>	I can back up the header but I have no way of backing up the data
Mar 03 15:25:17 <gog>	it's raid 5 you say tho? can you rebuild from parity
Mar 03 15:25:26 <gog>	but maybe that's what corrupted your GPT header
Mar 03 15:25:49 <frib>	If I knew one disk was a problem I could rebuild from parity but I really don't even know what happened
Mar 03 15:25:55 <peac>	the data will stay where it is, so as long as you can rebuild your metadata correctly it should work
Mar 03 15:26:23 <frib>	peac, it can't hurt to try to rebuild the metadata at this point right? assuming it won't change the data anyway?
Mar 03 15:26:29 <frib>	I just don't know how
Mar 03 15:27:26 <peac>	what's the layout of your array ?
Mar 03 15:30:18 <frib>	its RAID 5 of 3 drives: sda, sdb, and md1
Mar 03 15:30:24 <frib>	each are 2 TB
Mar 03 15:31:19 <peac>	what's the filesystem ?
Mar 03 15:31:21 <frib>	md1 is composed of sdc, sdd and sdf
Mar 03 15:31:25 <frib>	it was ext4
Mar 03 15:31:31 <peac>	still is ?
Mar 03 15:31:45 <frib>	it should be yes
Mar 03 15:32:03 <peac>	can you post mdadm --detail
Mar 03 15:32:09 <frib>	dev/md2 /mnt/md2 ext4 defaults,nofail,discard,rw,user,exec 0 0
Mar 03 15:32:12 <frib>	thats from fstab
Mar 03 15:33:18 <frib>	https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/rpshPYmwd4/
Mar 03 15:33:38 <frib>	sorry thats not a good paste location
Mar 03 15:33:38 <peac>	please use privatebin, i'd need to login to see that
Mar 03 15:34:16 <frib>	https://privatebin.net/?65d8e3ab8fb4fbc5#8ZUfJoYTNFm2A3Pa7t5gtYvAPyvjf8gvgcjNGUBridVm
Mar 03 15:35:09 <frib>	That's for the raid components, here is for the raid itself (/dev/md2)
Mar 03 15:35:22 <frib>	https://privatebin.net/?cb136c43938e0ec8#9sFvviJXiRwYJJULuS71Yp5teEGeFZ9BiSZLsjbhbrqt
Mar 03 15:36:22 <peac>	so md1 is an array and it's a part of md2 ? why is that ?
Mar 03 15:36:34 <frib>	because it was all I could afford
Mar 03 15:37:26 <peac>	so i'm guessing you don't have backups ?
Mar 03 15:37:32 <frib>	no
Mar 03 15:37:40 <peac>	how much data in there ?
Mar 03 15:37:54 <frib>	it was 5.4T capacity, 17% used
Mar 03 15:38:15 <peac>	so 1T
Mar 03 15:38:28 <frib>	maybe a little more, give or take I'm not sure exactly, but about yes
Mar 03 15:38:59 <peac>	for the record, when making a storage array, you should think of it as half its capacity because you need backups
Mar 03 15:39:12 <peac>	even with raid5 as you can experience
Mar 03 15:39:30 <peac>	did you try to fsck the md2 ?
Mar 03 15:39:40 <frib>	I believe so I should try again though
Mar 03 15:39:58 <frib>	The superblock could not be read or does not describe a valid ext2/ext3/ext4
Mar 03 15:39:58 <frib>	filesystem.
Mar 03 15:40:12 <frib>	If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2/ext3/ext4
Mar 03 15:40:12 <frib>	filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
Mar 03 15:40:12 <frib>	is corrupt,
Mar 03 15:40:28 <peac>	paste output please
Mar 03 15:40:48 <frib>	https://privatebin.net/?7453cb2366401519#7yAYRDMV62V44g9MQkpz1GiU947osHDBDPukgmXQgPxd
Mar 03 15:41:32 <peac>	you can try that advice
Mar 03 15:41:50 <frib>	I thought I did but maybe I did it wrong
Mar 03 15:42:31 <frib>	I guess you mean   e2fsck -b 8193 /dev/md2 right?
Mar 03 15:42:42 <peac>	yes and the other one
Mar 03 15:42:50 <frib>	they both give me the same output as before
Mar 03 15:44:28 <peac>	https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/41946
Mar 03 15:46:21 <frib>	ok what should I use for the blocksize?
Mar 03 15:47:04 <frib>	4096?
Mar 03 15:49:16 <peac>	what does testdisk say ?
Mar 03 15:50:54 <peac>	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery
Mar 03 15:52:09 <Gurkenglas>	What's the usual way for a user-level program to create a log that can be read by root but not by user-level programs?
Mar 03 15:52:37 <peac>	which program, one you're making ?
Mar 03 15:52:52 <Gurkenglas>	yes, hypothetically
Mar 03 15:52:56 <rbox>	Gurkenglas: set the permissions so the user can write it but not read it
Mar 03 15:53:21 <rbox>	and owened by root
Mar 03 15:53:56 <peac>	rwx-w--- root:user
Mar 03 15:54:10 <peac>	you don't even need x actually
Mar 03 15:54:52 <frib>	- /dev/md2 is not listed in testdisk
Mar 03 15:55:36 <peac>	you're going to have to do a leap of faith and use recovery tools if that doesn't work
Mar 03 15:56:07 <frib>	you mean mke2fs -S ?
Mar 03 15:56:17 <peac>	that's the only solution i can see
Mar 03 15:56:41 <frib>	I don't understand why /dev/md1 is listed in test disk but not /dev/md2
Mar 03 15:56:59 <peac>	md1 is healthy as far as i can tell
Mar 03 15:57:02 <Gurkenglas>	shouldn't he make a dd backup first?
Mar 03 15:57:16 <peac>	he should, it was mentioned before
Mar 03 15:57:25 <frib>	I don't have a place to make a backup
Mar 03 15:57:44 <peac>	you could use a cheap storage box online and mount it locally
Mar 03 15:57:45 <Gurkenglas>	ah, okay. it looks like handing ownership of the file over to root takes root permissions, why is that?
Mar 03 15:58:27 <frib>	and make individual dd backups of every drive in the array?
Mar 03 15:59:06 <peac>	can you dd md2 ?
Mar 03 15:59:49 <peac>	i must mention this is at the fringe ofmy own knowledge
Mar 03 15:59:58 <frib>	dd if=/dev/md2 of=~/test bs=1 count=1
Mar 03 16:00:05 <peac>	yes
Mar 03 16:00:05 <frib>	Like this for example?
Mar 03 16:00:18 <Gurkenglas>	can he make a *partial* dd copy and try to mke2fs that one instead?
Mar 03 16:00:28 <frib>	every vale is 0, 0 recordss in /out, 0 bytes copied
Mar 03 16:03:53 <peac>	Gurkenglas: i also thought changing the owner to root was possible but it's indeed designed not to be possible without being root
Mar 03 16:08:56 <zanoh>	Morning
Mar 03 16:10:38 <VecT0r_X>	hello
Mar 03 16:10:39 <frib>	Ok I forgot 2TB are for parity so actually my array had 4 components
Mar 03 16:10:49 <zanoh>	Hi there VecT0r_X
Mar 03 16:10:54 <frib>	Now mdadm --detail says 3, which is wrong
Mar 03 16:11:07 <VecT0r_X>	hello zanoh
Mar 03 16:11:22 <wantyapps>	frib: :)
Mar 03 16:11:38 <joo>	borg diff takes the following argument: REPO::ARCHIVE1 ARCHIVE2 - what is REPO?
Mar 03 16:12:03 <frib>	I'm screwed lol
Mar 03 16:18:48 <frib>	This was my drive layout before everything got messed up: https://privatebin.net/?c06008f63c8043b9#2vLm8Fc6Uvm5jc8eqpKhxTvPyint1q6hwriimfngB5qw
Mar 03 16:19:16 <frib>	My BIOS wouldn't automatically boot the boot drive so I followed its advice for "auto recovery of the corrupt GPT header"
Mar 03 16:19:52 <frib>	now the 8T raid5 (2T = parity) will not mount (corrupt superblock)
Mar 03 16:20:14 <frib>	lsblk output: https://privatebin.net/?18f734a12c530046#HqLtmjrccMJtPSM465YcnD1AhVujzdTMrSWDtFKCU3P9
Mar 03 16:22:19 <frib>	mdadm --examine for all drives: https://privatebin.net/?9c03cff1f3526414#3LLuoHdT1XozPU3R5JBM7VhgpTefk5xww7beuDMAEsoX
Mar 03 16:23:58 <frib>	is it possible to restore my array?

Mar 04 05:05:28 <r-zan>	I have learned : Never use IRC in a browser client while on mobile
Mar 04 05:05:40 <rbox>	s/while on mobile//
Mar 04 05:05:53 <r-zan>	Because I'll accidentally start a war and disconnect mid-way through
Mar 04 05:17:44 <sheep>	mobile apps are bad at keeping connections and unlike most modern chat protocols, IRC doesn't separate user sessions from TCP connections
Mar 04 05:19:03 <aquanox>	ls
Mar 04 05:22:00 <cytokine_storm>	hello
Mar 04 05:22:08 <whiskey76>	o/
Mar 04 05:22:15 <cytokine_storm>	what is the size approximately. https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/snapshot/linux-firmware-20240220.tar.gz
Mar 04 05:22:42 <cytokine_storm>	i have data problem so can someone guess the size :)
Mar 04 05:22:59 <rbox>	10
Mar 04 05:23:10 <cytokine_storm>	10 what
Mar 04 05:23:15 <cytokine_storm>	10G ?
Mar 04 05:23:17 <n4dir>	well, i could download it and say the exact size, or is it important to guess?
Mar 04 05:24:30 <rbox>	12?
Mar 04 05:24:32 <cytokine_storm>	n4dir: yeah i have data problem i need the approx size
Mar 04 05:24:32 <cytokine_storm>	yes
Mar 04 05:24:56 <ayecee>	the approx size isn't available.
Mar 04 05:25:06 <ayecee>	you'll have to download it to find out.
Mar 04 05:25:31 <JakLareo>	r-zan: have you ever looked into TheLounge? It's an IRC client that you can self-host on some machine that can stay connected, and it has a rather nice PWA interface that works well on phones. It makes IRC on my phone a surprisingly good experience.
Mar 04 05:25:32 <n4dir>	cytokine_storm: and the exact size won't help you? Weird
Mar 04 05:25:32 <cytokine_storm>	ayecee: yeah i guess thats what it is. so it is what it is
Mar 04 05:25:39 <ayecee>	it sure is
Mar 04 05:26:02 <ayecee>	n4dir: well i mean if you're willing to do that, i guess that'd help.
Mar 04 05:26:26 <cytokine_storm>	ok ok guys srry for bothering you all :p
Mar 04 05:26:51 *	n4dir waits for it to finish
Mar 04 05:27:02 <cytokine_storm>	last time in 2019 the size was ~300Mb. but now its way past it
Mar 04 05:27:04 <n4dir>	i guess that means it isn't small
Mar 04 05:27:14 <cytokine_storm>	n4dir: yes yes
Mar 04 05:27:20 <r-zan>	JakLareo: I havent actually, but admittedly... I'm pretty new to IRC as a whole. Only recently started poking around with it
Mar 04 05:27:33 <hnOsmium0001>	r-zan: I use weechat running 24/7 on a server, and connects to it with glowing-bear; less featureful than the above suggested TheLounge but lighter on the serve
Mar 04 05:27:39 <n4dir>	cytokine_storm: damnit, i assumed it is rather small. But now i will let it finish
Mar 04 05:28:02 <hnOsmium0001>	although it was pretty confusing trying to get the relay settings initially
Mar 04 05:28:08 <cytokine_storm>	n4dir: ok ok thanks btw. it will help :D
Mar 04 05:28:10 <n4dir>	535M    linux-firmware-20240220.tar.gz
Mar 04 05:28:31 <hnOsmium0001>	weechat docs are not the most discoverable and easy to read text ever
Mar 04 05:29:06 <cytokine_storm>	n4dir cool cool updating my script. many many thanks
Mar 04 05:29:18 <hnOsmium0001>	and quite frankly I don't remember any details of that process! I just know it works with whatever is configured and should continue to do so'
Mar 04 05:29:19 <n4dir>	cytokine_storm: no problem, really not.
Mar 04 05:38:17 <de-facto>	hmm trying to compile a lib, when loading it i get undefined symbol: _ZN7viterbi9CCDecoderC1EiiiSt6vectorIiSaIiEEii
Mar 04 05:38:21 <de-facto>	what could cause that?
Mar 04 05:38:34 <de-facto>	its a .so loaded by a ELF binary
Mar 04 05:38:47 <ayecee>	maybe aliens
Mar 04 05:39:02 <ayecee>	hey, what number am i thinking of?
Mar 04 05:39:43 <ayecee>	there's a book on the counter. what could cause that?
Mar 04 05:40:19 <ayecee>	ok, i'm done. consider looking at the messages before the last error.
Mar 04 05:42:57 *	de-facto refuses to believe its random, it probably needs to have some symbol table included or such
Mar 04 05:43:10 <ayecee>	we may never know for sure
Mar 04 05:52:54 <hnOsmium0001>	de-facto: that demangles to `viterbi::CCDecoder::CCDecoder(int, int, int, std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >, int, int)`
Mar 04 05:53:40 <rbox>	hnOsmium0001: you're a viterbi
Mar 04 05:53:52 <hnOsmium0001>	other than that I'm not sure which library is this related to
Mar 04 05:54:49 <de-facto>	oh wow i didnt know that symbols are mapped like this
Mar 04 05:55:04 <hnOsmium0001>	you can run `c++filt` on whatever mangled symbol you have to get it back
Mar 04 05:55:12 *	rbox mangles the channel
Mar 04 05:55:15 <hnOsmium0001>	or the LLVM equivalent one that I don't remember what it's called
Mar 04 05:55:38 <hnOsmium0001>	for itanium ABI mangles, if you have something from MSVC you need something else
Mar 04 05:57:47 <de-facto>	hnOsmium0001, you are correct its the constructor it seems at https://github.com/cropinghigh/sdrpp-dvbs-demodulator/blob/266412b68c50b26b472b3f181bd21eff367d79ab/src/demod/dvbs/viterbi/cc_decoder.cpp#L10
Mar 04 05:58:46 <hnOsmium0001>	apparently the LLVM one is called `llvm-cxxfilt`
Mar 04 06:03:14 <de-facto>	hmm maybe i need to add more of those directories to cmake?
Mar 04 06:05:05 <AntonoiCarpio>	anyone here tried zram? is it effective?
Mar 04 06:07:15 <rbox>	AntonoiCarpio: what do you mean effective?
Mar 04 06:09:35 <AntonoiCarpio>	rbox: lets see, like in low memory situations where instead a GUI hangs until OOM kicks in, it will still be responsive
Mar 04 06:09:54 <rbox>	well you've got more virtual memory
Mar 04 06:09:56 <rbox>	overall...
Mar 04 06:10:41 <rbox>	and its faster than swap on disk
Mar 04 06:11:33 <AntonoiCarpio>	problem I have is, in a typical GNU Linux desktop, under low memory situations, even if you have the swapspace, the desktop tends to freeze a bit until OOM kicks in. Was wondering if zram can help that (assuming anyone here has tried it)
Mar 04 06:12:07 <rbox>	its default on a ton of dists
Mar 04 06:12:08 <rbox>	lol
Mar 04 06:12:12 <AntonoiCarpio>	oh
Mar 04 06:12:12 <rbox>	its not some special magical thing
Mar 04 06:12:13 <AntonoiCarpio>	lmao
Mar 04 06:12:14 <Affliction>	It'll delay the inevitable, if you have something continuously eating memory.
Mar 04 06:12:17 <Affliction>	But, it's not magic.
Mar 04 06:12:29 <AntonoiCarpio>	sad
Mar 04 06:12:42 <rbox>	if you keep running out of ram
Mar 04 06:12:43 <rbox>	you need more ram
Mar 04 06:12:47 <Affliction>	^
Mar 04 06:12:56 <Affliction>	It's better than swapping to disk, though, yeah.
Mar 04 06:13:09 <Affliction>	But, it's really not ideal to Rely on swap.
Mar 04 06:13:12 <Affliction>	zram or otherwise
Mar 04 06:13:27 <rbox>	i have 380mb of zram swap used
Mar 04 06:13:58 <Affliction>	sure, if those are pages that are never used, no problem there
Mar 04 06:15:09 <Affliction>	I mean, if the memory actively being hit is overflowing into swap too, so you have many pages going betweein main and swap, you'll want more memory.
Mar 04 06:15:32 <de-facto>	yep that was it, had to add the directory to cmake for the symbol to be included
Mar 04 06:15:33 <AntonoiCarpio>	i wanna copy window's behavior where under low memory situations, the system will gradually eat your disk space as a gap filler for the missing ram. Im was under the assumption zram does that but oh well
Mar 04 06:15:44 <de-facto>	so ayecee we know for sure
Mar 04 06:15:51 <Affliction>	AntonoiCarpio: zram doesn't use disk at all
Mar 04 06:15:59 <Affliction>	You can pair zram with swap on disk.
Mar 04 06:16:13 <AntonoiCarpio>	hmmh
Mar 04 06:16:21 <Affliction>	And I vaguely recall there being a tool out there that dynamically adds and removes swap files based on swap usage, though I don't recall what it was called.
Mar 04 06:16:23 <AntonoiCarpio>	i guess zram + dynamic swapfile is closest
Mar 04 06:17:11 <rbox>	if you're running out of ram
Mar 04 06:17:13 <rbox>	you need more ram
Mar 04 06:17:15 <rbox>	its not that c omplicated
Mar 04 06:17:37 <AntonoiCarpio>	thankfully it is if you have a craptop that has solder ram slots
Mar 04 06:17:55 <rbox>	then stop tryign to use too much r am
Mar 04 06:18:28 <Affliction>	Yeah, might have to slim down your workload on that machine, or accept that it's no longer fit for purpose.
Mar 04 06:18:44 <AntonoiCarpio>	oh its definitely retiring, not just yet
Mar 04 06:18:47 <Affliction>	Personally I stick with either a small zram or swap file that might take up those "rarely used" pages, and if that fills up, or is thrashing, I'd definitely consider upgrading if that workload needs to be sustained.
Mar 04 06:20:15 <n4dir>	zrythm, zram, it is all the same to me
Mar 04 06:44:32 <birkoff>	how to choose between LTS kernels versions ?
Mar 04 06:46:53 <preach>	eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Mar 04 06:47:07 <Disconsented>	Latest
Mar 04 06:47:29 <Disconsented>	Unless you have a reason to otherwise do so, default to latest
Mar 04 07:14:59 <birkoff>	how can I know the period of support for an LTS ?
Mar 04 07:15:39 <Lolo>	call
Mar 04 07:16:52 <birkoff>	what's their hotline ? :-0
Mar 04 07:17:40 <wantyapps>	Hallo
Mar 04 07:42:49 <Norkle>	:]
Mar 04 07:49:12 <virginiasplane>	Got curious so I'm asking: How many people here are adjusting their swappiness? The default on a Debian system is 60. You can adjust it in /etc/sysctl.conf. The line looks like this: vm.swappiness=40...
Mar 04 07:50:15 <virginiasplane>	I think if you don't adjust it, at least on Ubuntu, it's not even there. You have to add it ... But anyway, I changed mine from 60 to 40 and if I have to guess, people don't mess with it... you can render your system unstable if the swappiness doesn't meet the demands of something like i/o wait, memory preassure etc.
Mar 04 07:50:55 <wantyapps>	Norkle: :]
Mar 04 07:51:26 <wantyapps>	virginiasplane: I have swap allocated, but never get to use it. Never thought about it
Mar 04 07:51:29 <virginiasplane>	I think what sir wantyapps has said has nothing to do with swappiness but it is interesting. "Norkle" to you as well
Mar 04 07:51:52 <wantyapps>	:))
Mar 04 07:52:01 <virginiasplane>	I mean, for normal people who actually aren't cheap bastards like me or broke ... you buy enough physical RAM
Mar 04 07:52:21 <r-zan>	tbh, I dont know why I got 32GB of ram
Mar 04 07:52:26 <r-zan>	I never come anywhere close to using it
Mar 04 07:53:16 <virginiasplane>	You shouldn't have to create swap files. I only have them because if I didn't, my VMs wouldn't run and the system would either freeze all the time or just wouldn't open any number of apps. I'm not much for Windows obviously ... but on something like Windows, you don't really have a choice. If the memory isn't there, it just won't work... You can adjust paging on Windows but I don't think it's as flexible as swap on Linux
Mar 04 07:53:49 <virginiasplane>	I have 15GB of RAM
Mar 04 07:54:37 <virginiasplane>	I have ... to be exact: 15GB RAM, 15GB of partitioned swap and two swap files, 15GB and 10GB ... oh, and a third swap file
Mar 04 07:54:43 <virginiasplane>	I'll tell you what the third is... let me turn it on
Mar 04 07:54:46 <wantyapps>	virginiasplane: how do you get an odd number of GB RAM? Sounds.. odd
Mar 04 07:54:56 <r-zan>	*ba dum pshhh*
Mar 04 07:55:03 <wantyapps>	:D
Mar 04 07:55:10 <virginiasplane>	*fourth, if you consider the first partition file a swwap file and it more-or-less is. The system says it is a partiion but only because it's zram
Mar 04 07:55:17 <wantyapps>	Whoa
Mar 04 07:55:29 <n4dir>	 did anyone ask for that wall of unrelated info?
Mar 04 07:55:38 <virginiasplane>	OK, so the fourth swap space is 10GB
Mar 04 07:55:58 <virginiasplane>	So, there is 15GB of physical RAM and ... 50GB of swap
Mar 04 07:56:06 <virginiasplane>	Your mom did
Mar 04 07:56:16 <virginiasplane>	So, every time I give it to her, she asks me for my stats.
Mar 04 07:56:30 <virginiasplane>	And me wanting to keep it clean, I try to... you know, wink wink... I keep it tech related
Mar 04 07:56:45 <n4dir>	it is nice you discovered a new toy, but it would be nice to keep it to yourself.
Mar 04 07:58:02 <virginiasplane>	You get an odd number ... so on the 15? No, that's not super weird... Let me think for a second. OK, so it looks like if I check on Amazon, the first thing that comes up is 16GB and not 15
Mar 04 07:59:07 <Affliction>	It can be done with mismatched modules, I know someone who used to run a rather weird config involving 6 different mismatched modules (in the original Nehalem board which was tri-channel)
Mar 04 07:59:40 <Affliction>	But yeah, I generally leave swappiness at the default. Seems to be reasonable for me.
Mar 04 08:01:00 <Affliction>	It'll start writing "inactive" pages to swap even before it starts evicting them, iirc. No perf hit there, then when you really hit memory pressure, the pages already written can be evicted immediately.
Mar 04 08:03:59 <Affliction>	I used to tune it down on servers; the idea being they should have enough real RAM for their workload, and swap is more "emergency overflow", but today, meh.
Mar 04 08:04:40 <Affliction>	NVMe can eat those writes much better than mechanical disks
Mar 04 08:04:41 <virginiasplane>	I actually got on here because I was bored but ... To answer that question and because that one twat asked me why I announce things outloud... I have 16GB but the free command, among other tools reads it as 15
Mar 04 08:04:48 <virginiasplane>	Shit gets rounded off boys and girls
Mar 04 08:05:16 <Affliction>	Yeah, lose a few megs for hardware and firmware reservations.
Mar 04 08:13:50 <cructacean>	Good mourning everyone :-)
Mar 04 08:14:05 <VecT0r_X>	helly cruct
Mar 04 08:14:09 <VecT0r_X>	hello*
Mar 04 08:14:29 <whiskey76>	o/
Mar 04 08:14:48 <cructacean>	I prefer helly - sums me up well enough ;-)
Mar 04 08:15:52 <cructacean>	I am back with a new registered name in my continued search for an HTTP server to run on my newly aquired hardware
Mar 04 08:16:17 <hnOsmium0001>	isn't that called nginx? :P
Mar 04 08:16:24 <k4k0>	https://paste.linux.chat/?0e2601dec1fc9a73#6Tt1UKZZi4ZFb9DZKCWZ5qpCTtCCtYtggmjbAw1GiVcA
Mar 04 08:16:26 <cructacean>	o/ whisky76
Mar 04 08:16:28 <k4k0>	Would it be interesting to update or not?
Mar 04 08:16:36 <hnOsmium0001>	(unless by newly aquired hardware you mean an iron ingot)
Mar 04 08:16:40 <hnOsmium0001>	(in which case I can't help you)
Mar 04 08:17:08 <cructacean>	mayhaps <hnOsmium0001
Mar 04 08:17:53 <cructacean>	my ingots are all lead (I turned them from gold (am bad alchemist)
Mar 04 08:17:59 <cructacean>	;-)
Mar 04 08:18:07 <k4k0>	Would it be interesting to update or not? hum
Mar 04 08:18:36 <cructacean>	yyes I am working with caddy for now
Mar 04 08:19:34 <cructacean>	I now need to run an http server and use caddy to send out a wep page (that would be a start
Mar 04 08:21:26 <Affliction>	cructacean: I guess it depends on your requirements, ultimately. I've never used caddy, looks like it deals in static content and can also act as a reverse proxy for an app server.
Mar 04 08:22:19 <cructacean>	I looked at samba, am still learning again how to use hexchat, samba is no use to me not interested in widows or windows users, sorry MS drones
Mar 04 08:22:40 <Affliction>	Samba's completely unrelated to http
Mar 04 08:22:48 <cructacean>	yes reverse proxy is what I may need ...
Mar 04 08:23:26 <cructacean>	indeed affliction it was one of the dead fish I followed and abandoned
Mar 04 08:25:09 <k4k0>	https://paste.linux.chat/?0e2601dec1fc9a73#6Tt1UKZZi4ZFb9DZKCWZ5qpCTtCCtYtggmjbAw1GiVcA
Mar 04 08:25:11 <k4k0>	Would it be interesting to update or not? hum
Mar 04 08:25:38 <Affliction>	k4k0: only you can answer that question. If it's not getting security updates, and is connected to the internet, it's probably a good idea.
Mar 04 08:26:28 <Affliction>	I think there's an #ubuntu you can ask for considerations when upgrading.
Mar 04 08:26:44 <k4k0>	I have no problem, everything is working normally, I was just scared of this update alert that was no longer supported, other than that everything is ok
Mar 04 08:27:04 <k4k0>	I guess I'd better wait for an LTS version then.
Mar 04 08:28:36 <Affliction>	23.04; next LTS will be 24.04, it's been over a decade since I've used ubuntu personally, but will you need to go through 23.10 anyway?
Mar 04 08:28:49 <hnOsmium0001>	the really nice thing about caddy is that it has a builtin webdav module
Mar 04 08:29:09 <hnOsmium0001>	when I set up nginx for webdav a while ago, obtaining the webdav addon was a pain in itself
Mar 04 08:30:39 <cructacean>	I did look at nginx briefly, it is on the back burned as it may be beyond my present requirements
Mar 04 08:30:56 <Affliction>	Yeah, I'm a long term nginx user from before it was cool. Modules can be a pain on some distros.
Mar 04 08:31:13 <k4k0>	Affliction idk
Mar 04 08:31:23 <Affliction>	Debian seems to have most of what I need.
Mar 04 08:31:30 <cructacean>	I am using manjaro and it tried to keep me safe (probably a good thing) but frustrating
Mar 04 08:31:50 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 04 08:31:51 *	litharge sets ban on $a:Batzy$##fix_your_connection
Mar 04 08:32:01 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 04 08:32:22 <Affliction>	k4k0: Might want to ask #ubuntu for advice, and other coniserations around upgrades then.
Mar 04 08:32:27 <colo>	Affliction: lasty I checked, you can upgrade from LTS to LTS directly (maybe only after the newer LTS release's .1 was done), and from the previous release to the current release.
Mar 04 08:32:46 <AntonoiCarpio>	you're better off with ubuntu
Mar 04 08:32:53 <AntonoiCarpio>	#ubuntu for ubuntu related support
Mar 04 08:33:08 <cructacean>	I likes Debian but like to pretend I am advanced enough to use an Arch based rolling distro
Mar 04 08:35:40 <Affliction>	I run debian on most of my servers, arch on my desktop and laptop.
Mar 04 08:36:05 <Affliction>	Running arch directly will teach you a lot, even if you're not currently advanced. But yeah, it's not for everyone.
Mar 04 08:36:12 <k4k0>	k
Mar 04 08:36:14 <Affliction>	I'm not going to shame people for their choice in distro!
Mar 04 08:40:36 <cructacean>	basically I only use command line when I have to ... hence Manjaro. You are right about servers running stable with Debian but I will continue with my current tools and hardware for now ...
Mar 04 08:41:09 <Affliction>	Yeah, if it works, why change?
Mar 04 08:41:48 <cructacean>	You got Affliction ;-)
Mar 04 08:41:58 <cructacean>	got it
Mar 04 08:43:21 <AntonoiCarpio>	Affliction: will you judge me if i use hannah montana linux?
Mar 04 08:43:36 <cructacean>	so for example I changed from Pidgin which did not work on my laptop and frankly for now was bloatware
Mar 04 08:44:14 <cructacean>	hexchat is working on both computers quite adequate to my needs ....
Mar 04 08:44:15 <Affliction>	AntonoiCarpio: Is it still getting security support? If so, nope! As long as you're serious about it and not just using it as a gimmick :D
Mar 04 08:44:30 <AntonoiCarpio>	sad
Mar 04 08:45:08 <cructacean>	I judge everyone as comedians until they start being too serious
Mar 04 08:45:52 <cructacean>	Oh my lordy, there is such a distro?
Mar 04 08:46:26 <cructacean>	It is the end of civilisation as we think it might be :D
Mar 04 08:47:02 <Affliction>	RebeccaBlackOS is better :)
Mar 04 09:05:23 <louipc>	no
Mar 04 09:51:17 <hacknorris>	back with same cd problem. inspected hellish thunar and got this in logs (after really many tries of different cd writer apps):
Mar 04 09:51:26 <hacknorris>	[ 1717.187479] I/O error, dev sr0, sector 64 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x0 phys_seg 1 prio class 2
Mar 04 10:07:43 <hacknorris>	nvm. it was just bad cd
Mar 04 10:20:00 <ubuntu>	hello anyone here?
Mar 04 10:21:31 <Guest6751>	no one on right now?
Mar 04 10:22:18 <luna_>	yep
Mar 04 10:24:12 <Inline>	someone greets anybody and smirks nobody
Mar 04 10:29:05 <whiskey76>	o/
Mar 04 10:29:10 <luna_>	\o
Mar 04 10:34:47 <Lolo>	luna_, GN!
Mar 04 10:36:15 <luna_>	GN?
Mar 04 10:45:09 <Lolo>	nu ti i luna
Mar 04 10:56:15 <lemonzest>	Moo :D
Mar 04 10:59:25 <test924>	Is there a way to revert the configuration of gnome-system-monitor to all defaults?I think it keeps all of its setting in the gsettings backend.
Mar 04 11:05:52 <test924>	looks like the best solution might be 'gsettings reset-recursively'
Mar 04 11:08:25 <test924>	that seems like a good one to know
Mar 04 11:20:35 <hackinghorn>	hey
Mar 04 11:20:43 <luna_>	hi
Mar 04 11:21:17 <hackinghorn>	good day!
Mar 04 12:00:21 <Guts71>	Can I use linuxcnc under debian with wsl of windows 10 ?
Mar 04 12:01:16 <djph>	Guts71: I doubt it
Mar 04 12:23:45 <livingbeef>	I think MS is planning to implement something like pci passthrough.
Mar 04 12:24:24 <livingbeef>	might be for win11 only
Mar 04 12:26:30 <Affliction>	Would surprise me if hyper-v doesn't support that already?
Mar 04 12:27:42 <Affliction>	Yeah, but only on Windows Server SKUs.
Mar 04 12:41:33 <tercaL>	Got a strange issue; every 30 minutes, wget deletes my media library (website), any clue on this?
Mar 04 12:42:45 <livingbeef>	I meant for wsl, I assume it can already do that for VMs
Mar 04 12:43:19 <Affliction>	livingbeef: AIUI WSL2 is "Just Another Hyper-V VM" with some paravirt integration.
Mar 04 12:43:27 <Affliction>	WSL1, yeah, that was a different NT subsystem.
Mar 04 12:47:01 <ananke>	tercaL: yeah. provide more context/info, this is not sufficient.
Mar 04 12:52:39 <Guts71>	Can we use classic linux and linuxcnc on debian?
Mar 04 12:54:53 <tercaL>	ananke: my wordpress's media content folder (image files) are getting deleted by the wget process. How to investigate this on Linux VPS?
Mar 04 12:55:34 <ananke>	tercaL: what makes you believe they are 'deleted by the wget process'? what wget process?
Mar 04 12:55:39 <tercaL>	a personal photography website with tons of images
Mar 04 12:57:07 <djph>	tercaL: so why're you running wget to delete images?
Mar 04 13:00:06 <ananke>	at this rate we'll get relevant information sometime in June
Mar 04 13:00:15 <circuitbone>	tercaL:  considered piwigo instead?
Mar 04 13:03:23 <ananke>	that's like suggesting to change car brands, because you have a flat tire
Mar 04 13:08:24 <zanoh>	Good morning friends. And zoidberg.
Mar 04 13:11:12 <hangint3n>	good morning ladies and gents
Mar 04 13:11:17 <zanoh>	G'Day
Mar 04 13:11:39 <whiskey76>	o/
Mar 04 13:11:54 <sigvart>	o/
Mar 04 13:12:00 <zanoh>	o7
Mar 04 13:12:04 <hangint3n>	o/
Mar 04 13:12:52 <hangint3n>	what r we discussing today?
Mar 04 13:13:20 <zanoh>	Whatever you want to. :)
Mar 04 13:13:35 <AntonoiCarpio>	i wanna discuss
Mar 04 13:13:35 <AntonoiCarpio>	DRM on linux
Mar 04 13:13:37 <fb`>	we're wondering how tercaL's wget is deleting files
Mar 04 13:13:38 <hangint3n>	grrrrrrrrr
Mar 04 13:13:51 <hangint3n>	drm
Mar 04 13:13:54 <zanoh>	Are you guys pro or anti skub.
Mar 04 13:13:59 <AntonoiCarpio>	im pro drm
Mar 04 13:15:28 <fb`>	yeah - who needs hdmi 2.1 anyways?
Mar 04 13:15:47 <hangint3n>	as some who has intellectual property, im still not pro drm
Mar 04 13:15:53 <djph>	fb`: well, chances are someone kept "--delete-after
Mar 04 13:16:15 <zanoh>	I would only use proprietary software if I had no choice but to use it. Otherwise I'm happy without it.
Mar 04 13:16:24 <djph>	hangint3n: I had that once, then I put it on github and stopped caring :)
Mar 04 13:16:33 <fb`>	djph maybe someone played a trick on em: `ln -s /bin/rm wget`
Mar 04 13:16:33 <hangint3n>	ppl are always going to find a way around drm
Mar 04 13:16:50 <zanoh>	I wouldn't mind DRM so much if it didn't do stupid stuff like make you be online for SINGLE player mode.
Mar 04 13:17:19 <djph>	fb`: heh
Mar 04 13:17:22 <zanoh>	Besides, DRM used to be a lot more convoluted. Remember back in the 80s when you had to spin a spinner, put in a number from a keycode, or do sign language to just boot the game up?
Mar 04 13:17:36 <djph>	zanoh: that was fun though
Mar 04 13:17:38 <hangint3n>	lol
Mar 04 13:17:55 <djph>	(and it worked, and didn't fuck up the game when you got it wrong)
Mar 04 13:18:09 <AntonoiCarpio>	zanoh: i want that drm that windows has where if you attempt to screenshot or record an encrypted video, you get blackscreen instead
Mar 04 13:18:10 <zanoh>	djph, It was fun until you lost the manual OR your purchased game didn't have one.
Mar 04 13:18:48 <djph>	zanoh: I mean sure, that was problematic.  But it's not nearly as problematic as "lol you updated windows you pirate" that systems have these days.
Mar 04 13:18:50 <AntonoiCarpio>	that way i can play 4k on linux with my prime and netflix
Mar 04 13:19:09 <zanoh>	You had to be careful with SNES games back in the day. Earthbound for example, would literally wipe your save file at the final boss if it thinks it's a pirated copy.
Mar 04 13:19:25 <djph>	hehe, yep
Mar 04 13:19:44 <djph>	nothing is perfect, not by a longshot
Mar 04 13:19:52 <hangint3n>	true
Mar 04 13:21:01 <zanoh>	I still got a copy of GTA 5 lying around. I wonder if my other computer can handle it. Only one way to find out I guess.
Mar 04 13:21:34 *	Helenah peeps
Mar 04 13:22:12 <djph>	'sup Helenah
Mar 04 13:22:40 <zanoh>	No hype will beat the hype for brawl back in 2007/2008. People were going crazy who was confirmed next for brawl.
Mar 04 13:24:55 <hangint3n>	i wasnt gaming back then. only started gaming this year with bg3 & cs2
Mar 04 13:25:21 <zanoh>	"If counter-strike is so great, why isn't there a counter-strike 2?" Who's laughing now.
Mar 04 13:25:37 <hangint3n>	built my very first gaming rig
Mar 04 13:26:07 <hangint3n>	this year
Mar 04 13:26:13 <zanoh>	Fun fact: Before counter-strike, there was action quake 2. Both games are very similar to each other only AQ2 is more about being a hollywood action movie.
Mar 04 13:26:31 <hangint3n>	9h
Mar 04 13:26:35 <hangint3n>	oh
Mar 04 13:27:16 <zanoh>	Too bad bots in games like quake 1/2 tend to be glorified aimbots where they get inhuman accuracy.
Mar 04 13:28:17 <hangint3n>	im really really dont understand cheaters?
Mar 04 13:28:41 <hangint3n>	what do they get out of it
Mar 04 13:28:45 <zanoh>	No, I mean offline bots. You can play against.
Mar 04 13:28:53 <hangint3n>	oh
Mar 04 13:29:14 <zanoh>	Quake 1 and 2 let you through mods, play against AI driven bots similar to quake 3, but they were hit or miss.
Mar 04 13:29:33 <hangint3n>	got it
Mar 04 13:30:01 <Helenah>	djph: sup?
Mar 04 13:30:04 <zanoh>	This one particular bot, I think it was called gladiator, got the dev a job for epic games to make the unreal tournament bots.
Mar 04 13:31:03 <hangint3n>	cool
Mar 04 13:31:20 <hangint3n>	ive not yet play online
Mar 04 13:31:21 <zanoh>	Mods are always cool how someone with enough time on their hands can pull off.
Mar 04 13:32:16 <hangint3n>	im still in the noob stage figuring out the bssics of game play
Mar 04 13:32:42 <zanoh>	What genres do you like to play right now?
Mar 04 13:33:29 <Artfaith>	Those where you think.
Mar 04 13:34:16 <hangint3n>	i only have played 3 games so far so, bg3, cs2, automoblist
Mar 04 13:34:57 <hangint3n>	i really like them all. but bg3 is by far my fav
Mar 04 13:35:54 <hangint3n>	im getting to become someone of an expert in dying lol
Mar 04 13:36:28 <Artfaith>	May I ask what is your age range? 10-20, 20-30, 30-40..?
Mar 04 13:36:38 <zanoh>	I bet you'll love I wanna be the guy.
Mar 04 13:36:46 <hangint3n>	sure
Mar 04 13:36:56 <hangint3n>	50-70
Mar 04 13:37:09 <zanoh>	For realsies?
Mar 04 13:37:14 <hangint3n>	yup
Mar 04 13:37:34 <Artfaith>	Well, in such case I will recommend you Zachtronics, hangint3n. This is what I love.
Mar 04 13:37:40 <wigums>	im between 23 and potato
Mar 04 13:38:31 <hangint3n>	age is just a number, a box....
Mar 04 13:38:59 <Artfaith>	I would not say so. It's an expectation of an experience.
Mar 04 13:39:53 <hangint3n>	it is awesome to know i used the first bbs, first internet, firs irc
Mar 04 13:39:56 <djph>	wigums: you're a 23 year old potato?
Mar 04 13:40:40 <Artfaith>	If you're above 30, your black and white have organized so that you should be aware of the blur part, and know that you decide in gray.
Mar 04 13:40:41 <zanoh>	Always cool to meet literal boomers who have far more experience with OG unix than I ever will. :D
Mar 04 13:41:45 <wigums>	meh baby boomers were born in 40s-50s... what you guys call a "boomer" is a deragatory term for anyone older than you
Mar 04 13:42:21 <zanoh>	hangint3n may very well be withint the literal age to be a baby boomer. Hence why I said literal.
Mar 04 13:42:31 <Artfaith>	"canada.masto.host" I see.
Mar 04 13:42:49 <hangint3n>	zanoh, thanks, it just consider myself a causal user that has the pleasure to experience a lot of cool tech
Mar 04 13:43:20 <zanoh>	I do however dislike the "30 year old boomer" meme that has overtaken the internet by storm. wigums.
Mar 04 13:43:40 <Artfaith>	hangint3n, so, have you checked out Zachtronics?
Mar 04 13:43:41 <Artfaith>	For example, https://www.zachtronics.com/molek-syntez/
Mar 04 13:44:22 <djph>	30 year olds are boomers now? o_O
Mar 04 13:44:56 <dubiago>	it's a meme...since when did they make any rational sense?
Mar 04 13:44:59 <louipc>	yes
Mar 04 13:45:02 <Artfaith>	Some minimal ASM programming: https://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/ , some more puzzles: https://www.zachtronics.com/last-call-bbs/
Mar 04 13:45:08 <hangint3n>	Artfaith, thats an interesting game concept
Mar 04 13:45:32 <Artfaith>	Opus Magnum is freaking marvelous, too, well... every single title of the developer...
Mar 04 13:45:40 <zanoh>	You should also check out TIS-100 if you like assembly programming.
Mar 04 13:45:45 <Artfaith>	^^^
Mar 04 13:46:54 <hangint3n>	dont let tags bother you, they dont define you, your daily actions define you.  ppl can say a lot of non-sense.
Mar 04 13:47:14 <Artfaith>	hangint3n, not surprised. The developer is the one who implemented the Minecraft concept the first with Infiniminer, the one Notch started from with his marsterpiece. There's some history, and it is all purely genius...
Mar 04 13:48:15 <hangint3n>	ill have to spend sometime looking into this
Mar 04 13:48:28 <tercaL>	Is there any way to record the outputs of top/htop for half hour, into a file for later review?
Mar 04 13:48:35 <tercaL>	That'd help me a lot
Mar 04 13:48:46 <hangint3n>	but im at work right now so it will have to wait
Mar 04 13:48:50 <Artfaith>	They also act responsibly. I once wrote to their support that Open Magnum did not launch on OpenGL 3 due to some extension missing, and they responded in person to the Email asking for more details. It got solved.
Mar 04 13:49:30 <Artfaith>	tercaL, sure thing.
Mar 04 13:49:35 <hangint3n>	cool, i love that
Mar 04 13:49:43 <aurevoir>	:)
Mar 04 13:49:49 <Artfaith>	tercaL, https://asciinema.org/
Mar 04 13:50:20 <Artfaith>	Though, I would suggest an alternative like storing data in timed JSON file for example.
Mar 04 13:50:28 <Artfaith>	Raw data without TUI/colors.
Mar 04 13:50:33 <livingbeef>	you might want to record ps or dstat instead
Mar 04 13:50:38 <Artfaith>	^
Mar 04 13:51:11 <Artfaith>	In case you want more colors, you may find `btop` interesting, too: https://github.com/aristocratos/btop
Mar 04 13:51:59 <hangint3n>	love btop
Mar 04 13:53:00 <tercaL>	would this do as well?: top -b > test.txt
Mar 04 13:54:48 <nuxli>	hello?
Mar 04 13:55:16 <hangint3n>	hello
Mar 04 13:55:37 <dubiago>	hello?!?!]
Mar 04 13:56:49 <Guts71>	Hello linux community !!!
Mar 04 13:57:03 <hangint3n>	o/
Mar 04 14:03:28 <ananke>	tercaL: so, you don't even know if it's 'wget process' and you're just guessing?
Mar 04 14:05:57 <godSend23>	hey all
Mar 04 14:07:22 <luna_>	hey
Mar 04 14:07:44 <godSend23>	what's up
Mar 04 14:08:00 <luna_>	just watching DLN
Mar 04 14:08:44 <hangint3n>	o/
Mar 04 14:08:53 <godSend23>	what's that
Mar 04 14:12:18 <luna_>	godSend23: Destination Linux a Linux video podcast about KDE 6 this week, but now watching Linux Experiments KDE 6 video
Mar 04 14:12:27 <godSend23>	ohhhh
Mar 04 14:12:41 <godSend23>	https://9to5linux.com/kde-plasma-6-desktop-environment-officially-released-this-is-whats-new
Mar 04 14:13:08 <luna_>	yep since mid last week, and the first minor release on Wednsday
Mar 04 14:13:14 <Guest85>	I set a password and forgot it. What should I do now?
Mar 04 14:14:27 <MacGyver>	GuestM: Do you recall the password for the root account?
Mar 04 14:15:08 <dubiago>	If not, are you part of the sudo group?
Mar 04 14:15:28 <GuestM>	I didn't create a Root account
Mar 04 14:15:29 <fb`>	GuestM linux user account? boot into recovery os to edit shadow file
Mar 04 14:15:41 <MacGyver>	Don't edit the shadow file by hand.
Mar 04 14:16:20 <MacGyver>	If you have permissions to edit the shadow file, you can chroot and run passwd.
Mar 04 14:16:44 <GuestM>	how to do this?
Mar 04 14:16:47 <MacGyver>	(Or do edit the shadow file by hand, but if you break it, you get to keep both pieces)
Mar 04 14:16:56 <ioria>	GuestM, you  boot  in recovery Mode from grub and add a new user ?
Mar 04 14:17:26 <godSend23>	what's all the hoollabaloo about this luna_ ?
Mar 04 14:17:31 <ioria>	GuestM, and add new user to sudo
Mar 04 14:17:34 <tercaL>	ananke: Wordpress Activity Log Viewer reports: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/fOcgAQyO/raw
Mar 04 14:17:36 <godSend23>	is it a gamechanger?
Mar 04 14:17:36 <luna_>	godSend23: hm?
Mar 04 14:17:48 <tercaL>	In the moment of the deletion.. Obviously, some weird things with wget..
Mar 04 14:17:49 <GuestM>	No, it doesn’t offer me this when loading
Mar 04 14:18:10 <ioria>	GuestM, Grub -> Advanced Options
Mar 04 14:18:38 <GuestM>	how to launch a terminal with admin rights at startup?
Mar 04 14:18:54 <MacGyver>	GuestM: Which distribution are you on?
Mar 04 14:18:55 <luna_>	if you mean KDE 6 no idea as i mostly use Niri and GNOME only played with it for a bit for like 2,5 days
Mar 04 14:19:00 <GuestM>	Fedora
Mar 04 14:19:06 <ananke>	tercaL: is that your IP or your client? if not, this has nothing to do with wget nor linux, rather your compromised wordpress
Mar 04 14:19:18 <tercaL>	IP of my server
Mar 04 14:19:36 <luna_>	and being sick and pretty busy i have not really had any time to click around that much
Mar 04 14:20:17 <fb`>	tercaL that looks like wget may be calling a rest api to delete files?
Mar 04 14:20:25 <fb`>	seems sketchy
Mar 04 14:20:43 <jadenlian>	GuestM: boot from a USB using a linux distro(ubuntu) and use the option to test the os before installing and you can access the files on the hard-drive and modify them
Mar 04 14:20:58 <tercaL>	fb`: Much likely, any idea I might take a look?
Mar 04 14:21:10 <ananke>	tercaL: it's certainly still wordpress related, because said wget has permissions to access it
Mar 04 14:21:30 <godSend23>	oh ok
Mar 04 14:22:08 <ananke>	tercaL: you can check your cron jobs, start with inspecting contents of /var/spool/cron/tabs . see what files there are, and what they contain
Mar 04 14:22:19 <GuestM>	And what i may after&
Mar 04 14:22:53 <ananke>	tercaL: also, inspect your system/wordpress/etc logs for events around the time this started to happen
Mar 04 14:23:56 <tercaL>	ananke: Actually a "managed" (horribly) VPS by Cloudways.. Cannot access those files in SSH, got a limited user rights.
Mar 04 14:24:39 <fb`>	tercaL do you own the server? something higher level may have a policy that auto-deletes files it doesn't like
Mar 04 14:24:50 <fb`>	there you go
Mar 04 14:25:11 <ananke>	tercaL: so ask your provider. this is nothing we can assist you with
Mar 04 14:25:27 <GuestM>	 ~jadenlian@user/jadenlian what may i do with usb?
Mar 04 14:27:57 <jadenlian>	GuestM: i what i would do is eather modify the /etc/passwd file and create a new user with now password  :)
Mar 04 14:28:22 <jadenlian>	or delele the password for your user
Mar 04 14:28:58 <GuestM>	how to make this?
Mar 04 14:29:21 <fb`>	GuestM do you have a working user you can login as?
Mar 04 14:30:10 <GuestM>	No
Mar 04 14:31:06 <fb`>	does the system boot up ok and does it run a ssh server?
Mar 04 14:31:28 <jadenlian>	GuestM: username::1000:1000:username,,,:/home/username:/bin/bash    add this line to the file
Mar 04 14:31:52 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 04 14:31:53 *	litharge removes ban on $a:Batzy$##fix_your_connection
Mar 04 14:31:53 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 04 14:32:54 <jadenlian>	Guest3661: change username for a username you want  and there will be no passwd for this user so you can log in with no problem
Mar 04 14:33:16 <ananke>	uhmm, /etc/passwd entry without corresponding /etc/shadow entry is not going to work
Mar 04 14:34:03 <ananke>	gotta scroll up, but any advice to insert random stuff into /etc/passwd is usually an ill one at best
Mar 04 14:34:58 <jadenlian>	it will  since  by not adding the X on the second colon does not reference to a password and it will work  ive done it before
Mar 04 14:34:59 <ananke>	yeah. that's a bad idea. use 'adduser' instead
Mar 04 14:36:03 <jadenlian>	he cant log in to the system and he will access the file through using a usb with a linux distro
Mar 04 14:36:38 <MacGyver>	So instruct them to chroot and just run passwd.
Mar 04 14:36:59 <MacGyver>	I don't run Fedora myself so I can't handhold the process.
Mar 04 14:37:16 <ananke>	for starters, changing root password would be easier/safer than adding random junk to /etc/passwd (which doesn't even create required group)
Mar 04 14:38:30 <ananke>	bah, they're not even here
Mar 04 14:39:23 <hangint3n>	dont hate that.... lol
Mar 04 14:50:47 <[twisti]>	how can i use journald to filter to a user service ? the unit shows up like `user@1012.service/foo-bar.service`, but nothing i supplied to `journalctl -u` seems to be able to filter to that, instead it mangles the name in various ways
Mar 04 14:50:49 <pentanol>	someone can help in google?
Mar 04 14:52:29 <peac>	[twisti] this seems to be a user service, you need to pass in --user
Mar 04 14:54:56 <[twisti]>	peac: that doesnt really make sense to me; unfiltered, they show up in the systems journal, and the user has no access to journald, nor do i want to give it to him
Mar 04 14:55:11 <peac>	the canonical way to reset user password in linux is to edit the grub line at boot to insert init=/bin/bash and use passwd from there
Mar 04 14:56:32 <peac>	[twisti] can you confirm this service is from that user's .config/systemd/system/foo-bar.service ?
Mar 04 14:56:40 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Mar 04 14:57:25 <[twisti]>	peac: i can, and it also shows up as `user@1012.service/foo-bar.service` when i run journalctl with `--output with-unit`
Mar 04 14:58:16 <[twisti]>	wait, actually, its from `.config/systemd/user/foo-bar.service`
Mar 04 14:58:23 <peac>	[twisti] try --user-unit as root
Mar 04 14:58:52 <[twisti]>	tried that with about a dozen variations of the listed unit name, same results or no results at all
Mar 04 14:59:16 <peac>	can you post an extract of log entries that show the unit's logs ?
Mar 04 14:59:36 <peac>	foo-bar should be sufficient to filter the logs
Mar 04 14:59:51 <[twisti]>	sure: `Wed 2024-02-21 18:28:55 CET hostname user@1012.service/foo-bar.service[3387594]: ------------------- Bla ------------------------------------------------------`
Mar 04 14:59:59 <peac>	use privatebin please
Mar 04 15:00:05 <[twisti]>	for a single line ?
Mar 04 15:00:21 <peac>	no my bad i thought it was going to be multiline
Mar 04 15:00:31 <louipc>	:)
Mar 04 15:00:48 <louipc>	whats the line threshhold
Mar 04 15:00:53 <louipc>	i'd say more than 3 line
Mar 04 15:01:16 <peac>	usually anything that reads poorly in a chat
Mar 04 15:01:24 <[twisti]>	no variation of journalctl calls i have attempted have resulted in that line being displayed, i either get an error that the unit name it printed out itself is invalid, or 'no entries'
Mar 04 15:01:51 <peac>	1012 is the uid ?
Mar 04 15:01:57 <[twisti]>	correct
Mar 04 15:02:14 <peac>	never seen this format afair
Mar 04 15:02:20 <peac>	can you paste the service ?

Mar 04 15:08:17 <elektrinis>	hi
Mar 04 15:08:18 <elektrinis>	can I add PCIe-USB hub on a running machine?
Mar 04 15:08:44 <djph>	I wouldn't.
Mar 04 15:08:56 <MacGyver>	In *theory*, yes. In practice, I wouldn't risk it.
Mar 04 15:08:57 <elektrinis>	well I attached it, but nothing
Mar 04 15:08:58 <Artfaith>	This depends on the BIOS/motherboard. I don't think so. PCIe are being probed on BIOS boot I believe.
Mar 04 15:09:28 <Artfaith>	So, the BIOS won't notice the difference, and hence, the OS>
Mar 04 15:10:01 <MacGyver>	Artfaith: What the BIOS does is irrelevant, Linux enumerates the bus on its own.
Mar 04 15:10:07 <MacGyver>	You can trigger a rescan yourself.
Mar 04 15:10:31 <MacGyver>	Though I'd have to look up how to do it again exactly, it's been too long.
Mar 04 15:11:04 <Artfaith>	Though, indeed I see the bus probe function: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/pci/probe.c#L3070
Mar 04 15:11:10 <MacGyver>	`echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan` should do it.
Mar 04 15:11:22 <elektrinis>	hm
Mar 04 15:11:29 <[twisti]>	it seems like filtering journalctl to a user service is outright not possible
Mar 04 15:11:38 <[twisti]>	even chatgpt goes in circles
Mar 04 15:11:49 <Artfaith>	...
Mar 04 15:11:59 <Artfaith>	Why don't just drop it from your life, [twisti]?
Mar 04 15:12:05 <[twisti]>	drop what ?
Mar 04 15:12:26 <MacGyver>	I do need to emphasize I have no idea whether rescanning the PCI bus is a *safe* operation, in that e.g. it guarantees hardware's addresses don't change around and/or if it's safe if not all hardware has proper hotplug support.
Mar 04 15:12:27 <Artfaith>	Your nonsense LLM. We have us here, the knowledge, the experience.
Mar 04 15:13:26 <[twisti]>	Artfaith: i have asked here as well, to no avail
Mar 04 15:13:37 <Artfaith>	What did you ask?
Mar 04 15:13:51 <[twisti]>	how to filter journalctl to my user service
Mar 04 15:14:08 <Artfaith>	Where is the user service located?
Mar 04 15:14:31 <elektrinis>	shredding 5x USB 5TB HDDs at once
Mar 04 15:14:35 <elektrinis>	WiFi is dead
Mar 04 15:14:46 <elektrinis>	(due to USB3 interference)
Mar 04 15:14:48 <[twisti]>	`/home/user/.config/systemd/user/foo-bar.service`
Mar 04 15:14:55 <MacGyver>	elektrinis: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/208796 has several details relevant to you.
Mar 04 15:14:55 <Artfaith>	I see `journalctl` supports option `--unit`.
Mar 04 15:15:02 <Artfaith>	Have you tried the option, [twisti]?
Mar 04 15:15:24 <peac>	Artfaith the problem was described just a few lines earlier already
Mar 04 15:15:40 <[twisti]>	Artfaith: i have tried and have discussed the problem here over the past half hour, yes
Mar 04 15:16:14 <[twisti]>	which is how i arrived at my conclusion that it isnt possible
Mar 04 15:16:18 <Artfaith>	peac, I don't see the option suggested/used.
Mar 04 15:16:27 <peac>	[twisti] i can reproduce your issue, i get the logs when running from the user account but not from root
Mar 04 15:17:15 <[twisti]>	Artfaith: it was literally the very first thing i said
Mar 04 15:17:49 <[twisti]>	peac: i suppose its off to grep for me, which is honestly disappointing, i wouldnt have thought that systemd user services were such an exotic use case
Mar 04 15:18:06 <Artfaith>	I see this: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/src/shared/logs-show.c#L1612
Mar 04 15:18:08 <peac>	the canonical way to do this is to use podman's log-driver instead
Mar 04 15:18:29 <Artfaith>	Which is https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/b12ec739a921e800d5be0e66ddfc8f6f562490d4/src/journal/journalctl.c#L1567
Mar 04 15:19:29 <Artfaith>	This one uses the pattern coming from `--unit`: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/b12ec739a921e800d5be0e66ddfc8f6f562490d4/src/journal/journalctl.c#L1413
Mar 04 15:19:47 <Artfaith>	So, indeed, the UID is also there, prior the pattern.
Mar 04 15:20:09 <Artfaith>	peac, I would say s/podman/container
Mar 04 15:20:18 <peac>	they're using podman
Mar 04 15:20:23 <Artfaith>	Oh. I see.
Mar 04 15:22:47 <ariblessedvegan>	Hey, after years, switched to fedora and am more than happy.
Mar 04 15:23:04 <peac>	ariblessedvegan from what ?
Mar 04 15:23:11 <ariblessedvegan>	deb.
Mar 04 15:23:32 <Artfaith>	What in Debian made you unhappy if I may ask?
Mar 04 15:23:59 <ananke>	maybe they're just happier in fedora.
Mar 04 15:24:07 <ariblessedvegan>	not debian itself but was on ubuntu. not being a community-supported distro, and apt were the reasons.
Mar 04 15:25:13 <djph>	Ubuntu isn't "community supported" ?
Mar 04 15:25:17 <[twisti]>	Artfaith: that looks right, but it just doesnt actually work
Mar 04 15:26:10 <Artfaith>	Ubuntu has the most active Community out there I believe.
Mar 04 15:26:33 <ariblessedvegan>	Community-developed.
Mar 04 15:26:46 <Artfaith>	What do you mean by developing?
Mar 04 15:26:59 <Artfaith>	For example?
Mar 04 15:27:38 <Artfaith>	[twisti], I would strace it then, to see what and how it happens.
Mar 04 15:27:54 <Artfaith>	`strace -- journalctl --unit...`
Mar 04 15:28:32 <peac>	[twisti] you can get more info with SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug SYTEMD_LOG_TARGET=console journalctl <...>
Mar 04 15:28:46 <peac>	it shows the filtering rules
Mar 04 15:29:03 <peac>	maybe using some env variables prepended correctly will help
Mar 04 15:33:17 <peac>	if you need a simpler test https://privatebin.net/?87654535d8618ada#Fgp8afi7J4Fi55edjKDvaphjJfmDh7ifED1a1B7BEhvW

Mar 04 16:28:12 <atreo>	people i am having trouble setting up a swapfile    here is my steps https://paste.debian.net/1309422/   i keep getting insecure permissions   how do i overcome this issue?
Mar 04 16:29:05 <peac>	did you chmod 600
Mar 04 16:29:21 <peac>	you did, my bad
Mar 04 16:29:36 <billings>	iirc the directory ownership needs to be correct too
Mar 04 16:29:48 <peac>	it did not work though, it sees 666
Mar 04 16:30:14 <atreo>	peac: yes
Mar 04 16:30:14 <rascul>	did chmod give an error?
Mar 04 16:30:21 <atreo>	chmod did not give an error
Mar 04 16:30:26 <peac>	ls -la
Mar 04 16:30:32 <rascul>	what are the permissions on the directory?
Mar 04 16:30:48 <ananke>	stat ./swapfile, is it by any chance on a non-unix filesystem?
Mar 04 16:31:14 <atreo>	peac:     drwxrwxrwx     but the swap has  -rw-rw-rw-
Mar 04 16:31:21 <peac>	thats 666
Mar 04 16:31:23 <peac>	not 600
Mar 04 16:31:45 <atreo>	peac: hmmm how do i change it?    because i already tried chmod 600 ./swapfile
Mar 04 16:31:57 <peac>	are you root when doing this ?
Mar 04 16:32:03 <atreo>	yes
Mar 04 16:32:03 <ananke>	atreo: what filesystem is /workspace on?
Mar 04 16:32:29 <oerheks>	why not the easy way; sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
Mar 04 16:32:31 <atreo>	ananke: not sure   how do i check?   i should be on linux
Mar 04 16:32:38 <ananke>	atreo: findmnt /workspace
Mar 04 16:32:51 <ananke>	oerheks: that doesn't solve the problem at hand
Mar 04 16:33:07 <atreo>	ananke: /workspace mfs#euro.runpod.net:9421[/podvolumes/279psz4y9p69/vkvl2gun50gfkn] fuse   rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,allow_other
Mar 04 16:33:21 <ananke>	atreo: that's why. you're on a fuse filesystem
Mar 04 16:33:26 <atreo>	oh
Mar 04 16:33:32 <pell_>	atreo: are you running some of those as root or sudo but some not as root or sudo?
Mar 04 16:33:40 <pell_>	or that
Mar 04 16:33:59 <peac>	the filesystem is the issue as ananke noticed
Mar 04 16:34:27 <atreo>	peac: i guess,   i am at a VPS to use a GPU   but i am trying to increase me swap because i application keeps crashing
Mar 04 16:34:51 <ananke>	atreo: check with your VPS provider on best practice for that.
Mar 04 16:34:51 <atreo>	peac: is there a way around the different filessytem and still establish a swap?
Mar 04 16:35:21 <peac>	you'll need a plain ext4 filesystem
Mar 04 16:35:47 <ananke>	not ext4 specifically, but you certainly won't be able to do it with your current one
Mar 04 16:36:01 <livingbeef>	Create a .img file, mount it on loopback, create ext4 fs on it, mount the ext4 fs and create swapfile on it
Mar 04 16:36:11 <ananke>	livingbeef: not going to work, afaik
Mar 04 16:36:18 <pell_>	yeah, I never format swap as ext4
Mar 04 16:36:27 <ananke>	pell_: that wasn't even suggested
Mar 04 16:37:09 <livingbeef>	I'm pretty sure it would be substantially slower even if it worked
Mar 04 16:37:15 <atreo>	no problem   thanks guys
Mar 04 16:37:25 <pell_>	no, i mean swap does not need to be ext4
Mar 04 16:37:36 <ananke>	livingbeef: try it. I'm betting a shiny nickel it won't.
Mar 04 16:37:41 <rascul>	said to create swapfile on ext4 not as ext4
Mar 04 16:38:15 <livingbeef>	pell_: that's not what I suggested
Mar 04 16:38:37 <ananke>	pell_: nobody said anything about 'swap' 'need to be ext4', unless you're suggesting that swap _file_ does not need to be _on ext4'
Mar 04 16:39:02 <pell_>	i'm agreeing with ananke's earlier
Mar 04 16:41:12 <CrtxReavr>	It's best to use a swap partition, vs. a swap file, so you can eliminate filesystem code from the swapping overhead.
Mar 04 16:41:17 <billings>	it certainly won't work on a FUSE filesystem
Mar 04 16:41:32 <rascul>	linus doesn't like swap files
Mar 04 16:41:40 <MacGyver>	CrtxReavr: There is no filesystem code in swapping overhead.
Mar 04 16:41:48 <MacGyver>	Swapfiles get a direct mapping.
Mar 04 16:41:49 <CrtxReavr>	Even Windows doesn't really use a swapfile.
Mar 04 16:42:43 <CrtxReavr>	10:36 < livingbeef> Create a .img file, mount it on loopback, create ext4 fs on it, mount the ext4 fs and create swapfile on it
Mar 04 16:42:55 <rascul>	"swapfiles tend to be slower and have various other complexity issues"    https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2103.0/06524.html
Mar 04 16:43:15 <rascul>	linus doesn't get to tell me how to swap though, i still use swap files
Mar 04 16:43:21 <de-facto>	when compiling cpp, there are the __TIME__ and __DATE__ macros, how do i set their values? it seems they are stuck on some date in the past
Mar 04 16:43:31 <de-facto>	or is that derived from file modification or such?
Mar 04 16:43:34 <MacGyver>	Okay *that* jenga tower probably will have overhead, but that's because of the .img on loopback, not because of filesystem code.
Mar 04 16:43:37 <dragonmaster>	more time has been consumed discussing the relative performance than would be saved by using a partition over a file
Mar 04 16:44:02 <CrtxReavr>	I used to have to build linux images with swapfiles for $reasons.  I certainly never encounted anything that lead me to believe there wasn't filesystem or file calls involved in utilizing it.
Mar 04 16:44:19 <rascul>	filesystems have to support swap files, that's all i know
Mar 04 16:44:20 <CrtxReavr>	Granted. . . this was quite some time ago.
Mar 04 16:44:33 <rascul>	and swap files can't be sparse
Mar 04 16:44:35 <rascul>	i know two things
Mar 04 16:44:38 <MacGyver>	https://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0507.0/1690.html was also quite some time ago.
Mar 04 16:45:00 <MacGyver>	"The kernel generates a map of swap offset -> disk blocks at swapon time and from then on uses that map to perform swap I/O directly against the underlying disk queue, bypassing all caching, metadata and filesystem code."
Mar 04 16:45:20 <MacGyver>	Iirc this was *the* reason btrfs didn't support swap files for the longest time.
Mar 04 16:46:28 <ayecee>	yeah. because of cow, it couldn't provide such a mapping.
Mar 04 16:46:30 <MacGyver>	This is also the issue that mail from Linus is actually about.
Mar 04 16:46:34 <ayecee>	swapfiles have to be nocow.
Mar 04 16:46:35 <MacGyver>	"the offset of the start of the swap file was lost."
Mar 04 16:46:36 <rascul>	i like cows
Mar 04 16:46:47 <MacGyver>	So you get swap writes to random *other* disk blocks.
Mar 04 16:46:47 <rascul>	they're delicious
Mar 04 16:47:08 <ayecee>	parts of them anyway
Mar 04 16:47:26 <rascul>	the meaty parts
Mar 04 16:47:30 <ayecee>	plus you can make a new one by writing over where the old one was
Mar 04 16:47:49 <CrtxReavr>	A supposed mailing list mirrror, hosted at indiana.edu for a no-longer existing mailing list.
Mar 04 16:48:21 <rascul>	lkml doesn't exist anymore?
Mar 04 16:48:41 <wiz>	"The kernel generates a map of swap offset -> disk blocks at swapon time and from then on uses that map to perform swap I/O directly against the underlying disk queue, bypassing all caching, metadata and filesystem code." -> i didn't get it.
Mar 04 16:48:49 <MacGyver>	CrtxReavr: Okay, here's the same mail on lkml.org: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/7/326
Mar 04 16:49:51 <CrtxReavr>	Well, tux.org seems. . . broken - I was reading the error message too quickly.
Mar 04 16:50:45 <rascul>	here it is on kernel.org   https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20050707145944.3ad8a1ab.akpm@osdl.org/
Mar 04 16:51:07 <MacGyver>	wiz: Tl;dr: swap files behave like swap partitions embedded inside the filesystem, so there's no filesystem overhead.
Mar 04 16:51:25 <wiz>	no need for swap partition.
Mar 04 16:51:40 <CrtxReavr>	I guess the NOTES section of swapon(8) backs up what you're saying.
Mar 04 16:52:21 <livingbeef>	ananke: you owe me a shiny nickel
Mar 04 16:52:36 <ayecee>	or a grubby dime
Mar 04 16:53:19 <MacGyver>	rascul: So I'm gonna go [citation needed] on Linus' claim that swapfiles tend to be slower, because at face value they certainly *shouldn't* be.
Mar 04 16:53:37 <MacGyver>	He's probably thinking of some particular setup but I'd *really* like to see his thoughts on that.
Mar 04 16:53:46 <rascul>	linus doesn't cite, either appeal to authority or don't
Mar 04 16:54:26 <MacGyver>	That being said, I prefer swap partitions on top of LVM.
Mar 04 16:54:27 <ayecee>	back then i don't think direct mapping like that was a thing.
Mar 04 16:54:44 <billings>	btrfs even has a special command for creating swap files on a btrfs filesystem
Mar 04 16:55:01 <billings>	https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Swapfile.html
Mar 04 16:55:02 <MacGyver>	ayecee: The mail I cited was from 2005. It's been in Linux since 2.6. Linus's mail is 2021.
Mar 04 16:55:28 <xx>	did y'all check your kernel's taint recently? For some reason mine was non-zero due to a kernel warning being issued but so long ago that it's not in the logs
Mar 04 16:55:31 <xx>	cat /proc/sys/kernel/tainted
Mar 04 16:55:37 <MacGyver>	Maybe something happened inbetween where it actually *does* take into account filesystem specifics now but the very bug he's referring to implies it *doesn't*.
Mar 04 16:55:41 <ayecee>	MacGyver: i haven't been following the links. i'll take your word for it that the timeline checks out.
Mar 04 16:56:19 <rascul>	0 taint here
Mar 04 16:56:33 <billings>	xx: https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/tainted-kernels.html
Mar 04 16:56:49 <xx>	yes, that's the link to help decode the meaning
Mar 04 16:57:01 <xx>	minde was 512
Mar 04 16:57:04 <xx>	*mine
Mar 04 16:57:13 <ayecee>	i do find mentions that, historically, swapfiles performance was affected by fileystem overhead. i don't know when that changed.
Mar 04 16:57:31 <ayecee>	but i do realize that it changed.
Mar 04 16:58:47 <livingbeef>	Depends on the setup too. I would not be at all surprised if direct mapping from fs -> file.img -> loopdev -> fs -> swapfile did not in fact work
Mar 04 16:59:01 <ayecee>	i don't see why not
Mar 04 16:59:26 <MacGyver>	livingbeef: Yeah that's why I said, *that* jenga tower *may* end up with overhead due to the .img-via-loopdev.
Mar 04 16:59:30 <ayecee>	is this just, it looks complicated, and complicated things sometimes don't work?
Mar 04 16:59:35 <MacGyver>	But that's not really a common setup, right.
Mar 04 16:59:47 <xx>	why would filesystem overhead matter for swapfiles? It writes directly to the allocated bits on the drive
Mar 04 16:59:59 <ayecee>	xx: it didn't always. it does now.
Mar 04 17:00:01 <MacGyver>	xx: That is *precisely* the point of contention.
Mar 04 17:00:24 <xx>	if you mean previously, during swap1 implementation, that's a long time ago
Mar 04 17:00:25 <MacGyver>	xx: Re: tainting, don't you have persistent logging?
Mar 04 17:00:37 <ayecee>	xx: i think you and me are jumping into a conversation without context.
Mar 04 17:00:41 <xx>	MacGyver: hmm, good point, maybe I do
Mar 04 17:01:16 <livingbeef>	xx: not necessarily when it goes through several different drivers; if one of them doesn't support direct mapping, it won't work
Mar 04 17:01:45 <xx>	if it doesn't support direct mapping, kernel won't even permit the file to be used as a swapfile
Mar 04 17:02:13 <xx>	same with having holes
Mar 04 17:04:38 <livingbeef>	if you're directly mapping onto /dev/loop0, the kernel may not be aware that the direct mapping is an illusion
Mar 04 17:04:40 <MacGyver>	xx: It may support direct mapping to the underlying block device -- which, being a loopback device, ends up having overhead.
Mar 04 17:05:05 <MacGyver>	There's no reason it *couldn't* be made aware, but whether that's actually implemented is a separate matter altogether.
Mar 04 17:05:13 <ayecee>	livingbeef: why's that?
Mar 04 17:05:53 <ayecee>	does the loop driver lie about direct mapping support or something?
Mar 04 17:06:48 <livingbeef>	loop isn't a fs, so that might not even be something the kernel asks for
Mar 04 17:06:55 <ayecee>	it is
Mar 04 17:07:00 <ayecee>	something the kernel asks for
Mar 04 17:07:04 <livingbeef>	no it's not, it's a block device
Mar 04 17:07:13 <livingbeef>	or so the kernel thinks
Mar 04 17:08:46 <ayecee>	i see the reasoning. i think that that wouldn't be an obstacle, that direct mapping isn't something that stops at the filesystem layer, but i don't have a way to verify that at the moment.
Mar 04 17:09:54 <ayecee>	hmm. but now that i think about it, encrypted swap wouldn't work if that were the case.
Mar 04 17:10:54 <ayecee>	the swap data must be written to a "virtual" block, which does not directly map to a physical block.
Mar 04 17:12:44 <ayecee>	welp, time to reboot.
Mar 04 17:14:26 <livingbeef>	At least now I know that if I run out of disk space, I can use swap-over-sshfs
Mar 04 17:14:53 <billings>	it probably would be counter-productive
Mar 04 17:14:53 <kfrench>	What could possibly go wrong?
Mar 04 17:15:02 <billings>	sshfs doesn't have byte-range locking
Mar 04 17:15:08 <billings>	it's basically glorified sftp
Mar 04 17:15:32 <ayecee>	so you're saying there's a chance
Mar 04 17:15:33 <billings>	so, most of the support for normal UNIX filesystem access is through client side buffers
Mar 04 17:15:41 <billings>	I really doubt it'd work
Mar 04 17:16:55 <ayecee>	i doubt it less than i did a few minutes ago.
Mar 04 17:17:09 <billings>	I had a researcher try to use sshfs for MPI-IO and it failed miserably
Mar 04 17:17:14 <MacGyver>	`swapon`'s manpage literally says that swap over NFS *may* not work.
Mar 04 17:17:15 <livingbeef>	it might, but the swap might use itself for swapping itself
Mar 04 17:17:32 <MacGyver>	Considering that phrasing, I wouldn't be surprised if swap-over-sshfs *did* work.
Mar 04 17:18:00 <MacGyver>	But I'm guessing that NFS's support for byte-range-locking is what *may* make it work?
Mar 04 17:18:10 <billings>	NFS supports more advanced features than FUS
Mar 04 17:18:11 <billings>	FUSE
Mar 04 17:18:34 <MacGyver>	I read that and basically thought "Okay this implies that people seriously consider running swap over a network and *why*?"
Mar 04 17:18:57 <livingbeef>	people seriously consider running swap on a HDD
Mar 04 17:18:58 <ayecee>	i'd think it'd be more around nfs's block-oriented nature, while sshfs works more with whole files
Mar 04 17:19:06 <billings>	right
Mar 04 17:19:21 <livingbeef>	NFS on SSD over NFS is much better than that
Mar 04 17:19:24 <dubiago>	The only thing I run on an HDD is a NAS
Mar 04 17:19:27 <livingbeef>	*swap on
Mar 04 17:20:16 <ayecee>	livingbeef: not so crazy as you might think. swap contains the least used pages of memory.
Mar 04 17:20:40 <ayecee>	it's not normally a high traffic item, unless your working set is larger than your physical memory.
Mar 04 17:21:11 <ayecee>	which was more often the case back in the day.
Mar 04 17:22:01 <livingbeef>	Can still happen with stuff like qtwebengine
Mar 04 17:23:10 <ayecee>	heh
Mar 04 17:23:11 <livingbeef>	that can eat 16G if you give it enough j
Mar 04 17:23:36 <ayecee>	not all of that is regularly touched though.
Mar 04 17:23:55 <ayecee>	the working set would be composed from the parts that get touched regularly.
Mar 04 17:24:17 <livingbeef>	if you're compiling, all of the parts are pretty active
Mar 04 17:25:10 <livingbeef>	of course you can just fix that by make -j4, or the like
Mar 04 17:26:47 <ayecee>	makes sense
Mar 04 17:27:57 <MacGyver>	livingbeef: I understand that performance of the network, especially nowadays, will likely be much better than spinning rust.
Mar 04 17:28:05 <MacGyver>	livingbeef: My problem with it is that the network is...
Mar 04 17:28:15 <MacGyver>	livingbeef: Not as stable as a SATA cable.
Mar 04 17:28:22 <ayecee>	i'm not familiar with qtwebengine. i thought it might be a large long-running process. a big unlimited parallel make would be different.
Mar 04 17:28:29 <MacGyver>	What happens if the page needs to be paged in while your network is down?.
Mar 04 17:28:56 <ayecee>	same thing that happens if a page is needed while a disk is resetting, i guess.
Mar 04 17:28:58 <livingbeef>	no, it's just a piece of sotware that takes a really long time and RAM to compile and
Mar 04 17:29:46 <ayecee>	livingbeef: right, but it wouldn't take nearly as much ram with a limited parallel build, or a serial build.
Mar 04 17:30:29 <livingbeef>	no, the gcc processes don't share ram
Mar 04 17:30:46 <ayecee>	"use as much memory as you can"  "no, not like that"
Mar 04 17:31:05 <livingbeef>	bigger j = more gcc processes = more ram eaten
Mar 04 17:31:18 <krushia>	looking for a (graphical) web browser that opens instantly, for the purposes of showing a single webpage from a shell script. any suggestions?
Mar 04 17:31:28 <livingbeef>	usually not an issue, but qtwebengine compilations in particular eat a lot of ram
Mar 04 17:31:46 <ayecee>	if run with large -j values, yes.
Mar 04 17:32:08 <livingbeef>	no, even just regular, like -j10 with 16G of ram
Mar 04 17:32:16 <ayecee>	-j10 is a large value.
Mar 04 17:32:38 <livingbeef>	j10 is about what you'd use on 4c processor
Mar 04 17:32:44 <livingbeef>	it's not large at all
Mar 04 17:33:07 <ayecee>	i see we have different perspectives on this. that's fine.
Mar 04 17:34:00 <livingbeef>	or at least 8; why'd use leave a part of the cpu unutilized?
Mar 04 17:34:21 <ayecee>	because of steeply diminishing returns.
Mar 04 17:34:44 <livingbeef>	-j8 on 4c/8t cpu isn't diminishing returns
Mar 04 17:34:52 <ayecee>	it sure is.
Mar 04 17:35:06 <ayecee>	it's sure not anywhere near twice as fast as -j 4.
Mar 04 17:35:43 <livingbeef>	no, it's like 1.5x
Mar 04 17:35:51 <livingbeef>	which is substantial
Mar 04 17:35:59 <ayecee>	i don't think it's even that much.
Mar 04 17:36:23 <ayecee>	the threads still share core compute units and there's only so many of those to go around.
Mar 04 17:36:37 <livingbeef>	depends a lot on the kind of workload
Mar 04 17:36:45 <ayecee>	sure. it depends.
Mar 04 17:36:51 <ayecee>	the traditional handwave.
Mar 04 17:37:05 <livingbeef>	compilation is more ifs and elses than a lot of int ops
Mar 04 17:37:10 <ananke>	in my experience with very large values on systems that do have that many sockets/cores is that the first limit you run into very quickly is storage and its performance
Mar 04 17:37:43 <ayecee>	livingbeef: sure, and you have a bunch of threads doing that same kind of task.
Mar 04 17:38:02 <ananke>	there's no fast and set rule. if you do it often enough, benchmark your system and find the cut-off point
Mar 04 17:38:29 <livingbeef>	people smarter than you made recommendation and the recommendation was # of threads + 1
Mar 04 17:38:57 <ayecee>	appeal to authority. nice.
Mar 04 17:39:43 <ananke>	same way as 'recommendation was' to have swap the size of 2x RAM.
Mar 04 17:40:27 <ananke>	what made sense in early days with fewer cores/threads per socket, doesn't translate so well as those scaled up
Mar 04 17:40:29 <ayecee>	a simplified heuristic that is treated like a rule.
Mar 04 17:41:04 <agent314>	yo
Mar 04 17:41:27 <livingbeef>	4c/8t isn't "many threads", i7 had that like 14 years ago
Mar 04 17:41:48 <ananke>	hell, use --load-average instead if you want a single setting
Mar 04 17:42:05 <ayecee>	the recommendation you cite is even older than that.
Mar 04 17:42:43 <ayecee>	from the early days of smp, before smt even.
Mar 04 17:43:28 <agent314>	what are we talking about the end of CPU frequency growth and moores law?
Mar 04 17:43:34 <ayecee>	nope!
Mar 04 17:44:05 <livingbeef>	he's saying that smt is fake and useless
Mar 04 17:44:10 <ayecee>	also nope.
Mar 04 17:45:42 <ayecee>	more accurate to say that 4c/8t is a marginal gain over 4c in parallel compiles.
Mar 04 17:46:54 *	agent314 just had a dumbo moment wondering what 4c/8t was 
Mar 04 17:47:17 <MacGyver>	ayecee: Marginal gain is still a gain, so I don't really understand your point about why you'd not actually use the additional threads even if the returns aren't "twice as fast".
Mar 04 17:47:53 <ayecee>	MacGyver: i think that's just because you missed the context of the conversation.
Mar 04 17:48:08 <agent314>	i mean maybe in ideal world 4c/8t is meaningless in comparison to just 4c
Mar 04 17:48:48 <MacGyver>	ayecee: I didn't, it went off the rails when livingbeef argued that there aren't any diminishing returns -- I'm trying to get back to the logic why you would "leave a part of the CPU unutilized" -- "Because of steeply diminishing returns'.
Mar 04 17:49:18 <ayecee>	okay, then i don't understand which part you don't understand.
Mar 04 17:49:33 <ayecee>	you seem to have captured it fairly well.
Mar 04 17:49:37 <MacGyver>	ayecee: The hyperthreads are there. Why would you not use them?
Mar 04 17:49:43 <MacGyver>	ayecee: It's not *slower* to use them.
Mar 04 17:49:57 <ayecee>	it doubles the memory footprint. it for sure can be slower.
Mar 04 17:49:57 *	ski . o O ( <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law> )
Mar 04 17:50:08 <ananke>	it's worth pointing out that there is a sharp decline in ROI on the higher number of threads: context switching. you end up with less work per wall clock unit at that point
Mar 04 17:50:20 <MacGyver>	ayecee: Ah, right, if you don't have the memory to actually back it then it'll be slower.
Mar 04 17:50:31 <livingbeef>	at that point, you have basically 0 cache hits anyway, that doesn't make a difference
Mar 04 17:50:45 <livingbeef>	what does make a difference at that point is more threads
Mar 04 17:50:51 <ayecee>	even if you _have_ the memory, that's memory that can't be used for other tasks, or for caching that would improve io performance.
Mar 04 17:50:52 <livingbeef>	since the core is stalled on memory fetch anyways
Mar 04 17:51:00 <newpy>	if I have a directory dir/ can I make a subdirectory that is a symlink for the parent directory (except itself to avoid any infinite recursion?)
Mar 04 17:51:29 <ski>	no
Mar 04 17:51:45 <ananke>	newpy: yes
Mar 04 17:51:51 <ayecee>	newpy: you can make a symlink that points to the parent directory, but the symlink isn't a directory.
Mar 04 17:52:36 <livingbeef>	That depends on cache size, but when you're looking at 1G for a tread, you'll hardly have any cache hits either way
Mar 04 17:52:58 <ski>	`ln -s .. foo' (or `ln -s /absolute/path/to/parent foo') won't make `foo/foo' an invalid path
Mar 04 17:53:07 <newpy>	hmm, if I have dir/file1, dir/file2, dir/linkdir, can linkdir be used by processes with path "dir/linkdir/file1" ?
Mar 04 17:53:21 <ayecee>	yes
Mar 04 17:53:23 <ananke>	newpy: mkdir -p testdir ; ln -s .. testdir/subdir
Mar 04 17:53:43 <bombastick>	brand new Debian system, logrotate not working on a specific service I configured in /etc/logrotate.d/myservice. If I run "logrotate -v /etc/logrotate.d/myservice" it works. fml.
Mar 04 17:53:46 <ski>	newpy : if `linkdir' points to `dir', yes
Mar 04 17:53:52 <bombastick>	and by "brand new" I mean Buster
Mar 04 17:53:56 <ski>	also `dir/linkdir/linkdir/file1'
Mar 04 17:54:07 <ayecee>	linkdirs all the way down
Mar 04 17:56:38 <newpy>	ananke, I think that ln was pointing to the parent dir of testdir
Mar 04 17:56:46 <newpy>	I wiped the entire parent directory when rm -rf'ing lol
Mar 04 17:57:50 <ayecee>	livingbeef: i'll concede that the gains for -j 8 over -j 4 on a 4c/8t aren't zero, but i'll maintain that the side effects detract or reverse that gain when wallclock time is not the only metric, and the computer is not dedicated solely to this one task.
Mar 04 17:59:03 <newpy_>	hmm
Mar 04 17:59:11 <newpy_>	sorry did I miss any replies?
Mar 04 17:59:13 <newpy_>	got d/c'ed
Mar 04 17:59:18 <bombastick>	ayecee: they are literally zero. I tried it. I got into a discussion with the Qt maintainer on IRC over it, he didnt believe me, decided to compile Qt with make -j $realcores vs make -j $hyperthreading-marketing-bullshit, and he saw it with his own eyes
Mar 04 17:59:33 <bombastick>	and that was on their supercomputer they use to build Qt
Mar 04 17:59:45 <bombastick>	me, I tried it with various packages on my 4-core laptop
Mar 04 17:59:49 <ayecee>	well there's a datapoint.
Mar 04 18:00:01 <ski_>	<ski> no  <ski> `ln -s .. foo' (or `ln -s /absolute/path/to/parent foo') won't make `foo/foo' an invalid path  <ski> newpy : if `linkdir' points to `dir', yes  <ski> also `dir/linkdir/linkdir/file1'
Mar 04 18:00:02 <ski_>	newpy ^
Mar 04 18:00:17 <peac>	when compiling linux kernel with high j value i get race condition errors
Mar 04 18:00:20 <ayecee>	oh livingbeef is gone
Mar 04 18:02:00 <Lolo>	eeeeee
Mar 04 18:02:52 <ayecee>	bombastick: i reckon it could have some small gain in cases that were cpu bound. like ananke suggests, it often gets io-bound.
Mar 04 18:03:43 <ayecee>	but yeah, not 2x or 1.5x. maybe 1.1x, downhill and with wind?
Mar 04 18:04:10 <bombastick>	Can't imagine many things more CPU-bound than compiling a massive project like Qt. I guess videogames, or llama.cpp (ie AI on your CPU)
Mar 04 18:04:22 <bombastick>	*some videogames
Mar 04 18:05:02 <ayecee>	there's a lot of cpu, but there's also a lot of io, and especially a lot of small io.
Mar 04 18:05:30 <bombastick>	I unironically think hyperthreading only exists because it let Intel advertise more "cores" without actually doing more cores. It's their way of competing. Like they are now with that efficiency core crap. (at least with those I get their usefulness, but I maintain they only exist because AMD is absolutely destroying them on real CPU core count)
Mar 04 18:05:39 <ayecee>	distributed.net would definitely be more cpu bound :D
Mar 04 18:05:49 <xiaomiao>	bombastick: the funny thing is that the E-cores are not efficient
Mar 04 18:05:56 <xiaomiao>	they are just lower total power!
Mar 04 18:06:13 <bombastick>	no way...are you saying they are physically identical to real cores?
Mar 04 18:06:34 <ayecee>	identical to real cores but with less features that need power.
Mar 04 18:06:34 <MacGyver>	bombastick: It doesn't exist only for that reason, and the principle of using superscalar architectures more efficiently works *generally*.
Mar 04 18:06:56 <MacGyver>	bombastick: Your datapoint does seem to imply that your compilation jobs are doing something for which the core only has one compute unit, or for which parallel gains are dwarfed by some other overhead.
Mar 04 18:06:59 <ayecee>	features that need power on regular cores even when they're not being used.
Mar 04 18:07:05 <MacGyver>	bombastick: But compiling software isn't the only thing CPUs do.
Mar 04 18:07:26 <bombastick>	I see
Mar 04 18:07:37 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 04 18:07:38 *	litharge sets ban on $a:tinhatcat$##fix_your_connection
Mar 04 18:07:39 *	litharge has kicked tinhatcat1 from #linux (Discuss your ban in #linux-ops.)
Mar 04 18:07:44 <ayecee>	MacGyver: they're often used to chat about compiling too!
Mar 04 18:07:47 <newpy>	ski, when mkdir testdir, cd testdir, touch file1, ln -s .. foo, I can `file file1` but not `file foo/file1` (no such file or directory)
Mar 04 18:07:48 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 04 18:08:20 <peac>	CPUs are mostly used in relation to cat activities. Like looking at cat gifs.
Mar 04 18:08:24 <ayecee>	newpy: file -s foo/file1
Mar 04 18:08:32 <ayecee>	file doesn't follow symlinks unless you ask it to.
Mar 04 18:08:53 <newpy>	ayecee, no dice
Mar 04 18:08:57 <newpy>	oh I see
Mar 04 18:09:19 <newpy>	I can't cat foo/file1 either
Mar 04 18:09:22 <MacGyver>	bombastick: The idea is that each core can have, say, multiple floating point units, and multiple arithmetic logic units, and multiple other building blocks for which a single core would need *at least* one, and rearrange the instructions so that ideally every cycle, every unit is active doing *something*.
Mar 04 18:09:36 <hodapp>	bombastick: the ability to advertise more cores is certainly part of it, but also, hyperthreading is present in many other CPU arches.
Mar 04 18:09:45 <ayecee>	newpy: huh. guess i'll have to test it here.
Mar 04 18:09:53 <ski>	newpy : er, sorry, `..' would be to the parent directory. `.' would be to present. so instead of `foo/foo', you'd have `foo/current/foo', where `current' is the name of the present one
Mar 04 18:09:55 <MacGyver>	bombastick: Intel is actually going to abandon the hyperthread model to take this a step further.
Mar 04 18:09:55 <bombastick>	when I got my AMD 3700X in 2020 (my first PC upgrade since the i5-2500 in 2011), i must have spent like an hour just recompiling my projects with a grin on my face seeing how fast they built
Mar 04 18:10:29 <ski>	newpy : in your last example `file foo/testdir/file1' works fine
Mar 04 18:10:50 <hodapp>	bombastick: it still allows more efficient use of the various units internally that the CPU has - especially if the CPU is meant to be used by many concurrent jobs at once, particularly ones that are going to be stalled waiting for memory anyway
Mar 04 18:10:52 <ayecee>	newpy: ohh, ln -s . foo
Mar 04 18:11:35 <ski>	newpy : did you mean parent directory of the files in question (including the symbolic link), or did you mean the parent directory of the current directory ?
Mar 04 18:11:44 <hodapp>	the case where it *doesn't* help is where all threads are already saturating what the CPU has available
Mar 04 18:12:04 <bombastick>	If I can just do a realistic (non-synthetic Intel-designed) benchmark where I can see its advantage I'd be OK with it. I'm not just a hater, I'm just disillusioned from my own benchmark.
Mar 04 18:12:06 <ayecee>	newpy: with ln -s . foo, then cat foo/file1 works.
Mar 04 18:12:11 <MacGyver>	Or if all the threads need the same execution unit at the same time.
Mar 04 18:12:24 <bombastick>	and it's the same for new P/E-cores (though I'm not likely to get another PC for another 5 years)
Mar 04 18:13:25 <bombastick>	I'm open-minded, about pretty much anything, except furries and Ts
Mar 04 18:13:28 <hodapp>	that's harder to make use of, but for threads that are just going to be doing low-priority, low-compute-intensity tasks, it makes far more sense for a simpler, slower core to handle that
Mar 04 18:13:39 <hodapp>	Ts?
Mar 04 18:13:44 <ayecee>	don't ask
Mar 04 18:13:47 <hodapp>	9_9
Mar 04 18:13:49 <bombastick>	don't tell
Mar 04 18:14:02 <jensen>	anyone use a "layer" key like Extend on a non-programmable keyboard? is kmonad, keyd, interception-tools, etc. most versatile for configuring a non-programmable keyboard as if it's progammable? i want to replicate my programmable keyboard on a builtin laptop keyboard
Mar 04 18:14:12 <ssm_>	bombastick: owo
Mar 04 18:14:25 <jensen>	or use miryoku layout on non-programmable keyboard
Mar 04 18:14:39 <ayecee>	bombastick: put the dog whistle away while you're here, please.
Mar 04 18:14:55 <van2024>	What program and file extension should I use to save text notes into an associative array?
Mar 04 18:15:14 <hodapp>	van2024: err. what? like a dictionary/hash?
Mar 04 18:16:15 <hodapp>	if it's something like 1,000 notes, JSON is probably fine with whatever language + library (e.g. Python & stdlib json). if it's more like 1,000,000...
Mar 04 18:16:25 <van2024>	hodapp, tag-line number-note text
Mar 04 18:16:27 <ssm_>	ayecee: at least he explicitly admitted he is not open-minded about certain things, what a great entertainer he is
Mar 04 18:17:00 <bombastick>	ayecee: lol I dont even dislike them, I just know it hits a nerve with the strict ops here so I like a little dig every now and then to keep things spicy. I know where the line is and I try to stay just barely under it.
Mar 04 18:17:01 <hodapp>	van2024: where you need to look up the text by tag-line? exact match always? fuzzy match?
Mar 04 18:17:39 <hodapp>	bombastick: mayonnaise doesn't become spicy just because people don't like it
Mar 04 18:17:41 <hodapp>	it's still just mayonnaise
Mar 04 18:17:43 <ayecee>	bombastick: yup. you sure do. don't do a dance on the line now.
Mar 04 18:18:20 <van2024>	hodapp, fuzzy search by tag, in case I forget the tag
Mar 04 18:18:35 <hodapp>	van2024: and about how many notes are we talking?
Mar 04 18:19:30 <bombastick>	I just dont like the HR-ification of IRC that happened in the past 10-15 years
Mar 04 18:20:29 <hodapp>	"I don't like that it's become incredibly easy to sort my viewpoint into the garbage bin, so I fight it by making it easier"
Mar 04 18:21:04 <ayecee>	let's get back to linux.
Mar 04 18:21:12 <van2024>	hodapp, approximately 100 tags
Mar 04 18:21:31 <hodapp>	van2024: for something like that, could probably just get away with a text file and judicious use of fzf.
Mar 04 18:22:38 <hodapp>	for only 100 tags, that is approaching "just visually inspect a list of tags" range
Mar 04 18:24:34 <bombastick>	speaking of tags, is anyone else abandoning Evernote? 2 weeks until the legacy (desktop native) version stops working
Mar 04 18:24:53 <bombastick>	also they doubled their prices in dEcember
Mar 04 18:25:07 <ayecee>	i'm vaguely aware that evernote exists
Mar 04 18:25:35 <bombastick>	ayecee: how do you manage your personal knowledge? Surely  you dont rely on your memory or Google for everything?
Mar 04 18:26:20 <ayecee>	i remember how to locate the knowledge. sparse storage, on-demand loading.
Mar 04 18:26:53 <ayecee>	have to. my memory is pretty small.
Mar 04 18:27:14 <ssm_>	I literally put a plain text file in $HOME when I need to remember something
Mar 04 18:27:20 <ssm_>	has worked fine for years
Mar 04 18:27:21 <Zewwy>	ayecee: <3
Mar 04 18:27:27 <ayecee>	heya Zewwy
Mar 04 18:29:38 <hodapp>	I use org-mode but don't rely on a ton of its features, just things like intra-file and inter-file links and tags, and most of my searching is just text searching by heading until I find what I was after
Mar 04 18:30:04 <hodapp>	it's worked so far for ~10 years of notes put into there and another 5 years of notes converted over
Mar 04 18:30:12 <bombastick>	ayecee: but it's pretty time-consuming to find this info on Google. For example I have this as my own reference sheet: https://i.imgur.com/NOceUkA.png . It's a summary of at least an hour of googling, that I can now find in an instant.
Mar 04 18:30:44 <ayecee>	i guess i also send emails to myself for some things.
Mar 04 18:31:13 <kfrench>	ayecee: Do you ever reply with a "done"?
Mar 04 18:31:22 <ayecee>	heh. no, but that's a pretty good idea.
Mar 04 18:33:57 <ayecee>	i've been using google's Tasks app recently, but i could also do that with email, since my inbox is something i check regularly.
Mar 04 18:34:26 <Lolo>	help pls
Mar 04 18:34:42 <Lolo>	setup data Quake 3 on Ubuntu
Mar 04 18:34:47 <saganman>	no push notifications for email?
Mar 04 18:35:04 <ayecee>	how do you mean?
Mar 04 18:35:29 <saganman>	I mean you get notified of new email.
Mar 04 18:35:48 <ayecee>	i do
Mar 04 18:36:16 <ayecee>	that tells me when they arrive, and i keep them in my inbox until i've handled them.
Mar 04 18:36:34 <ayecee>	so i check my inbox to see what's left to handle.
Mar 04 18:36:41 <peac>	I use a readme file at the root of each project that has a list of todos and done
Mar 04 18:36:54 <saganman>	gotcha
Mar 04 18:37:02 <peac>	generally im also thin-provisioning knowledge
Mar 04 18:37:19 <saganman>	I usually do that once in couple of days or so
Mar 04 18:41:45 <aboutKickSecure>	hello there, i have seen in the kicksecure document that a minimal installation of debian is preferred for distro-morph into KS. But, i currently have a linux mint distro installed on my machine. can i run the commands of this document - https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Debian on this linux mint and expect it to work. because, mint is based of
Mar 04 18:41:46 <aboutKickSecure>	ubuntu, which is inturn a based on debian as you might already know ...
Mar 04 18:41:54 <jamea>	hi all
Mar 04 18:41:55 <jamea>	i have a big file CSV 1 100 000 rows.. the algorithm, 1) open it 2) sort by first field(is numerical) 3) save it to another filen csv name is possible with bash?
Mar 04 18:42:16 <aboutKickSecure>	its possible jamea
Mar 04 18:43:23 <jamea>	aboutKickSecure how to pls
Mar 04 18:43:32 <AndyCap>	jamea: something like sort file.csv -k 1 -n -t , > your-new-file.csv
Mar 04 18:43:43 <Khaytsus>	jamea: https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sorting/
Mar 04 18:43:48 <AndyCap>	assuming you mean comma by csv.
Mar 04 18:43:57 <aboutKickSecure>	jamea - $ cat FILENAME.csv | sort > newFile.csv - you might need to learn the options of the sort command to check how it works
Mar 04 18:45:04 <aboutKickSecure>	sure AndyCap seems to given you the solution, jamea - test it out with just 10 rows or so using head command and then run it on all.. good luck
Mar 04 18:45:13 <jamea>	ok, thanks
Mar 04 18:45:23 <jamea>	much thanks
Mar 04 18:52:46 <Siecje>	I'm trying to get an encrypted partition. Since the partition needs to be empty to encrypt it, what is a good way to populate the partition with a distro?
Mar 04 18:53:02 <Umeaboy>	I know that libindicator hasn't been actively developed in 7 years (I checked the launchpad page for it), am I supposed to replace with ayatana?
Mar 04 18:53:16 <ayecee>	Siecje: a good way is to step through a normal distro installation.
Mar 04 18:54:12 <ayecee>	bombastick: i guess email is kind of adhoc for that. a dedicated app likely has features more suitable to this task.
Mar 04 18:54:16 <Siecje>	And when you target the partition it will encrypt as it writes? Without overwriting the encryption headers etc?
Mar 04 18:54:46 <Siecje>	Can you dd the partition without issue?
Mar 04 18:54:54 <monr0e>	I have a silly problem. I want to install a package that "requires" pulseaudio. I made a dummy pulseaudio package, but it conflicts with pipewire. I don't want to fuck around with unisntalling and reinstalling pipewire anymore, so is it possible to remove a conflict in an already installed package?
Mar 04 18:54:56 <djph>	Siecje: most distros will install to a LUKS-container as a select-able step in the install process
Mar 04 18:55:07 <ayecee>	Siecje: it's possible. like manual partitioning, it's a bit more involved.
Mar 04 18:55:12 <Khaytsus>	Please wtch the language monr0e
Mar 04 18:55:53 <gog>	monr0e: does your distro have pipewire-pulse?
Mar 04 18:55:57 <monr0e>	no
Mar 04 18:56:01 <gog>	hmm
Mar 04 18:56:09 <ayecee>	Siecje: i don't know what you mean by dd the partition, with regards to installing a distro.
Mar 04 18:56:09 <monr0e>	hang on, let me make sure of that
Mar 04 18:56:25 <monr0e>	yeah no, purely pipewire
Mar 04 18:56:25 <ssm_>	monr0e: which distro?
Mar 04 18:56:30 <Khaytsus>	monr0e: You shouldn't need to do any of that nonsense
Mar 04 18:56:31 <monr0e>	ssm_ debian 12
Mar 04 18:56:36 <Khaytsus>	All sane distros are just going to work
Mar 04 18:56:48 <Siecje>	ayecee: I'm trying to automate it. Do I need to boot the distro ISO and then install manually?
Mar 04 18:56:57 <MacGyver>	monr0e: If you have pipewire installed, the dependency chain on pulseaudio should be resolved by that.
Mar 04 18:57:30 <MacGyver>	If it's not, that sounds like you need the actual pulseaudio integration package or a system update or somesuch.
Mar 04 18:57:45 <monr0e>	it's not a pipewire problem, it's a separate package that I need. It doesn't actually require pulseaudio
Mar 04 18:58:05 <monr0e>	and because it comes in multiple packages, I can't just apt download it
Mar 04 18:58:28 <Khaytsus>	monr0e: You asked in a debian channel?  100% sure there will be a package for what you need.
Mar 04 18:58:46 <Khaytsus>	perhaps use dpkg to search for the file/header/whatever?
Mar 04 18:58:46 <monr0e>	I'm looking very specifically for cairo-dock
Mar 04 18:58:50 <ayecee>	Siecje: i imagine it depends on what automation options the installer provides. seems like a lot of work for a one-off install though.
Mar 04 18:59:09 <Siecje>	ayecee: It's for 50.
Mar 04 18:59:15 <ayecee>	well alright then.
Mar 04 18:59:17 <monr0e>	the pulseaudio dependency is noted my a plugin, which I can disable after installation
Mar 04 18:59:42 <Trasp>	Siecje: To keep the headers you'd either unlock it in the installer or manually run cryptsetup, depending on the distro being installed.
Mar 04 19:00:40 <ayecee>	Siecje: so, it _can_ be automated, but there isn't a simple and easy path for doing so.
Mar 04 19:01:44 <Siecje>	I can use buildroot to create the file tree etc but then it won't be encrypted.
Mar 04 19:02:17 <ayecee>	why's that?
Mar 04 19:02:24 <Siecje>	Can I copy the partition to a temp partition encrypt the empty partition and then put the files back and encrypt them?
Mar 04 19:02:39 <ayecee>	sure
Mar 04 19:02:41 <Siecje>	ayecee: Since the partition needs to be empty to be encrypted?
Mar 04 19:02:51 <Siecje>	Or are you saying to get buildroot to encrypt?
Mar 04 19:03:58 <ayecee>	i imagine it can, but if it doesn't, i imagine you could also mount the encrypted partition first before buildroot does its thing.
Mar 04 19:04:33 <MacGyver>	monr0e: My point is that if the package "requires" pulseaudio, that *shouldn't* mean *you* need to put a dummy pulseaudio package in place; that should be handled by the package manager recognizing that pipewire provides the required functionality.
Mar 04 19:04:52 <MacGyver>	monr0e: I think you'll need https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/pipewire-pulse for that though.
Mar 04 19:05:19 <Siecje>	ayecee: build root creates disk images.
Mar 04 19:05:49 <ayecee>	i see.
Mar 04 19:06:15 <MacGyver>	monr0e: If pipewire-pulse doesn't satisfy that requirement, and you can't install cairo-dock without it, that sounds like a packaging bug to report to Debian.
Mar 04 19:06:55 <ayecee>	Siecje: i guess that's an image you could write to the luks container once you unlock it.
Mar 04 19:07:14 <ayecee>	then it would be encrypted.
Mar 04 19:07:25 <ayecee>	like, write with dd.
Mar 04 19:08:32 <monr0e>	MacGyver: My pipewire solution is a bit of a bodge job, because debian's repository is rather out of date and I wanted easyeffects. I technically have pipewire-pulse installed, but it doesn't seem to be recognised properly. It works, certainly, but ya. And I doubt Debian are going to adjust their packaging solution just for me, hence my attempt to macgyver (sorry) a solution
Mar 04 19:09:26 <ayecee>	ah. some software was installed outside of the packaging system.
Mar 04 19:09:33 <monr0e>	not even
Mar 04 19:09:59 <monr0e>	I bodged together pipewire 1.0.3 using repositories that technically I shouldn't be using on bookworm
Mar 04 19:10:31 <ayecee>	i guess i'm not sure what "doesn't seem to be recognised properly" means then.
Mar 04 19:10:33 <monr0e>	before i realised that it was available in backports too, because I didn;t realise that search results don't include backports
Mar 04 19:10:37 <MacGyver>	I don't know apt anywhere near well enough to know where it encodes the things the package provides, but it sounds like that's the part that needs fixing here.
Mar 04 19:10:47 <monr0e>	ayecee: https://paste.debian.net/1309436/
Mar 04 19:10:52 <MacGyver>	The dependency *should* be recognized as satisfied.
Mar 04 19:11:23 <ayecee>	monr0e: what am i looking at here? what should i see instead?
Mar 04 19:12:14 <monr0e>	ayecee: If the second command returns "PulseAudio (on PipeWire x)", the first command should show pipewire-pulse as installed. Instead it does not
Mar 04 19:12:36 <monr0e>	also it shows the x86 version for some reason
Mar 04 19:12:41 <ayecee>	what would it look like if it were installed?
Mar 04 19:13:01 <monr0e>	it would be followed by [installed/<source>]
Mar 04 19:13:11 <ayecee>	ah
Mar 04 19:13:47 <monr0e>	so apt believes that pipewire-pulse is not installed, hence my problem. Reinstalling all of this would not only take far too long, I don't know that it wouldn't break stuff
Mar 04 19:14:13 <ayecee>	okay, so where is the running pulse server from?
Mar 04 19:14:18 <monr0e>	trixie
Mar 04 19:14:21 <monr0e>	i.e. testing
Mar 04 19:14:30 <ayecee>	okay, what's the package name?
Mar 04 19:14:41 <monr0e>	um
Mar 04 19:14:52 <ayecee>	like, you installed this from a package, right?
Mar 04 19:14:56 <monr0e>	pipewire-pulse/testing 1.0.3 afaicr
Mar 04 19:15:00 <monr0e>	one sec
Mar 04 19:15:27 <ayecee>	okay but like you said, your package manager doesn't show it as installed.
Mar 04 19:15:54 <Siecje>	What does it mean if `lsblk` doesn't show anything mounted?
Mar 04 19:16:08 <ayecee>	Siecje: probably means you're not doing it as root.
Mar 04 19:16:33 <ayecee>	or, that you're doing it in a chroot.
Mar 04 19:16:41 <Siecje>	ayecee: Same as root.
Mar 04 19:16:52 <MacGyver>	I don't think chroot matters, mount namespace does.
Mar 04 19:17:06 <monr0e>	ayecee also, that repo is expected to be problematic. I had some other issues too, namely forcing the ignorance of dependencies via dpkg, so that I could work through the chain of dependencies and replace them all with the repo that apt doesn'tlook in by default
Mar 04 19:17:14 <MacGyver>	But I can't test.
Mar 04 19:17:23 <ayecee>	i had in mind a chroot in which the /proc, /sys etc hadn't been mounted.
Mar 04 19:17:38 <ayecee>	monr0e: does dpkg -l pipewire-pulse show results?
Mar 04 19:17:42 <Siecje>	I'm in the initramfs? What is needed on a partition (or disk) to switch to that?
Mar 04 19:18:05 <monr0e>	ayecee yes, that shows the 1.0.3 package
Mar 04 19:18:06 <ayecee>	Siecje: you're bushwhacking in uncharted territory, my man
Mar 04 19:18:14 <MacGyver>	Siecje: One or two steps back -- what are you trying to do?
Mar 04 19:18:23 <ayecee>	monr0e: okay, so the package is installed, and apt search is not a reliable way of testing if it's installed.
Mar 04 19:18:39 <monr0e>	correct
Mar 04 19:18:54 <ayecee>	monr0e: so, rewinding a bit, what's the problem?
Mar 04 19:18:57 <Siecje>	MacGyver: Get a shell in an encrypted filesystem.
Mar 04 19:19:28 <Siecje>	Or boot into it and run something.
Mar 04 19:19:46 <ayecee>	monr0e: what are you trying to install, and what shows that it doesn't detect pipewire-pulse correctly?
Mar 04 19:20:22 <MacGyver>	Siecje: Is the encrypted filesystem the root partition as well?
Mar 04 19:20:39 <ayecee>	root filesystem* :D
Mar 04 19:20:44 <Siecje>	MacGyver: Once it is loaded yes.
Mar 04 19:20:48 <MacGyver>	Uh, root filesystem, yes.
Mar 04 19:21:24 <Siecje>	boot partition is not encrypted (but it is signed) I want to switch to encrypted filesystem.
Mar 04 19:21:37 <MacGyver>	Siecje: You'll need to cryptsetup open the encrypted partition, then mount whatever it exposes.
Mar 04 19:21:45 <monr0e>	ayecee: I am installing cairo-dock. A plugin (that cannot be avoided in installation) depends on pulseaudio. I can remove that plugin post-installation. In order to provide that pulseaudio dependency, I created a dummy package for pulseaudio. That conflicts with pipewire. I'm looking to remove that conflict in the already-installed pipewire, so that I can install the dummy package
Mar 04 19:21:58 <MacGyver>	Siecje: For that to happen, the required encryption modules and binaries need to be present in the initramfs.
Mar 04 19:22:05 <ayecee>	monr0e: what does that conflict look like
Mar 04 19:22:15 <Siecje>	MacGyver: It's empty. I can encrypt it but how do I make it the root filesystem? What does it need?
Mar 04 19:22:28 <Siecje>	MacGyver: initramfs has what it needs.
Mar 04 19:22:34 <MacGyver>	Siecje: You'll need to take another two steps back.
Mar 04 19:22:58 <MacGyver>	Siecje: "Making an empty filesystem the root filesystem" is either not what you mean, or not what you actually want.
Mar 04 19:23:17 <Siecje>	Correct, what do I need on there?
Mar 04 19:23:35 <monr0e>	ayecee: https://paste.debian.net/1309438/
Mar 04 19:23:56 <MacGyver>	Are you trying to install Linux from scratch without any instructions or what?
Mar 04 19:24:50 <monr0e>	ayecee: the other possibility is that I can somehow tell apt to ignore that specific conflict this time. If that were possible, it would be a much cleaner solution
Mar 04 19:24:57 <Siecje>	MacGyver: The boot partition has the kernel. As far as I understand the other partition does not need Linux.
Mar 04 19:25:02 <ayecee>	monr0e: what provides pulseaudio? i'm checking now how to see the list of packages that would satisfy it.
Mar 04 19:26:09 <MacGyver>	Siecje: You need the entire userland that actually makes it an operating system and not just a kernel.
Mar 04 19:26:40 <MacGyver>	Siecje: Usually installed using an installer or at the very least a set of clear instructions and some scripts.
Mar 04 19:27:00 <MacGyver>	Siecje: Whether or not the underlying block device is encrypted is mostly irrelevant.
Mar 04 19:27:14 <MacGyver>	Siecje: As in, it changes very little about the things you need to do.
Mar 04 19:27:39 <arcturus>	what distro is it
Mar 04 19:27:58 <monr0e>	ayecee: Does "suggests" count? Because libpulse0 suggests pulseaudio
Mar 04 19:28:14 <ayecee>	monr0e: wait, does pipewire-pulse provide a pulse server, or does it provide a pulse backend for pipewire?
Mar 04 19:28:32 <MacGyver>	ayecee, monr0e: "E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages."
Mar 04 19:28:49 <monr0e>	ayecee: It provides a pulse backend afaik
Mar 04 19:28:51 <MacGyver>	ayecee, monr0e: To me that line signals "none of this matters, there's an underlying error that needs fixing to have any hope of a sensible solution".
Mar 04 19:29:23 <ayecee>	MacGyver: i don't think that's correct.
Mar 04 19:29:54 <monr0e>	MacGyver: In this instance, it is because no pulseaudio candidate is a suitable replacement for the version of pipewire that I have installed, despite there being a version in the repo - thus it thinks something is borken
Mar 04 19:30:28 <ayecee>	well no, it means that this package depends on a package named pulseaudio, which is not installed
Mar 04 19:30:45 <monr0e>	usually apt would seek to install a dependency, no?
Mar 04 19:30:48 <ayecee>	and doesn't have an installation candidate.
Mar 04 19:31:19 <ioria>	 pipewire-pulse 0.3.58-1 is now in conflict with pulseaudio to avoid a fight between both audio server
Mar 04 19:31:25 <monr0e>	exactly - pulseaudio can't be cleanly replaced here, because half of the pipewire packages I'm running aren;t properly recognised by apt
Mar 04 19:31:41 <ayecee>	they are recognized. we checked that.
Mar 04 19:32:00 <ayecee>	what happens if you apt install pulseaudio?
Mar 04 19:32:04 <monr0e>	by dpgk yes, but does that necessarily mean apt can see them?
Mar 04 19:32:08 <ayecee>	it should fail, and the way it fails will provide more info
Mar 04 19:32:15 <ayecee>	yes, it means apt can see them
Mar 04 19:32:20 <monr0e>	oh hell, I am notattempting that lmao
Mar 04 19:32:27 <monr0e>	oh wait hang on
Mar 04 19:32:40 <monr0e>	can I force the confirmation dialog to absolutely show in apt?
Mar 04 19:32:54 <ayecee>	probably. there's almost certainly a dry run option too.
Mar 04 19:33:00 <bombastick>	ayecee: re: note apps, if you're not averse to Electron, StandardNotes is a freemium FOSS app with automatic sync between your desktop and phone (100MB storage), and it's "zero knowledge" encrypted so they cant access your notes. The main advantage for this stuff is also having a phone app, especially if you use for more than just tech/career stuff.
Mar 04 19:33:06 <monr0e>	Dry run would be great, lemme have a looksee
Mar 04 19:33:41 <ioria>	apt -s install ....
Mar 04 19:33:53 <bombastick>	StandardNotes has been active for like 8 years now I think, so it's a serious app
Mar 04 19:33:57 <ayecee>	bombastick: i mean, my email is also avaible as a phone app. the zero knowledge thing sounds like a selling point though.
Mar 04 19:34:13 <monr0e>	ayecee: yep, apt can see them
Mar 04 19:34:27 <monr0e>	wants to remove pipewire-alsa and pipewire-audio
Mar 04 19:34:31 <monr0e>	but not pipewire itself?
Mar 04 19:34:38 <monr0e>	or wireplumber
Mar 04 19:35:07 <ayecee>	got it. thanks for checking that.
Mar 04 19:36:03 <birkoff>	my wifi kernel driver goes in and out of promiscuous mode every 5 minutes, how can I debug it ?
Mar 04 19:36:13 <bombastick>	I just wish these tools had something from "free 100MB plan" to "$100 monster plan". Like give me something cheaper with 1GB storage, you know?
Mar 04 19:36:25 <bombastick>	100MB is more than enough for text-only, but occasionally I like to attach images
Mar 04 19:36:34 <monr0e>	hmmm. I'm going to try and not install the plugin, although I;m pretty sure they're all wrapped up ina single package
Mar 04 19:36:36 <ayecee>	i see that pipewire-alsa conflicts directly with pulseaudio. so, cairo-dock depends on pulseaudio as a package name. i thought it would be a metapackage by now.
Mar 04 19:37:19 <monr0e>	it may well be to be honest
Mar 04 19:37:26 <ayecee>	doesn't look like it is from here.
Mar 04 19:37:35 <ayecee>	hmm.
Mar 04 19:37:41 <monr0e>	I really did break a lot of stuff when I bodged pipewire
Mar 04 19:37:56 <monr0e>	including stuff that plasma relies on
Mar 04 19:38:05 <monr0e>	or, rather, plasma takes over
Mar 04 19:38:21 <ayecee>	it'd be nice to have a metapackage where pulseaudio functionality could be provided by one of a set of packages.
Mar 04 19:38:54 <ayecee>	i guess it makes sense to override cairo-dock's dependency then. let's see how to do that.
Mar 04 19:39:07 <monr0e>	Honestly I'd prefer a different approach altogether to audio on linux, this sinks and sources concept is... not my cup of tea
Mar 04 19:39:23 <monr0e>	oh I can override a dependency? hmm
Mar 04 19:40:15 <ayecee>	while we're bodging here, this appears to describe how to remove the dependency rather than overriding it. https://serverfault.com/a/383958
Mar 04 19:40:19 <monr0e>	I did try modifying the entry for pipewire in /var/lib/dpkg/status but that didn't change anything, and ya
Mar 04 19:41:18 <monr0e>	oh, dpkg can pull from repos in the way apt does?
Mar 04 19:41:29 <monr0e>	because cairo-dock has other deps too
Mar 04 19:42:34 <ayecee>	i guess those could be installed separately with apt
Mar 04 19:42:52 <ayecee>	i see a reference to a --nodeps option for apt-get but i don't find it in the manpage.
Mar 04 19:43:46 <ayecee>	what a tangled web.
Mar 04 19:44:32 <ayecee>	can't really use a dummy package  for this since the pipewire package explicitly conflicts with the name that dummy package would need.
Mar 04 19:45:29 <monr0e>	that was the original problem - I wanted to remove that conflict somehow in the already installed package
Mar 04 19:46:33 <ayecee>	i guess you could remove the conflict by hand from the .deb file. might be in /var/apt/cache.
Mar 04 19:46:39 <monr0e>	ugh. Cairo-dock depends on its plugins, and its plugins metapackage depends on all of its plugins
Mar 04 19:46:46 <ayecee>	then, reinstall the package with dpkg -i and your modified deb.
Mar 04 19:47:03 <ayecee>	err, /var/cache/apt
Mar 04 19:47:13 <monr0e>	ya, I don't dare reinstall the pipewire package
Mar 04 19:47:28 <ayecee>	kinda need to if you want to remove the conflict.
Mar 04 19:47:29 <monr0e>	I spent a good three or four hours working on it yesterday
Mar 04 19:47:41 <ayecee>	this doesn't involve removing it.
Mar 04 19:47:55 <monr0e>	hmmm. one se
Mar 04 19:48:42 <ayecee>	'course, this house of cards will come down the next time the packages update.
Mar 04 19:49:06 <monr0e>	Bah, the pipewire package isn't in the archive anyway
Mar 04 19:50:03 <ayecee>	hmm. the cairo-dock package doesn't directly depend on pulseaudio anyway. from whence that dependency?
Mar 04 19:50:15 <monr0e>	its a plugin
Mar 04 19:50:18 <monr0e>	cairo-dock-impulse-plug-in
Mar 04 19:50:21 <ayecee>	oh right
Mar 04 19:50:25 <monr0e>	silly, right?
Mar 04 19:50:36 <monr0e>	I don't need or want that plugin, but its a dep
Mar 04 19:51:03 <ayecee>	dep of what?
Mar 04 19:51:12 <monr0e>	cairo-dock-plugins
Mar 04 19:51:19 <monr0e>	which is a dependency of cairo-dock
Mar 04 19:51:43 <silly>	left
Mar 04 19:52:04 *	monr0e groans
Mar 04 19:52:06 <ayecee>	that's frustrating, yeah.
Mar 04 19:52:18 <ioria>	you can just install cairo-dock-core without plugins (but compiling it from git)
Mar 04 19:52:19 <monr0e>	I wonder
Mar 04 19:52:52 <ayecee>	monr0e: what's the output from, apt install cairo-dock -cairo-dock-impulse-plug-in ?
Mar 04 19:53:15 <ayecee>	like, installing it but explicitly saying don't install that plugin
Mar 04 19:53:28 <monr0e>	Unable to read airo-dock-impulse-plug-in
Mar 04 19:53:34 <monr0e>	no, really
Mar 04 19:53:47 <ayecee>	oh. maybe my syntax is wrong.
Mar 04 19:53:56 <monr0e>	the hyphen at the end results in a different issue
Mar 04 19:54:12 <monr0e>	 cairo-dock-plug-ins : Depends: cairo-dock-impulse-plug-in but it is not going to be installed
Mar 04 19:54:56 <ayecee>	makes sense
Mar 04 19:57:07 <ayecee>	alright. it looks like you can remove the conflicts from the installed package more directly in /var/lib/dpkg/status.
Mar 04 19:57:14 <monr0e>	I tried that
Mar 04 19:57:16 <monr0e>	no joy
Mar 04 19:57:38 <monr0e>	there must be another step in there somewhere if that actually works
Mar 04 19:58:10 <monr0e>	rn I'm going to try removing the dependency from the impulse plugin
Mar 04 19:58:35 <ayecee>	makes sense. that'd be the easiest one to pin.
Mar 04 19:59:20 <monr0e>	problem is, I don't know if it will fall over before I get a chance to disable it
Mar 04 20:05:24 <ayecee>	maybe you can download the plugin deb, install it with dpkg -i --force-depends, then install cairo-dock?
Mar 04 20:05:56 <eyeris>	Are the names of the files in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/*.conf significant? The names match owned names on the system bus but I can't tell whether that is an organizational convention versus d-bus using those names when enforcing policies.
Mar 04 20:07:19 <ayecee>	eyeris: i don't think the filename and the interface names on the system bus need to match.
Mar 04 20:07:26 <ayecee>	err, on the dbus.
Mar 04 20:08:03 <ayecee>	like, i see bluetooth.conf which has much different interface names than the filename would suggest.
Mar 04 20:09:03 <eyeris>	ayecee: ah thanks for checking your setup
Mar 04 20:09:40 <monr0e>	ayecee: I think that might be the route to go, although apt might complain. The tar format in the deb is .xz which I don't quite get yet
Mar 04 20:10:28 <ayecee>	tar -xf gets it though
Mar 04 20:10:38 <monr0e>	it's not unpacking, its repacking
Mar 04 20:10:48 <ayecee>	tar -cf gets it though
Mar 04 20:11:13 <monr0e>	o
Mar 04 20:11:30 <ayecee>	by default, tar figures out which compresser to use by file extension.
Mar 04 20:11:39 <monr0e>	oh?
Mar 04 20:11:45 <monr0e>	https://paste.debian.net/1309452/
Mar 04 20:12:28 <ayecee>	err. how did you repack it?
Mar 04 20:12:40 <monr0e>	tar --ignore-failed-read -cvzf control.tar.xz md5sums control
Mar 04 20:12:41 <monr0e>	then
Mar 04 20:12:50 <monr0e>	r rcs cairo-dock-impulse-plug-in_3.4.1+git20201022.a0d3415c-1+b1_amd64.deb debian-binary control.tar.xz data.tar.xz debian-binary
Mar 04 20:13:02 <monr0e>	oh I stuck that in twice
Mar 04 20:13:07 <monr0e>	hmm
Mar 04 20:13:16 <ayecee>	ok, use -cvf instead of -czvf
Mar 04 20:13:32 <ayecee>	the -z is telling it to use gzip compression explicitly, though the extension doesn't match.
Mar 04 20:13:32 <monr0e>	roger dodger
Mar 04 20:13:46 <monr0e>	oh, right. I have no idea about compression from cli
Mar 04 20:15:10 <nhartman>	I'm trying to read from a physical memory address. I open /dev/mem, mmap it, and then try read from the returned VA. However I immediately segfault. How/why would this be the case after I have mmapped the address
Mar 04 20:15:21 <monr0e>	ayecee: same issue
Mar 04 20:17:00 <ayecee>	what are your two commands now?
Mar 04 20:17:11 <eyeris>	so when a dbus config has an '<policy context="default"><allow own="a.b.c" /></policy>' how does that determine what can own a.b.c? Does it mean _any_ process can own that name?
Mar 04 20:17:29 <monr0e>	tar --ignore-failed-read -cf control.tar.xz md5sums control
Mar 04 20:17:30 <monr0e>	then
Mar 04 20:17:31 <monr0e>	ar rcs cairo-dock-impulse-plug-in_3.4.1+git20201022.a0d3415c-1+b1_amd64.deb debian-binary control.tar.xz data.tar.xz
Mar 04 20:17:37 <monr0e>	same with -cvf
Mar 04 20:17:57 <eyeris>	If it was '<policy user=x"><allow own="a.b.c" /></policy>' that would mean user 'x' could own a.b.c, right?
Mar 04 20:18:21 <ayecee>	monr0e: what's the output from "file control.tar.gz"?
Mar 04 20:18:38 <ayecee>	err. control.tar.xz
Mar 04 20:19:13 <monr0e>	ahah. Rather different to data.tar.xz
Mar 04 20:19:40 <monr0e>	https://paste.debian.net/1309453/
Mar 04 20:20:16 <ayecee>	nhartman: what flags do you use on your open() call?
Mar 04 20:20:39 <monr0e>	xz is also a command I have installed, but i'm not sure how to use it properly. I tried it earlier and couldn't figure out now to wrap up two files into a single tarball
Mar 04 20:20:45 <ayecee>	monr0e: weird. okay, try with -cavf
Mar 04 20:20:58 <ayecee>	which explicitly requests compression based on extension
Mar 04 20:21:42 <monr0e>	grrrr. that worked, but now I have to figure out circular dependencies
Mar 04 20:23:19 <monr0e>	oh bugger. So cairo-dock has just installed, but it did something to audio and I don't know what
Mar 04 20:23:51 <ayecee>	one hurdle down, n hurdles to go
Mar 04 20:24:16 <monr0e>	what the fuck
Mar 04 20:24:20 <monr0e>	it installed pulseaudio
Mar 04 20:24:26 <Khaytsus>	Please watch the language
Mar 04 20:24:35 <ayecee>	huh. how'd it do that?
Mar 04 20:24:43 <monr0e>	I literally havent a clue
Mar 04 20:25:52 <ayecee>	that was dpkg -i --force-depeds on the deb you created, then apt install cairo-dock, without other options?
Mar 04 20:26:31 <ayecee>	modulo my typos
Mar 04 20:27:13 <monr0e>	no force deps on the deb, I had everything else ready to go.
Mar 04 20:27:17 <monr0e>	oh man
Mar 04 20:27:20 <monr0e>	it removed pipewire
Mar 04 20:27:34 <monr0e>	and didnt ask me for confirmation
Mar 04 20:27:39 <ayecee>	huh.
Mar 04 20:27:51 <ayecee>	dpkg did?
Mar 04 20:27:55 <monr0e>	no, apt
Mar 04 20:28:09 <ayecee>	weird.
Mar 04 20:28:48 <monr0e>	well, now I have to go and fix this. Bet you any money its removed the 32 bit packages I had for winamp too
Mar 04 20:28:54 <Disconsented>	Evidently, pipewire is more magical than we've been led to believe
Mar 04 20:29:46 <Beladona>	Hi, I want to make backup of a drive. Full os. what should be the command? `dd if=/dev/SOURCE of=/dev/DESTINATION bs=? status=?
Mar 04 20:29:51 <ayecee>	we have meddled in the affairs of apt, and it has extracted its vengeance.
Mar 04 20:30:18 <Namarrgon>	Beladona: "cp /dev/SOURCE /dev/DESTINATION"
Mar 04 20:30:45 <ayecee>	bs=1M status=progress
Mar 04 20:31:03 <nhartman>	ayecee: O_RDWR, O_SYNC
Mar 04 20:31:28 <ayecee>	nhartman: okay, looks good. no further ideas here :(
Mar 04 20:33:02 <bombastick>	Beladona: you more than anyone need ChatGPT Plus in your life
Mar 04 20:33:06 <nhartman>	:( thanks anyway
Mar 04 20:33:30 <Beladona>	ayecee:  ok
Mar 04 20:33:53 <Beladona>	bombastick: ok
Mar 04 20:34:05 <bombastick>	I dont get how boomers like ayecee are so anti-GPT. It's literally Star Trek scifi tech in our hands rn
Mar 04 20:34:14 <bombastick>	it's what you've always dreamed of
Mar 04 20:34:34 <Elw3>	Not sure if trolling or legit dumb.
Mar 04 20:34:38 <Namarrgon>	it's a dumb llm and you're overselling its capabilities
Mar 04 20:34:39 <bombastick>	both
Mar 04 20:34:55 <ayecee>	i'm not against it. i'm against the future-fear topics that mentioning it brings up.
Mar 04 20:35:08 <kfrench_>	...if Majel Barret always gave wrong answers
Mar 04 20:35:10 <Disconsented>	LLM's are essentially that guy at the party who likes to use big words to sound smart
Mar 04 20:35:23 <Disconsented>	At the end of the day, its just pattern recognition
Mar 04 20:35:32 <ayecee>	so am i
Mar 04 20:35:39 <ayecee>	i am just pattern recognition
Mar 04 20:35:52 <ayecee>	with a squishy interface
Mar 04 20:35:55 <bombastick>	Disconsented: you realize you can just prompt "Be brief in your answers and use simple words" and it will do that? You can make it talk however you want. You can make it talk like a black guy from the ghetto.
Mar 04 20:36:05 *	Disconsented makes a woosh sound
Mar 04 20:36:22 <bombastick>	the default writing style is "corporate clean", which is unfortunate

Mar 05 07:39:50 *	Topic for #linux set by Khaytsus (Thu Aug  3 13:54:32 2023)
Mar 05 07:40:06 <mdogg>	Do you have Linux installed?
Mar 05 07:41:52 <cluelessperson>	mdogg   Yes,  I have debian installed and I have windows isos and qemu ready to run
Mar 05 07:41:56 <cluelessperson>	no desktop environment
Mar 05 07:43:03 <mdogg>	Well, there are a lot of different ways to install Windows 11 in a VM.  If I were you, I would look through some of these videos https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=linux+install+windows+11+kvm
Mar 05 07:43:18 <pwntips>	cluelessperson: are you passing through your primary gpu?
Mar 05 07:43:27 <mdogg>	None of them are going to be a 'one-size fits all' but it will get you started.
Mar 05 07:43:59 <cluelessperson>	pwntips   Let's start with,  how does the system even determine which graphics card is rendered to the laptop display?
Mar 05 07:44:06 <cluelessperson>	presumably you can switch them at will
Mar 05 07:44:15 <cluelessperson>	further, I don't wish to dedicate the graphics card to a single VM
Mar 05 07:44:23 <cluelessperson>	modern gpus support processing units or shares
Mar 05 07:45:46 <pwntips>	cluelessperson: I believe the X server or Wayland initializes the appropriate driver
Mar 05 07:46:04 <cluelessperson>	What does that mean?
Mar 05 07:46:22 <cluelessperson>	In a modern machine, you typically have a single HDMI output
Mar 05 07:46:28 <cluelessperson>	and multiple graphics cards.
Mar 05 07:46:41 <cluelessperson>	How is it chosen which graphic's card is output?
Mar 05 07:47:59 <pwntips>	cluelessperson: a driver in your operating system needs to tell the GPU hardware to start communicating with the screen
Mar 05 07:48:27 <cluelessperson>	pwntips   right, but ***how*** does it do that?
Mar 05 07:48:45 <another|>	by talking to the device?
Mar 05 07:48:49 <pwntips>	cluelessperson: how does the driver do it?
Mar 05 07:49:14 <cluelessperson>	another|   WHAT device?
Mar 05 07:49:25 <cluelessperson>	You have an HDMI output, or internal built in laptop screen.
Mar 05 07:49:33 <cluelessperson>	Each graphics card doesn't just "talk to the device"
Mar 05 07:49:46 <cluelessperson>	Something is flipping a switch somewhere
Mar 05 07:49:52 <cluelessperson>	What is that something, where is that something
Mar 05 07:49:54 <cluelessperson>	where is that switch?
Mar 05 07:50:06 <pwntips>	too metaphysical for me unfortunately
Mar 05 07:50:23 <cluelessperson>	linux ->intel-video,  nvidia-video  -> laptop_screen, hdmi
Mar 05 07:51:19 <another|>	cluelessperson: the effing graphics card
Mar 05 07:51:34 <mdogg>	I have boxes and they're all laptops.  I have an Fn+Fkey that I can use to either have the display go to the built-in laptop screen, if I hit Fn+Fkey it will mirror to both laptop and external display, or I hit it again and it just goes to external display.
Mar 05 07:52:11 <cluelessperson>	another|  We're in a linux channel, I'm not playing with tinker toys.   I need to know the technical terminology and involvements to rewire this.
Mar 05 07:53:12 <mdogg>	cluelessperson: I think we're confused as to what you're trying to accomplish.  I've never had anybody rewire anything to get QEMU/KVM working.
Mar 05 07:53:52 <ayecee>	cluelessperson: some modern gpus support that. does yours?
Mar 05 07:54:01 <puke>	are we trying to set up vfio/gpu passthrough/etc here
Mar 05 07:54:04 <cluelessperson>	mdogg   The goal at the moment is to merely start QEMU such that it outputs the guest's video directly to the laptop built in screen.
Mar 05 07:54:26 <mdogg>	As opposed to...?
Mar 05 07:54:26 <ayecee>	can't do that without passhtrough.
Mar 05 07:54:27 <cluelessperson>	puke   Possibly, at the moment I'm trying to understand and learn how it works.
Mar 05 07:54:44 <cluelessperson>	mdogg  As opposed to outputting video directly to an external screen
Mar 05 07:55:03 <puke>	ive heard of people doing something very similar elsewhere
Mar 05 07:55:14 <ayecee>	well there's a datapoint
Mar 05 07:56:11 <ayecee>	cluelessperson: there exist gpus that can be "shared". they are not found in laptops.
Mar 05 07:56:21 <puke>	something along the lines of when you start the vm xorg somehow gives up control of the gpu to the vm for passthrough
Mar 05 07:56:38 <ayecee>	nope, that's not a thing.
Mar 05 07:57:10 <cluelessperson>	In theory,  there's just a hardware/memory address/channel that you can disconnect linux/host from, and connect QEMU's VGA or display drive directly to.
Mar 05 07:57:28 <cluelessperson>	and let the guest manage the graphics card directly
Mar 05 07:57:40 <ayecee>	handwaves don't write code.
Mar 05 07:57:42 <puke>	either way there seems to be some sort of workaround people use for this when they dont have more than a single output
Mar 05 07:57:56 <ayecee>	the workaround is to not use passthrough.
Mar 05 07:58:04 <puke>	oh?
Mar 05 07:58:20 <citty>	iirc asus-linux has a way to do passthrough on at least the devices they support
Mar 05 08:03:10 <mdogg>	If I open my lid and select 'span' instead of 'mirror', I can move my VM over to my laptop screen and run Windows while Linux is running on my external monitor.
Mar 05 08:03:28 <cluelessperson>	https://krutavshah.github.io/GPU_Virtualization-Wiki/overview.html
Mar 05 08:03:48 <cluelessperson>	Some nvidia cards support vGPU
Mar 05 08:03:48 <ayecee>	cluelessperson: does your gpu support gpu virtualization?
Mar 05 08:03:59 <cluelessperson>	ayecee  Not sure, possibly, it's a laptop 4090
Mar 05 08:04:19 <ayecee>	i'm asking because they normally don't.
Mar 05 08:04:36 <ayecee>	you should probably find out first before you bang your head against this problem too much.
Mar 05 08:04:51 <cluelessperson>	ayecee  you always have good advice, thank you
Mar 05 08:07:16 <ayecee>	you can see in the list that teslas and quadros would be the kind supported.
Mar 05 08:08:19 <puke>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Passing_the_boot_GPU_to_the_guest unsure if this is what i was thinking of
Mar 05 08:08:22 <ayecee>	data center gpus, pretty much.
Mar 05 08:08:23 <puke>	theres no special xorg related black magic which makes a lot more sense
Mar 05 08:09:35 <ayecee>	this one still requires a second gpu.
Mar 05 08:09:36 <cluelessperson>	ayecee  yeah, I don't see evidence that this particular gpu is supported.
Mar 05 08:09:59 <cluelessperson>	ayecee  my laptop has an embedded and discrete, so it might be still something I can live with.
Mar 05 08:10:00 <Artfaith>	I have always seen Quadros as GPUs for graphics artists and specific mathematical computations with hardware implemented math you would not find in more common GPUs.
Mar 05 08:10:56 <ayecee>	cluelessperson: i don't think they can run independently.
Mar 05 08:11:33 <cluelessperson>	ayecee  I'm probably doomed to run evil windows as my laptop host OS then
Mar 05 08:11:38 <cluelessperson>	I hate windows so much
Mar 05 08:11:43 <cluelessperson>	I hate microsoft.
Mar 05 08:11:44 <Artfaith>	So, I am no sure some are specifically for data canters but for local machines and software like AutoCad or 3dsMax which know how to even work with those.
Mar 05 08:11:49 <ayecee>	it' s a hard life
Mar 05 08:12:01 <Artfaith>	cluelessperson, sad life you have.
Mar 05 08:12:11 <ayecee>	Artfaith: come on
Mar 05 08:12:44 <cluelessperson>	Artfaith   Yes, actually, a monopolized market where microsoft injects tracking, telemetry, and malware into every single corner of your life is actually very very sad and destructive for all of us.
Mar 05 08:12:45 <Artfaith>	Everything has its purpose. Hatred has it too. It starts wars and cause sorrow.
Mar 05 08:13:05 <ayecee>	okay you poets, break it up.
Mar 05 08:13:16 <Artfaith>	cluelessperson, anything new?
Mar 05 08:14:10 <Artfaith>	ayecee, roger that. I won't continue this subject now.
Mar 05 08:14:37 *	cluelessperson cries and installs windows
Mar 05 08:14:52 <puke>	:(
Mar 05 08:15:22 <puke>	windows is a pain in the ass even when youre vm'ing it (looking glass my beloved)
Mar 05 08:17:12 <puke>	if LG ever gets support for linux guests working i might just make a linux gaming vm lol
Mar 05 08:18:27 <Fyr>	Hello. I need to compare text files to check if the contain identical information. The files are different in whitespaces. Is there a tool for that?
Mar 05 08:19:04 <Artfaith>	Fyr, have you tried `diff`? `e.g. diff -- ./file1 ./file2;`. More in `man diff`.
Mar 05 08:19:52 <Artfaith>	Though, sure there rare. Yet, what kind of such you want? A pure CLI, TUI, or GUI variant? With support from a vendor or purely Community oriented?
Mar 05 08:20:06 <Fyr>	CLI
Mar 05 08:20:20 <puke>	diff <(tr -s '[:space:]' '\n' < file1) <(tr -s '[:space:]' '\n' < file2)
Mar 05 08:20:21 <Artfaith>	`diff` is surely used in the most.
Mar 05 08:20:22 <puke>	something like this maybe?
Mar 05 08:20:45 <puke>	turns all of the whitespaces into lines and runs diff ^
Mar 05 08:21:01 <Artfaith>	puke, cannot diff see the different without manipulations?
Mar 05 08:21:17 <Fyr>	puke, I've run your command, there were no output. does it mean that they are identical?
Mar 05 08:21:24 <Fyr>	they are supposed to be identical.
Mar 05 08:21:44 <mdogg>	Try it with two known different files so you can see the output.
Mar 05 08:22:05 <Artfaith>	Fyr, have you ran?: `diff -- ./file1 ./file2`?`
Mar 05 08:22:21 <Fyr>	Artfaith, yes, I've got a lot of output.
Mar 05 08:22:37 <cappy>	Fyr: cmp(1) will certainly verify that they are identical, byte for byte, binary or otherwise.
Mar 05 08:22:38 <AndyCap>	Fyr: are you saying you want to ignore whitespace or show files that have different whitespace?
Mar 05 08:22:42 <mdogg>	I was going to suggest 'diff --ignore-all-space file1.txt file2.txt'
Mar 05 08:22:46 <Fyr>	indeed, the files contain identical information, but spaces somewhere are different.
Mar 05 08:22:57 <Fyr>	AndyCap, yes.
Mar 05 08:23:10 <Fyr>	puke has already provided the necessary command.
Mar 05 08:23:15 <Fyr>	Thank you.
Mar 05 08:23:26 <mdogg>	Oh nice.
Mar 05 08:23:49 <Artfaith>	FLHerne, do you see the same out put with `diff` option '--ignore-all-space'?
Mar 05 08:24:01 <Artfaith>	...
Mar 05 08:25:37 <puke>	tr -s '[:space:]' '\n' < file1 > file1.squeezed
Mar 05 08:25:41 <puke>	tr -s '[:space:]' '\n' < file2 > file2.squeezed
Mar 05 08:25:54 <puke>	Fyr: you might also want to check the resulting "squeezed" files manually
Mar 05 08:26:07 <mdogg>	He took off.
Mar 05 08:26:10 <puke>	oh
Mar 05 08:26:17 <louipc>	do that on a python script :D
Mar 05 08:26:55 <Artfaith>	You have `diff` just for it... The old and gold program with different algorithms and options. Why do you want to invent the so well and old wheel...?
Mar 05 08:27:43 <johnjaye>	does anybody remember that story about companies and people 'withdrawing' their linux kernel code?
Mar 05 08:28:07 <johnjaye>	i don't see how that could work. if you submitted code under the gpl then it's under the gpl. anybody can use it i thought
Mar 05 08:28:45 <Artfaith>	Not to mention the speed of well optimized special program and anything similar in Python.
Mar 05 08:28:56 <louipc>	they can't do anything about the old public code
Mar 05 08:29:23 <johnjaye>	that's what i thought. it doesn't seem too hard to imagine a scenario where intel redhat and a few other companies just "take over"  linux dev
Mar 05 08:29:29 <louipc>	johnjaye: they can make all future patches private with side agreements with whoever they deal with
Mar 05 08:29:33 <Artfaith>	Kernel is not old.
Mar 05 08:29:41 <puke>	Artfaith: i didnt know about --ignore-all-space but i figured collapsing everything into lines would probably give decent output
Mar 05 08:29:42 <Artfaith>	It is being developed every single day.
Mar 05 08:29:47 <johnjaye>	right. and you're stuck with the kernel from right now
Mar 05 08:29:56 <louipc>	johnjaye: kinda like what grsec did
Mar 05 08:30:20 <louipc>	grsec customers who are caught leaking code would be blacklisted
Mar 05 08:30:38 <johnjaye>	i'm not familiar with the lore. did they do something with selinux and debian?
Mar 05 08:31:27 <louipc>	not that i know. they just stopped making public release of grsec
Mar 05 08:31:47 <johnjaye>	i guess what i'm saying is i don't really see how linux people could prevent that
Mar 05 08:32:12 <johnjaye>	if there was some 'civil war' and a few companies decided to band together and take it
Mar 05 08:32:35 <johnjaye>	systemd for example alone is just a few people at one company
Mar 05 08:32:47 <Artfaith>	Prevent what? You have the source code everywhere. You can see the history of changes, and compile it manually comparing the two if required.
Mar 05 08:32:51 <louipc>	people who valued grsec decided to abide by their requests
Mar 05 08:33:22 <Artfaith>	johnjaye, what kind of issue do you mean? Noticing someone leaking malware into the public source code?
Mar 05 08:33:49 <Artfaith>	This is a well known issue and there are people who watch for it.
Mar 05 08:34:25 <Artfaith>	e.g. https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/clarifications-hc.pdf
Mar 05 08:34:31 <johnjaye>	not really. i mean if suddenly redhat intel and a few other companies withdrew their support
Mar 05 08:35:01 <puke>	hasn't something like this happened in the past
Mar 05 08:35:06 <puke>	not to linux obviously
Mar 05 08:35:07 <johnjaye>	and started to develop their own linux. The Gang of 4 Linux say.
Mar 05 08:35:17 <louipc>	you could use linux code internally with all your own private changes
Mar 05 08:35:17 <Artfaith>	johnjaye, please check the above document.
Mar 05 08:35:23 <deegan>	Maybe you are thinking of the SCO Linux thing puke ?
Mar 05 08:35:24 <johnjaye>	those companies also make the hardware.
Mar 05 08:35:26 <louipc>	and never distribute the builds
Mar 05 08:35:34 <louipc>	then you don't need to worry about gpl
Mar 05 08:36:22 <puke>	SCO never really had a hold on linux i dont think
Mar 05 08:37:16 <louipc>	sco is a bit of a different, complicated manner
Mar 05 08:37:47 <johnjaye>	right. i'm talking about a more hard to combat scenario where actually productive companies that contribute to the kernel decide to leave
Mar 05 08:37:52 <louipc>	but yea if someone contributed code they didn't have rights to then it may have to be removed
Mar 05 08:37:55 <Norkle>	:]
Mar 05 08:37:59 <johnjaye>	SCO was just trying to glom onto other people's work
Mar 05 08:38:23 <louipc>	might get complicated having to scrub all repo history and stuff
Mar 05 08:38:28 <deegan>	All the code is under GPL though, so if you contributed then it's a part of that license as well.
Mar 05 08:38:33 <deegan>	You can't go back on that.
Mar 05 08:38:42 <johnjaye>	right. the concern would be future code and future hardware
Mar 05 08:38:47 <louipc>	deegan: you can if you illegally submitted copyrighted code
Mar 05 08:38:50 <johnjaye>	what good does linux kernel 2020 do you if it's 2030?
Mar 05 08:39:13 <Artfaith>	What is good, johnjaye?
Mar 05 08:39:19 <louipc>	beats me. but its still a legal matter
Mar 05 08:39:23 <Artfaith>	"Good" depends on person and environment I believe.
Mar 05 08:39:28 <louipc>	might have no practical value
Mar 05 08:39:32 <puke>	yank that lan cable out and youre all good
Mar 05 08:44:05 <lakitu>	re https://linuxiac.com/linux-crosses-four-percent-market-share-worldwide/ : *moving the needle!*
Mar 05 08:45:20 <lakitu>	(((*misprint: re https://linuxiac.com/linux-crosses-four-percent-market-share-worldwide/ : *moving the needle!*!**
Mar 05 08:46:29 <Artfaith>	lakitu, are you aware how those data is collected? Are you sure every single server and even desktop common distro has built-in telemetry which constantly reports the usage to those "market share" click-baits?
Mar 05 08:46:52 <lakitu>	this is desktop usage
Mar 05 08:47:06 <lakitu>	for OSes
Mar 05 08:47:25 <puke>	there's also the browser user agent string right
Mar 05 08:47:26 <lakitu>	((((* this is desktop us*e*))))
Mar 05 08:47:47 <Artfaith>	Desktop who? Again, do you have your "desktop" sharing everyone you use specifically it? Do you know what kind of telemetry is enabled in your desktop?
Mar 05 08:48:21 *	lakitu re-reads a few times
Mar 05 08:48:32 <mdogg>	W3Techs has some interesting statistics.  https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/operating_system
Mar 05 08:48:35 <Artfaith>	puke, an how many requests is being sent by Linux servers out there? User agents are normally not considered.
Mar 05 08:48:40 <lakitu>	thanks (mdogg)
Mar 05 08:49:14 <Artfaith>	lakitu, I'll rephrase. Do you have telemetry enabled in your Linux "desktop"?
Mar 05 08:49:24 <Artfaith>	What kind of telemetry is it?
Mar 05 08:49:38 <Artfaith>	Where does it report it?
Mar 05 08:49:46 <Artfaith>	it to*
Mar 05 08:51:05 <puke>	you'd still get a decent estimate with just user agents though i think
Mar 05 08:51:47 <puke>	i dont recall ever mentioning linux servers
Mar 05 08:52:12 <lakitu>	I remember when Linux desktop use was 1 to 2% . . .  was maybe 2017 . . .
Mar 05 08:52:23 <Artfaith>	Why would you use your user agent? Are you aware you can change it within 1 second and put there anything literally? It comes from request headers...
Mar 05 08:52:38 <Artfaith>	lakitu, I don't understand... do you read?
Mar 05 08:52:52 <Artfaith>	Why do you compare statistics based on literally NO DATA?
Mar 05 08:53:04 <Artfaith>	There's literally no freaking telemetry in the most Linux environments.
Mar 05 08:53:08 <puke>	not like that's something most people do right
Mar 05 08:53:32 <puke>	i only ever do that to test or workaround dumb web stuff lol
Mar 05 08:53:51 <Artfaith>	I have no such telemetry enabled at all. I monitor my traffic, since it's related to what I do for living, and heck I've tried various "desktop" Linux. Do you have telemetry enabled, again?
Mar 05 08:54:13 <lakitu>	they can get the stats somehow or another
Mar 05 08:54:15 <Artfaith>	puke, you would be surprised.
Mar 05 08:54:40 <Artfaith>	lakitu, who? What stats? How? What is the other? What is the at least one?
Mar 05 08:55:13 <mdogg>	I would be surprised if telemetry was enabled by default in any Linux distro.  I know web browsers enable it by default but I'd be surprised if it was something the a GNU/Linux OS did by default.
Mar 05 08:55:27 <Artfaith>	Thank you, mdogg.
Mar 05 08:55:36 <Artfaith>	Sure there not, and sure there won't.
Mar 05 08:55:44 <puke>	i dont know any distro that does that either other than maybe ubuntu
Mar 05 08:56:06 <Artfaith>	Why do you guess and not check?
Mar 05 08:56:39 <puke>	i dont care enough to
Mar 05 08:56:51 <puke>	well
Mar 05 08:57:04 <Artfaith>	e.g. https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-report
Mar 05 08:57:08 <puke>	i know my own setup has no spooky telemetry
Mar 05 08:57:12 <puke>	thats all that matters
Mar 05 08:57:50 <mdogg>	I do remember notices when an application crashed that asked me whether I was interested in having information about the crash reported.  I don't recall which distro I was in, though.
Mar 05 08:58:05 <mdogg>	But I remember it asking each time with the option to never ask again.
Mar 05 08:58:25 <puke>	feels like something kde would have
Mar 05 08:58:30 <mdogg>	Then again, that may not have been a question the OS asked - it could have been the application that asked.
Mar 05 08:58:42 <Aleshka>	SPAAAAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mar 05 08:59:05 <puke>	where
Mar 05 08:59:08 <puke>	are you the spam?
Mar 05 08:59:17 <Artfaith>	e.g. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2018-February/040145.html
Mar 05 08:59:31 <Artfaith>	> I don't believe that sending data by default is 'a thing that matters
Mar 05 08:59:33 <Artfaith>	most to our users'. Quite the opposite in fact. MS was/is getting a lot
Mar 05 08:59:35 <Artfaith>	of heat for their data collection and we shouldn't go down that very
Mar 05 08:59:37 <Artfaith>	same route by making data gathering the default.
Mar 05 08:59:46 <Artfaith>	- On behalf of the Ubuntu Desktop Team
Mar 05 09:00:12 <pwntips>	mdogg: Kubuntu definitely had that
Mar 05 09:00:30 <Artfaith>	puke, I don't have that in KDE Neon.
Mar 05 09:01:08 <puke>	i havent used kde in ages
Mar 05 09:01:29 <deegan>	Another reason to keep running Slackware everywhere. Just kidding, run whatever you want. But telemetry has been normalised for so long. And people in general tend to reason that "it doesn't bother me", which I don't agree with. But each to his or her own.
Mar 05 09:01:30 <Artfaith>	> application telemetry is always opt-in. That means off by default and only activated by the explicit action of the user (inaction is not good enough).
Mar 05 09:01:34 <Artfaith>	Source: https://community.kde.org/Policies/Telemetry_Policy
Mar 05 09:02:01 <Artfaith>	pwntips, where is the source?
Mar 05 09:02:17 <mdogg>	deegan: For some reason, people have been trending towards convenience over privacy for a while now.
Mar 05 09:03:37 <puke>	its good most foss software is still leaning towards opt-in at least
Mar 05 09:03:48 <deegan>	mdogg: oh yea absolutely. They freak out if you take a picture and they happen to be in it, just for being in the same area as you. but the fact that if you say "boat boat boat boat, i want to buy a boat" and then open up google on your phone and type "b" the first word to complete will be "buy boat" doesn't bother them. or that Like/retweet buttons etc. track you everywhere. But no a random picture
Mar 05 09:03:50 <deegan>	taken by someone that wont fly. :D
Mar 05 09:03:56 <pwntips>	Artfaith: Just my experience of having KDE apps crash on Kubuntu and ask if I wanted to report it
Mar 05 09:04:24 <deegan>	telemetry tends to slip from "so we can collect crash info" to "usage info" real fast.
Mar 05 09:05:03 <puke>	kde did crash a lot back when i was still on it
Mar 05 09:05:23 <puke>	not to the point of being unusable
Mar 05 09:05:32 <Artfaith>	pwntips, of course it will. This is how Apport operates specifically. How is it supposed to be bad?
Mar 05 09:05:32 <puke>	but still frustrating
Mar 05 09:06:04 <mdogg>	deegan: Yeah.  "Don't take a photo of me where I'm 50 meters away and out-of-focus, but I do have the app for my favorite taco place installed which provides them with all websites I visit, my names and numbers from my address book, and real-time location information"
Mar 05 09:06:12 <puke>	so kde does have a crash reporter
Mar 05 09:06:14 <pwntips>	Artfaith: it wasn't bad for my user experience, I turned it off
Mar 05 09:06:26 <deegan>	mdogg: it's absurd isn't it. :D
Mar 05 09:06:28 <Artfaith>	Most Ubuntu official implementations has `core dump` configured for this Apport specifically. This is how it's done and can be disabled by one command, and not to mention that it's opt-in, again.
Mar 05 09:06:55 <Artfaith>	pwntips, how is it related to the mention issue about "automatical" and implicit telemetry?
Mar 05 09:07:07 <Artfaith>	mentioned*
Mar 05 09:07:31 <pwntips>	Artfaith: i must have missed that context, my apologies
Mar 05 09:07:42 <Artfaith>	It's a whole blown modal/alert window which explicitly asks your authorization to share the data in the hope to fix a bug!
Mar 05 09:07:59 <Artfaith>	And you tell, being it turned off, this is bad?
Mar 05 09:08:11 <Artfaith>	Should you program just crash and care less about it?
Mar 05 09:08:21 <mdogg>	You can file the bug yourself if you want.
Mar 05 09:08:22 <Artfaith>	your*
Mar 05 09:08:33 <Artfaith>	mdogg, and this is why this Apport exists in the first place.
Mar 05 09:08:41 <Artfaith>	Some people just have no idea how to report those issues.
Mar 05 09:08:54 <mdogg>	Or what information to include.
Mar 05 09:09:32 <Artfaith>	And that Apport surely describes what data it includes and tells what you can do about it.
Mar 05 09:11:09 <h3y>	what irc client is everyone using?
Mar 05 09:11:20 <mdogg>	HexChat is pretty popular.
Mar 05 09:11:34 <Artfaith>	Weechat here.
Mar 05 09:11:51 <citty>	Quassel, with the server on a 24/7 host
Mar 05 09:12:12 <deegan>	I used to be a epic4+lice user, but I have Weechat for I don't know how many years.
Mar 05 09:12:18 <mlu>	h3y: I'm using irssi
Mar 05 09:12:46 <h3y>	this is my first time using irc so i was just curious, i'm usinging tiny
Mar 05 09:12:55 <Artfaith>	If you can strace, gdb, and dump your core manually, reproducing the issue whilst debugging with your free time, sure! Go ahead, Hacker! In the real world, if you see a person who tries to live and work, they may not be so professional in anything software development and debugging, and I would rather see them clicking "send" button with the data prior reviewed and checked what I can included
Mar 05 09:12:57 <Artfaith>	additionally if required.
Mar 05 09:13:11 <citty>	Have seen a suprising amount of people use Thunderbird
Mar 05 09:13:51 <pwntips>	h3y: weechat
Mar 05 09:14:23 <mlu>	h3y: welcome to the club
Mar 05 09:14:28 <h3y>	interesting, i didn't know you could use thunderbird for anything but email
Mar 05 09:14:29 <mlu>	h3y: by the way, IRC's been dead for more than 20yr :P
Mar 05 09:14:35 <mdogg>	h3y: I've never used Tiny but I reckon any proper IRC client like that, or the ones people mentioned above, are better than using a web client.  You'll have a much better experience with IRC if you use a proper client rather than something that runs in a tab on your web browser.
Mar 05 09:15:55 <Artfaith>	So, I have no idea how Apport or similar opt-in and sure configurable options is bad being enabled by default in the most major environments like Ubuntu Desktop. Disable for core dump? 1 command, change: `kernel.core_pattern` in sysctl.
Mar 05 09:16:31 <Artfaith>	puke, for example, https://dev.aseprite.org/2016/09/01/new-source-code-license/
Mar 05 09:16:53 <Artfaith>	> The worst Linux issue are crash reports. I think that Linux distributions should have an automatic mechanism to save/show crash reports (a la OS X), or share those crash reports automatically with the application developer. (In this case I think Ubuntu Apport and whoopsie are making the best effort.)
Mar 05 09:16:57 <Artfaith>	> From my point of view it’s happening a complete inverse process: Windows memory dumps and OS X crash reports are useful to detect bugs that then will benefit Linux users.
Mar 05 09:17:16 <puke>	whats that in response to
Mar 05 09:17:58 <Artfaith>	So, in other words, while I would not accept telemetry enabled by default, too, I still see why it is enabled by default in certain cases. It helps business too much to not be, and if you are in business, you would understand it, too.
Mar 05 09:19:42 <lakitu>	+1% (Linux desktop use) in eight months!
Mar 05 09:19:49 <Artfaith>	...
Mar 05 09:19:51 <Artfaith>	Freaking troll.
Mar 05 09:19:56 <lakitu>	ha
Mar 05 09:19:58 <louipc>	wat
Mar 05 09:20:00 <militantorc>	lakitu, every time a new win or mac released
Mar 05 09:20:04 <militantorc>	i bet you will se spike in graph
Mar 05 09:20:21 <lakitu>	mirror accusation (by ArtFaith)
Mar 05 09:20:29 <lakitu>	- continuing: that article says
Mar 05 09:20:33 <Artfaith>	I see now, lakitu. Thank you for the "ha" and finally leaving me be.
Mar 05 09:20:35 <puke>	people who care about this stuff usually also go out of their way to turn it off (though its another thing to make the processes involved obnoxiously difficult)
Mar 05 09:20:39 <Artfaith>	This was a good long run from you.
Mar 05 09:20:49 <lakitu>	I wonder whether that could keep that pace
Mar 05 09:20:50 <Disconsented>	Kids, settle down
Mar 05 09:20:57 <Artfaith>	I should consider my time now.
Mar 05 09:21:02 <militantorc>	puke, there comes a point when you realize you are spending 90% time fighting your computer
Mar 05 09:21:28 <puke>	thats why i stopped using windows yea
Mar 05 09:21:53 <Artfaith>	I did not fight computer with Windows, but with MacOS I did.
Mar 05 09:22:29 <lakitu>	in 2 years (24 months) we could be at 7% - **could be**
Mar 05 09:22:32 <puke>	my computer has been very well behaving the past few years
Mar 05 09:22:32 <Artfaith>	MacOS must be marvelous for someone, and I see how it can be, but... not my cup of tea, indeed. And two weeks were enough.
Mar 05 09:22:55 <Artfaith>	Disconsented, you see it, right?
Mar 05 09:23:03 <puke>	to the point where i no longer feel the desire to make improvements
Mar 05 09:23:16 <Disconsented>	I see optimism rather than trolling
Mar 05 09:23:45 *	puke thinks lakitu is trolling
Mar 05 09:23:55 <Artfaith>	Baseless, foundationless, inexperienced optimism invented to tickle people in chats.
Mar 05 09:23:59 <Artfaith>	This is how I see it.
Mar 05 09:24:00 <lakitu>	very funny.
Mar 05 09:24:14 <lakitu>	posting a positive news article for Linux in #linux
Mar 05 09:24:19 <Disconsented>	Well, if they're actually trolling, they've achieved their goals in getting a rise out of folks
Mar 05 09:24:41 <Artfaith>	They did not research anything about this subject, and are basing their "optimism" on unknown foundations and lack of any normal evidence.
Mar 05 09:24:50 <Artfaith>	This is not optimism. This madness.
Mar 05 09:24:54 <Artfaith>	is*

Mar 05 09:33:30 <h3y>	i think i would get yelled at if i commited a function that looked like Q_rsqrt lol
Mar 05 09:34:15 <militantorc>	h3y, maybe today
Mar 05 09:34:49 <militantorc>	in the 90s most probably the IT market was more optimization focused it manpower is cheaper than newer hardware
Mar 05 09:36:09 <h3y>	militantorc: oh yeah for sure, no one cares now bc its just shoved into nodejs and we call it a day
Mar 05 09:36:28 <mdogg>	because ^
Mar 05 09:36:33 <xiaomiao>	militantorc: manpower is still pretty cheap
Mar 05 09:37:01 <livingbeef>	Competent manpower isn't.
Mar 05 09:37:04 <xiaomiao>	but somehow people got used to spending 20x more on Cloud
Mar 05 09:37:21 <xiaomiao>	livingbeef: oh, they are cheap. single person outperforming a team at half the team salary? still totally worth it
Mar 05 09:37:43 <Artfaith>	xiaomiao, what people?
Mar 05 09:37:45 <xiaomiao>	my usual calculation is that after ~3 months the savings from having me exceed my salary, so I'm still pretty darn cheap
Mar 05 09:37:59 <Artfaith>	I don't know anyone who is. Literally, no one I know.
Mar 05 09:38:03 <xiaomiao>	Artfaith: competent people - they are force multipliers, so paying them 5x "market rate" is still cheap
Mar 05 09:38:25 <livingbeef>	only happens if you're lucky, it's hard to find those people and even harder to convince them to changes jobs
Mar 05 09:38:42 <Artfaith>	xiaomiao, you seem to be comparing some special cases.
Mar 05 09:38:50 <xiaomiao>	livingbeef: not hard to find, but they are usually opinionated and not interested in hierarchy / political games
Mar 05 09:38:53 <lakitu>	competent derives from "compete" - maybe around a minimal 50% ability level on one denotation
Mar 05 09:39:05 <Artfaith>	Are you about servers and outsourced computation or general usage?
Mar 05 09:39:15 <Artfaith>	By general, I mean, Office 360 for example.
Mar 05 09:39:24 <xiaomiao>	*shudder*
Mar 05 09:39:27 <xiaomiao>	the horror!
Mar 05 09:39:29 <lakitu>	quite a few people don't connect those terms
Mar 05 09:39:40 <militantorc>	i would say its still done today
Mar 05 09:39:55 <Artfaith>	Everyone I know uses their local office copies. The same for graphics and video-games even.
Mar 05 09:40:01 <militantorc>	in areas where it is clearly seen problems are compute costly enough
Mar 05 09:40:09 <militantorc>	and if you can't just pass on costs to your users
Mar 05 09:40:11 <Lantizia>	i'm familiar with using the ssh/scp/sftp commands to send files or issue commands as 'one-liners' ... i.e. non-interactively.
Mar 05 09:40:18 <Artfaith>	No one I know uses cloud except for server machinery.
Mar 05 09:40:23 <Lantizia>	does anyone know how I can send files with sftp and issue commands in the one line?
Mar 05 09:40:43 <Artfaith>	Lantizia, just in case, have you considered RClone?
Mar 05 09:41:05 <Artfaith>	i.e. https://rclone.org/#what
Mar 05 09:41:08 <Lantizia>	I've used it before yeah
Mar 05 09:41:16 <Lantizia>	not sure how rclone fits here? that's just about files
Mar 05 09:41:29 <Artfaith>	How is Rclone not about files?
Mar 05 09:42:04 <Lantizia>	I don't feel like you're making much sense :P
Mar 05 09:42:08 <Artfaith>	...
Mar 05 09:42:26 <Artfaith>	You question does little sense too then.
Mar 05 09:42:32 <Lantizia>	I'm looking for a way to combine the tasks of issuing remote commands (unrelated to file operations) and send files... in the same command
Mar 05 09:42:36 <Artfaith>	Your question*
Mar 05 09:43:17 <Lantizia>	I think sftp might be my best bet if I can somehow figure out how to get in/out of sftp "mode" somehow?
Mar 05 09:43:39 <Artfaith>	SFTP is being done in the same SSH session.
Mar 05 09:43:48 <Artfaith>	Normally. 1 connection.
Mar 05 09:43:48 <Lantizia>	exactly so the ssh session is already there
Mar 05 09:44:12 <Lantizia>	e.g. i want to send a file, run some commands, send another file, run more commands... all in the 1 connection - non-interactively
Mar 05 09:44:14 <Artfaith>	Though, it means, you may have speed issues and bottlenecks.
Mar 05 09:44:36 <Artfaith>	So, SSH then, would be the most common option.
Mar 05 09:45:36 <Artfaith>	You would connect to SSH, and connect SFTP client to the same session locally
Mar 05 09:46:00 <Artfaith>	You would have shell and file transferring in the same connection.
Mar 05 09:46:30 <Artfaith>	+ port forwarding, tunnelling, X11, anything else. It's what SSH was designed for.
Mar 05 09:47:11 <Artfaith>	Lantizia, e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/a/440546/5113030
Mar 05 09:48:42 <Artfaith>	e.g. https://docs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/using-ssh-controlmaster-for-single-sign-on/
Mar 05 09:49:07 <Artfaith>	> OpenSSH has an option called ControlMaster that enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single network connection. This means that you can connect to the cluster once, enter your password and verification code, and have all other subsequent ssh sessions (including svn, rsync, etc. that run over ssh) piggy-back off the initial connection without need for re-authentication.
Mar 05 09:49:43 <mi6x3m>	hey, does anyone know typical device files to read the fan speed from?
Mar 05 09:50:06 <mlu>	mi6x3m: look at lmsensors
Mar 05 09:50:08 <xiaomiao>	mi6x3m: it depends, so using e.g. lm_sensors is often the easiest way
Mar 05 09:50:33 <mi6x3m>	i don't want to run execisve lm sensors and i dont change hardware often, hence the file requirement
Mar 05 09:51:03 <Artfaith>	mi6x3m, what is the hardware/model?
Mar 05 09:51:10 <mi6x3m>	T450s
Mar 05 09:51:59 <Artfaith>	mi6x3m, https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Thinkpad-acpi
Mar 05 09:52:59 <mi6x3m>	WOW Artfaith, thank you so much!!
Mar 05 09:55:43 <Lantizia>	well as far as I can tell neither of those links mean it's the same command... more that you background an ssh connection and reuse it
Mar 05 09:55:47 <Artfaith>	It may be disabled by default in your environment but exist in your Kernel already, too: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.txt
Mar 05 09:56:18 <Artfaith>	Lantizia, just to clarify, how a single command can do separate logic?
Mar 05 09:56:53 <Artfaith>	I mean, how a machine can understand with word "A" do "B" and "C" without you specifically telling it about it?
Mar 05 09:56:58 <Lantizia>	I'm not saying it can... but I'm musing if it can :P  I swear I've seen something and I'm trying to dig it out
Mar 05 09:57:10 <Artfaith>	Please provide an example of the command then.
Mar 05 09:57:15 <Artfaith>	How you do see it.
Mar 05 09:57:44 <Lantizia>	aha found it...
Mar 05 09:58:01 <Lantizia>	you can use an exclamation mark in sftp I think to run native commands
Mar 05 09:58:11 <Artfaith>	bash -c 'ssh a b && sftp c... && ssh d e;';?
Mar 05 09:58:13 <Lantizia>	or possibly that's just to swap between local and remote operations... checking
Mar 05 09:58:41 <Artfaith>	The above assume master/slave connection sure.
Mar 05 09:59:00 <Artfaith>	Lantizia, I believe you need a specific client or script for it.
Mar 05 09:59:11 <Artfaith>	SSH has built-in commands, too. For example, `~C`.
Mar 05 09:59:24 <Lantizia>	e.g. I just found a line in an old script...   sshpass -p $pwd sftp -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -s"sudo /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server" $usr@$hst:/etc <<<$'mkdir certificates\ncd certificates\nput cert.key privkey.pem\n!cat cert.pem ../GeoTrust_RSA_CA_2018.pem > fullchain.pem\nput fullchain.pem\n!rm fullchain.pem'
Mar 05 10:00:31 <Artfaith>	With SSH local client command `~^Z` you should be able to "Background ssh."
Mar 05 10:01:18 <Artfaith>	Else, if you need something more interactive, I believe you should search for specific client which operates on single connection.
Mar 05 10:03:13 <Artfaith>	e.g. for something visual, for example: https://github.com/subhra74/snowflake
Mar 05 10:03:31 <Artfaith>	I know a marvelous solution for Windows, though: https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client
Mar 05 10:03:46 <Artfaith>	I am not aware of anything same for Linux.
Mar 05 10:03:51 <Lantizia>	who is this aimed at now lol
Mar 05 10:04:14 <Artfaith>	I thought you want a convenient way to switch between SFTP and SSH?
Mar 05 10:04:28 <Artfaith>	Why not use a client which provides with both options?
Mar 05 10:04:39 <Artfaith>	Which is designed for it.
Mar 05 10:04:48 <Artfaith>	This is aimed for you?
Mar 05 10:05:45 <Lantizia>	it really isn't - you're now way off what I was asking about
Mar 05 10:05:47 <Artfaith>	Am I wasting time again? I am talking with you, investing my time, and instead of anything to help your case, you accused me TWO times I fail to understand you, instead of even a slight "thanks" or anything.
Mar 05 10:06:02 <Artfaith>	I mean, I am not requesting that, but it looks like you don't want to find solution for your case even.
Mar 05 10:06:15 <Artfaith>	You provide with 1% of anything useful to solve your issue.
Mar 05 10:06:23 <Artfaith>	You accuse ME I don't understand you.
Mar 05 10:06:32 <Artfaith>	A question is 50% of its solution.
Mar 05 10:06:40 <Artfaith>	Please consider investing effort to your problem, too.
Mar 05 10:07:12 <Lantizia>	yeah you can talk to yourself now... you're going on ignore - i mean, I'm happy you tried and all... but ultimately it just feels a little like you're googling and I can do that myself
Mar 05 11:21:37 <stwange>	I'm trying to run a MySQL backup script from docker but something is going wrong with the printing. I do for i in `docker exec -t mysql-slaves-test-slave-1 mysql -BNe 'SHOW DATABASES'`; do echo "${i}-Tuesday.sql"; done and I'm getting the Tuesday overwriting the DB name, eg: -Tuesdayion_schema instead of information_schema-Tuesday
Mar 05 11:28:00 <livingbeef>	Sounds like crappy shell imlementation. Use printf
Mar 05 11:32:06 <bolovanos>	Hithere - I have problem with my logrotate setup for samba. It piles up dates in names so it becomes unusable. After few rotations file names get bigger (log.192.168.0.105-20230806-20230813-20230820-20230827-20230903-20230910
Mar 05 11:32:06 <bolovanos>	). /etc/logrotate.d/samba -> https://paste.debian.net/hidden/024a6afc/
Mar 05 11:32:25 <hexnewbie>	I cannot imagine echo implementation that would do this, I'd go for mixing standard error and standard input, although even that doesn't account for this exactly (since that would mean empty stdout preventing the echo from running at all), at least it's *possible*
Mar 05 11:32:46 <hexnewbie>	So I guess unusual control characters in the output may be it
Mar 05 11:34:07 <lopid>	bolovanos, you need to check the path of the logs in the stanza. the man page specifically warns about matching already rotated log filenames
Mar 05 11:35:53 <hexnewbie>	I don't think the patterns of logrotate config can match that log file name format
Mar 05 11:36:36 <lopid>	i think line 23 does
Mar 05 11:38:01 <livingbeef>	hmm, you might be right, could be simple return character; something like tr -dc [:alnum:] could help
Mar 05 11:38:05 <hexnewbie>	Yeah, but it also matches log.192.168.0.105-20230806. You can't match log.192.168.0.105 with a glob but not log.192.168.0.105-20230806
Mar 05 11:39:06 <stwange>	livingbeef do i=`echo $i | perl -pe 's/\s//g'`; echo "${i}-Tuesday"; done removes the problem in an ugly way, so it must be some control character
Mar 05 11:39:18 <hexnewbie>	I mean, OK, maybe you can do it with three globs ....log.*.[0-9] ...log.*.[0-9][0-9] ...log.*.[0-9][0-9][0-9]
Mar 05 11:42:41 <katia>	https://linuxiac.com/linux-crosses-four-percent-market-share-worldwide/
Mar 05 11:42:46 <katia>	year of the linux desktop! it's happening!
Mar 05 11:44:05 <bolovanos>	lopid, hexnewbie, livingbeef - will look on that. Thank you
Mar 05 11:44:27 <neoncortex>	it seems to be exponential.  It was not 2% last year?
Mar 05 11:45:15 <fb`>	nice that's a 33% increase in one year
Mar 05 11:45:42 <lopid>	one could argue that year was whenever chromebooks were released
Mar 05 11:59:28 <bolovanos>	lopid, hexnewbie, livingbeef - why is it leaving those, already compressed logs there? Unlike other logrotate setups? Shouldn't it help to add something to through away such log instead of creating new one upon old one?
Mar 05 12:01:29 <circuitbone>	Do you really want everyone running a distro, you know mass adoption usually ruins things. wubuntu came out recently for the windows kids.
Mar 05 12:01:41 <bolovanos>	I should rather say. Why is it creating new file names instead of using only one
Mar 05 12:02:02 <lopid>	maybe because of delaycompress. by the time of the next rotation, it sees a "new" log file to rotate, rather than recognising it as previously rotated
Mar 05 12:02:18 <livingbeef>	^^ exactly, KDE is now removing one click default because of wintoddlers
Mar 05 12:02:41 <phogg>	but one click default was added to match the behavior of Windows!
Mar 05 12:03:02 <livingbeef>	??? when had windows ever had that behavior?
Mar 05 12:03:45 <lopid>	also, check that there're no global settings intefering
Mar 05 12:03:47 <livingbeef>	open / launch was 2 clicks was at least in win95
Mar 05 12:04:44 <phogg>	livingbeef: at the time KDE adopted it that was the default for Windows ME
Mar 05 12:05:06 <lopid>	you don't need to set that dateformat, btw. that format is already the default
Mar 05 12:06:37 <bolovanos>	lopid, I am wondering why is there that line 23 "/var/log/samba/*log.[!samba]*" at all, tempted to delete it
Mar 05 12:07:28 <lopid>	you can run debug and verbose mode to see what it would do
Mar 05 12:07:51 <phogg>	stwange: I'll bet you anything the text returned by mysql is delimited with \r\n. The most you should need to fix it is | tr -d '\r'
Mar 05 12:08:49 <lopid>	and if you want to run it against some file to test with, replace the time period (eg. weekly) with "size 1"
Mar 05 12:08:56 <lopid>	some files
Mar 05 12:09:26 <livingbeef>	interesting; I've even used win2k and never encountered this
Mar 05 12:10:03 <bolovanos>	lopid, thank you going to play with it :)
Mar 05 12:10:47 <lopid>	i coincidentally did it recently myself
Mar 05 12:13:59 <circuitbone>	the average joes mindset is, does it have more programs vs what they use now, regardless of quality, just the quantity value is prioritised as the key value.
Mar 05 12:16:29 <livingbeef>	remembering how linus did, I really do not want year of the linux desktop
Mar 05 12:16:57 <livingbeef>	linus, the american scammer that is
Mar 05 12:21:19 <circuitbone>	Who can corporations blame when it falls apart as well? The liability finger pointing falls over when company a can't yell at company b when it falls apart.
Mar 05 12:22:17 <livingbeef>	If you pay canonical for support, you can yell at canonical
Mar 05 12:23:16 <livingbeef>	RH as well, tho I'm not sure if they do non-server
Mar 05 12:23:45 <Guest49>	Hi all
Mar 05 12:23:45 <Guest49>	I have a Lenovo Thinkpad running Windoze 10 that I wanted to set up for dual boot but I am having problems setting the boot options as, although I change it in the BIOS to boot from the USB device, it just reverts back to the default setting.  Does anyone know a workaround for this?
Mar 05 12:23:46 <Guest49>	TIA
Mar 05 12:24:09 <circuitbone>	gotta yell at someone in that mindset.
Mar 05 12:24:11 <livingbeef>	set bios password
Mar 05 12:24:23 <livingbeef>	win is rewriting it, because no pass is set
Mar 05 12:24:32 <Guest49>	Okay how do I do that pls?
Mar 05 12:25:08 <livingbeef>	look it up
Mar 05 12:25:15 <adv8tor>	Lenovo tends to reset the boot order for the usb if it is removed. I need to set it manually each time I remove it
Mar 05 12:28:53 <peac>	thinkpads should also have an F key that goes directly to the boot list to choose one entry and boot once, instead of changing the boot order
Mar 05 12:30:20 <xiaomiao>	F12, usually
Mar 05 12:36:15 <Guest49>	F12 takes you into boot menu options but it only gives two options Windows Boot Manager or the HD
Mar 05 12:36:31 <hexnewbie>	bolovanos: It does not know whether a file in the directory is a log it compressed or not. All it does is match the name you gave it. One way to fix that is to place those rotated logs in a different directory, another way is to make the matching of the file very specific (though I think the three glob solution is the only way)
Mar 05 12:46:30 <peac>	Guest49 how did you flash your drive ? looks like it isn't bootable
Mar 05 12:48:10 <Guest49>	I'm just d/ling Ubuntu Studio and will try to make a bootable disk and see how that goes
Mar 05 12:48:57 <peac>	how did you flash your drive
Mar 05 12:49:03 <peac>	use etcher if unsure
Mar 05 12:49:48 <Guest49>	I haven't flashed it - didn't know I had to !
Mar 05 12:50:15 <peac>	if you just put the iso on the drive that clearly won't work
Mar 05 12:52:26 <Guest49>	Yes I know - I was going to use Unetbootin
Mar 05 12:53:20 <Guest49>	I was trying to install Ubuntu before but I'm going for US as I'm mostly going to be using the laptop for recording music
Mar 05 12:53:30 <Guest49>	Just waiting for it to arrive :)
Mar 05 12:54:44 <wantyapps>	Hallo!
Mar 05 12:58:14 <peac>	Guest49 which music software will you be using ?
Mar 05 12:58:57 <Guest49>	I'm using Ardour but still getting used to it so occasionally Audacity which I find a little more user friendly

Mar 05 13:10:05 <Artfaith>	Guest49, you might like! https://lunacy.audio/products/cube/
Mar 05 13:10:25 <Artfaith>	I would recommend, in addition to the above two.
Mar 05 13:11:12 <Artfaith>	It's priceless, https://lunacy.audio/products/cube/
Mar 05 13:11:22 <Artfaith>	err. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBEKBRosSN0
Mar 05 13:12:21 <Artfaith>	You can achieve something close with various tweaks on nobs, sure, but heck you would need quite of nobs and algos automated to achieve anything close enough.
Mar 05 13:13:35 <peac>	Artfaith the main issue will be your VST's compatibility with linux
Mar 05 13:13:53 <peac>	i'm using the Komplete suite and i can't install that on Linux unfortunately
Mar 05 13:14:21 <fairway>	if i want to run command   rename  all the files in D:\folder  to lowercase letters.  what is best to accomplish this
Mar 05 13:14:38 <Artfaith>	I have some Komplete, and what is the issue? Don't you have just libraries, or is it the installer what fails?
Mar 05 13:14:53 <Artfaith>	fairway, the path seems like Windows related.
Mar 05 13:14:53 <wigums>	fairway maybe ask in #windows
Mar 05 13:15:11 <fairway>	how do i do it in linux then
Mar 05 13:15:12 <Artfaith>	See escaped 'f'.
Mar 05 13:15:38 <Artfaith>	fairway, where is the path? Is it text or actual files on NTFS partition?
Mar 05 13:15:44 <fairway>	if i know how to do it in linux, then i can run linuxtools in windows
Mar 05 13:15:45 <peac>	Artfaith the installer comes for windows and macos, i did not try wine nor extracting the vsts manually
Mar 05 13:15:55 <fairway>	artfaith  just file-names
Mar 05 13:16:07 <Artfaith>	peac, I would try installing on Windows and copy/pasted the libs ^^"
Mar 05 13:16:20 <Artfaith>	Who knows how were those implemented...
Mar 05 13:16:25 <Artfaith>	It may work!
Mar 05 13:16:40 <peac>	Artfaith if you try it and have success i'd like to know !
Mar 05 13:17:01 <Guest49>	@Artfaith Thanks I'll check them out :)
Mar 05 13:18:09 <c9e>	why does xwayland apps have this weird scrolling behavior compared to pure wayland apps? particularly intellij and chrome
Mar 05 13:18:09 <bombastick>	("how big were those logs") ZLima12: far above 1MB. like 100MB (it's logging in debug). As I said invoking logrotate manually made them rotate. And it's running daily. It's just not rotating when it runs from the systemd service.
Mar 05 13:18:45 <fairway>	i just want to rename all file-names to lowercase
Mar 05 13:18:50 <fairway>	not inside the file
Mar 05 13:21:14 <Artfaith>	Guest49, just in case, the char "@" is not required on the most IRC clients.
Mar 05 13:21:49 <Guest49>	Artfaith okay thanks for the tip :)
Mar 05 13:25:15 <bombastick>	weechat seems to log all channels , I got a 100MB file for here, and yet I cant scroll up before yesterday. What's the deal with that?
Mar 05 13:25:28 <djph>	log != scrollback
Mar 05 13:25:46 <bombastick>	so desu ne
Mar 05 13:26:34 <bombastick>	any consequences to raising scrollback to monster amounts? like non-negligeable RAM usage? Or is it smart and just treats it like a basic text buffer the way efficient text editors doi?
Mar 05 13:27:07 <wyre>	hi guys, some idea why this could be happening? https://bpa.st/CX6A
Mar 05 13:27:43 <wyre>	can't see why all %MEM are 0.0 or 0.1 ... but still 23Gi are being used! 😲
Mar 05 13:27:53 <steering>	bombastick: why not both? :)
Mar 05 13:28:38 <livingbeef>	dunno, but could be cache
Mar 05 13:28:57 <wyre>	livingbeef, cache are just 774Mi
Mar 05 13:28:58 <Artfaith>	fairway, what if?: `find '/path' -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -execdir bash -c 'mv -vT -- "$1" "${1,,}";' - '{}' \;;`
Mar 05 13:29:00 <steering>	loading thousands of lines will have non-negligible RAM usage in an "efficient text editor" too. I'm sure you could raise it to some thousands without trouble though. Why not try it and see?
Mar 05 13:29:14 <livingbeef>	try echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
Mar 05 13:29:40 <livingbeef>	some stuff doesn't show up as cache even when it is
Mar 05 13:29:44 <livingbeef>	like zfs cache
Mar 05 13:30:29 <jamea2000>	friends... somebody testerday helped me with this command: sort 2167034351004653_P36vN0.csv  -k 1 -n -t ,  > 2167034351004653_P36vN0IT.csv    but not sort numerical, mi first column is numerical, any advice? thanks
Mar 05 13:30:44 <bombastick>	steering: even 15 years ago, on Notepad++, I could open a multi-GB text file and scroll through it at great speed. Now OK, weechat needs to structure the raw data (parse lines, color nicks, etc) but it shouldn't be yuuge
Mar 05 13:31:26 <wyre>	livingbeef, https://bpa.st/MDEA it's still the same but it seems to have flushed the cache
Mar 05 13:31:39 <wyre>	livingbeef, we haven't zfs ... but nfs
Mar 05 13:31:52 <steering>	bombastick: sure, if you had multiple GB of ram
Mar 05 13:32:00 <steering>	(and turn off syntax highlighting, probably)
Mar 05 13:32:03 <livingbeef>	jamea2000: yes, read sort manpage
Mar 05 13:32:14 <jamea2000>	thanks livingbeef!
Mar 05 13:32:44 <Artfaith>	jamea2000, for the first column only, `-nk 1,1` I believe.
Mar 05 13:33:12 <jamea2000>	ok, test thanks Artfaith!
Mar 05 13:33:41 <Artfaith>	e.g. `ls -la | sort -nk 5,5;`
Mar 05 13:39:41 <Afifteenyearoldg>	I've made a project for people who work with multiple operating systems (vm, docker ci cd ct etc.) and also begginners who want to switch between operating systems (so package managers) that is capable of understanding multiple package manager commands (using It's own optimized DB) and able to convert any package manager representation to your
Mar 05 13:39:42 <Afifteenyearoldg>	system's package manager.
Mar 05 13:39:42 <Afifteenyearoldg>	So in windows you can emulate pacman, brew etc. (but using your native mirror +pkg names)
Mar 05 13:39:43 <Afifteenyearoldg>	To sum it all up: Whatever you write, It understands and rewrites the command that is executable by your system.
Mar 05 13:40:20 <Afifteenyearoldg>	I want to discuss about how'd you find this project: ((not/)useful) ((not)/good)
Mar 05 13:41:52 <bombastick>	Afifteenyearoldg: unmaintainable
Mar 05 13:42:24 <Afifteenyearoldg>	in which way? (updating the db?)
Mar 05 13:42:29 <circuitbone>	what does it replace Afifteenyearoldg ?
Mar 05 13:42:51 <bombastick>	circuitbone: I guess every other package manager. (cue xkcd link)
Mar 05 13:43:25 <Afifteenyearoldg>	It doesn't replace anything but actually abstract away the non-standerdized package manager ecosystem + install scripts etc.
Mar 05 13:43:26 <Afifteenyearoldg>	(So by aliasing my project you can easily execute a script that is not suitible for your system)
Mar 05 13:43:50 <Afifteenyearoldg>	circuitbone: Also it isn't a package manager rather a package manager manager
Mar 05 13:44:03 <Afifteenyearoldg>	((package manager) manager) in lisp
Mar 05 13:44:05 <Guts71>	Is tkinter the best tool for creating mdern GUIs in linux ?
Mar 05 13:44:23 <stenno>	just do a web interface like everyone else
Mar 05 13:44:24 <bombastick>	Afifteenyearoldg: does it only work for select apps? like "firefox" apt installs Firefox on DEbian, or uses chocolatey/winget on Windows?
Mar 05 13:44:26 <circuitbone>	that sounds like the sales pitch, who would want that now Afifteenyearoldg ?
Mar 05 13:44:41 <bombastick>	Guts71: Qt, specifically QML
Mar 05 13:44:50 <Afifteenyearoldg>	Guts71: best is subjective. First say what you want then expect an answer
Mar 05 13:45:05 <bombastick>	It's not subjective, I'm right and everyone else is wrong
Mar 05 13:45:19 <Afifteenyearoldg>	bombastick: wdym by selected apps?
Mar 05 13:45:50 <Afifteenyearoldg>	it'll try to install the package name you give it to it. Nothing is touched by the program as a package name (even libcurl and curl-devel)
Mar 05 13:46:44 <ioria>	Afifteenyearoldg, maybe give us a real-life usage example (to get it better)
Mar 05 13:47:04 <Afifteenyearoldg>	circuitbone: It's fully open source and very simple project that I'll be attending to competitetions (just want some feedback from someone who "knows")
Mar 05 13:47:20 <circuitbone>	who would use such a tool? someone who tests lots of installations?
Mar 05 13:47:29 <circuitbone>	trying to find the primary user
Mar 05 13:47:41 <steering>	Afifteenyearoldg: what problem does it solve? the user still has to figure out the different package names between systems, right?
Mar 05 13:48:43 <steering>	that's a lot more difficult than figuring out `apt install` vs `yum install`
Mar 05 13:48:46 <steering>	(`dnf install`? idk)
Mar 05 13:49:18 <Afifteenyearoldg>	ioria: You have a 1000 line install script that you want to use on your github ci script but you need to run it on APT package manager.
Mar 05 13:49:19 <Afifteenyearoldg>	Instead of installing APT, you can have merge (my program) that is far more smaller than APT. And you'll be able to run your package manager commands by just aliasing like so:
Mar 05 13:49:19 <Afifteenyearoldg>	     alias apt="merge apt"; # So all the input goes to my program
Mar 05 13:50:32 <Afifteenyearoldg>	circuitbone: Yes. Also docker devs, and virtual machine testers which may require to use different OSes simultaniosly
Mar 05 13:50:49 <circuitbone>	hmm ok
Mar 05 13:51:30 <ioria>	Afifteenyearoldg, sounds like a 'only' devs tool; am i wrong ?
Mar 05 13:51:54 <Afifteenyearoldg>	steering: I first planned creating a new representation that will transpile to your system's repr.
Mar 05 13:51:55 <Afifteenyearoldg>	But then I didn't want to put up a new standard that will require people to learn so I made a program that is able to understand every pkg manager that is better and standerdized
Mar 05 13:52:05 <Afifteenyearoldg>	ioria: yeah
Mar 05 13:52:17 <ioria>	good, then it's a good idea
Mar 05 13:52:23 <Afifteenyearoldg>	It's only for people who are using package managers
Mar 05 13:52:43 <zanoh>	Afifteenyearoldg, So you re-invented packagekit?
Mar 05 13:53:01 <Afifteenyearoldg>	and Some may like the other package manager's representation (e.g a lot of people find pacman's representation neater compared to something like xdg)
Mar 05 13:53:13 <Afifteenyearoldg>	xbps*
Mar 05 13:53:30 <Afifteenyearoldg>	zanoh: Let me check what packagekit is
Mar 05 13:58:05 <Afifteenyearoldg>	zanoh: I don't think I did understand it correctly but it is a daemon which my program isn't
Mar 05 14:05:03 <Afifteenyearoldg>	zanoh: After searching a bit furthermore it looks like I did wrote the same software that is packagekit. but packagekit uses GUI backends (which'd use CLI lmao)
Mar 05 14:05:13 <Afifteenyearoldg>	this project isn't original so
Mar 05 14:05:31 <ioria>	there's also a cli for it
Mar 05 14:05:43 <ioria>	packagekit-tools
Mar 05 14:07:06 <ioria>	but i don't think a lot of people use it
Mar 05 14:07:42 <zanoh>	Packagekit sucks. It can't resolve errors and can only do rudimentary upgrades or installs compared to regular package manager.
Mar 05 14:08:03 <zanoh>	I'll give you an example. Both gnome-software and KDE plasma-discover use packagekit to interface with repo updates.
Mar 05 14:08:16 <zanoh>	On debian, there was a kernel update pulled because of a bug resulted from a bad backport.
Mar 05 14:08:56 <zanoh>	I had multiple packages to upgrade with gnome-software, including the pulled one, and packagekit refused to upgrade any of them because of a cryptic error that it was missing.
Mar 05 14:09:05 <zanoh>	Apt handled it fine by just upgrading only what was avilable.
Mar 05 14:09:17 <ioria>	the shock was when a user told me that his machine was updating at restart (like Windows) ... and ended up to be /usr/lib/packagekit/pk-offline-update
Mar 05 14:09:23 <Guest44>	Hello again
Mar 05 14:09:23 <Guest44>	I seem to have resolved my boot issues - so I'm just about to install US on the Lenovo laptop and I just need some advice
Mar 05 14:09:24 <Guest44>	I've created a new partition in the remaining free space on the HD and I can see it in the installer and I've selected it as the installation location but I can't seem to progress past that (the create button is greyed out),
Mar 05 14:09:24 <Guest44>	Also do I need to do any editing and if so which boxes (If any) should I select in the 'flags' menu
Mar 05 14:09:25 <Guest44>	TIA
Mar 05 14:10:14 <zanoh>	So I hate packagekit. I refuse to use it and would always rather just upgrade through the command line because GUI package managers just suck.
Mar 05 14:11:38 <steering>	zanoh: so... how long before it starts taking over other functionality and becomes necessary for every mainstream distro? :)
Mar 05 14:11:52 <zanoh>	Never going to happen. steering.
Mar 05 14:11:58 <steering>	Is that so?
Mar 05 14:12:09 <zanoh>	Because all it is just a middleman for package updates.
Mar 05 14:12:11 *	steering glances at systemd, nm, polkit
Mar 05 14:12:32 <zanoh>	Systemd, yes. But on debian at least, you can live fully without polkit or network-manager.
Mar 05 14:12:55 <zanoh>	Debian by default with a basic install doesn't have packagekit, network-manager, or polkit installed.
Mar 05 14:12:55 <steering>	I get polkit pulled in by gnome, IIRC.
Mar 05 14:13:04 <steering>	I'd be surprised if not by KDE
Mar 05 14:13:11 <zanoh>	I don't recall if KDE pulls it in.
Mar 05 14:13:17 <steering>	most distros also pull in nm, at least on gnome
Mar 05 14:13:44 <zanoh>	With KDE, you can cherry pick packages you don't want. So avoid plasma-nm
Mar 05 14:14:01 <zanoh>	GNOME is harder to avoid.
Mar 05 14:14:16 <zanoh>	But I think in theory, possible.
Mar 05 14:14:45 <hangint3n>	good morning gents and ladies
Mar 05 14:14:54 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Mar 05 14:14:54 <zanoh>	Example, I can if I desired to, install gdm3 without pulling in the entire gnome stack because I can subsitute gnome-session with openbox or something else like plasma-session.
Mar 05 14:14:56 <steering>	But I digress. I was mostly making a joke, it just reminds me a lot of some other things from the freedesktop world that are even necessary (or very tough to live without) on gentoo of all things
Mar 05 14:15:07 <zanoh>	Ah
Mar 05 14:15:36 <steering>	More and more I'm tempted to go use i3 again or something :)
Mar 05 14:16:07 <steering>	might have to try out KDE though, it sounds less painful than gnome
Mar 05 14:16:25 <zanoh>	KDE is very nice. Krita for instance is a wonderful program.
Mar 05 14:17:03 <BluesKaj>	KDE has more options than gnome
Mar 05 14:17:16 <zanoh>	KDE has a better file picker than GTK. :^)
Mar 05 14:17:30 <zanoh>	By using the plasma portal, I can get a finally good file picker with firefox.
Mar 05 14:17:39 <steering>	hah!
Mar 05 14:17:53 <hangint3n>	ive used lots of desktops, but i always come bsck to kde
Mar 05 14:17:57 <zanoh>	I don't know why everyone only hates on the GTK file picker, when the stock Qt one is far more basic.
Mar 05 14:18:04 <zanoh>	And nobody ever complains about that. Ever.
Mar 05 14:18:11 <steering>	Don't get me started on file pickers. I had to forcefully uninstall xdg-desktop-portal-gnome because it has huge memory leaks and would take forever to even show up.
Mar 05 14:18:24 <steering>	Thankfully xdg-desktop-portal-gtk takes over for it and seems to works fine.
Mar 05 14:18:31 <zanoh>	You can still use the KDE portal even if gnome one is installed
Mar 05 14:18:47 <zanoh>	On debian, I set XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP="KDE" and on desktop launch, restart the portal.
Mar 05 14:18:55 <zanoh>	And on non KDE systems, I get the KDE portal.
Mar 05 14:19:22 <zanoh>	With newer versions of the portal system, you can edit the config file to select which portals to use for what.
Mar 05 14:20:18 <steering>	It took me forever to even figure out what was going on. For some reason it never seemed as bad in Firefox as in Chrome. (But that could also just be my usage patterns) I had a suspicion for a while that it was the cause but never had a way to confirm it.
Mar 05 14:20:48 <zanoh>	Even if you use GNOME, you can still use my (though a bit hacky) solution to make the portals think you're on KDE instead of GNOME.
Mar 05 14:21:04 <steering>	Once I confirmed it I just threw it in package.provided and tried it out and stopped thinking about it after like 1.5yrs
Mar 05 14:21:27 <zanoh>	I do wonder what KDE plasma 6 will be like by 2025.
Mar 05 14:21:42 <steering>	and Nautilus/the file picker really annoys me these days.
Mar 05 14:21:59 <zanoh>	Evince doesn't even have tabs. Top scientists are baffled by this.
Mar 05 14:22:06 <steering>	between the "sort by is a global option" and "pressing space while typing means pick a random search result"...
Mar 05 14:22:22 <steering>	bring back nautilus from circa 2008, it was perfect
Mar 05 14:22:33 <zanoh>	Use caja or nemo I guess.
Mar 05 14:22:50 <zanoh>	Granted you'll pull in a few MATE/Cinnamon deps. But it's worth it.
Mar 05 14:23:16 <zanoh>	I just use dolphin because it's the only one that has folder previews.
Mar 05 14:23:46 <Guest44>	bump
Mar 05 14:23:49 <zanoh>	And kio is better than gvfs/gio. Example being my micro sd card gives a mount/unmount error all the time with say thunar, works fine with dolphin.
Mar 05 14:24:03 <steering>	wdym folder previews?
Mar 05 14:24:16 <steering>	like, thumbnails-of-items-inside?
Mar 05 14:24:34 <zanoh>	Sorta, dolphin can show little previews of files in a folder.
Mar 05 14:24:47 <zanoh>	I'll find an example.
Mar 05 14:25:31 <livingbeef>	there's no competition, dolphin is better than the alternatives in so many ways
Mar 05 14:25:33 <steering>	i'm imagining like on windows https://libreddit.projectsegfau.lt/r/windows/comments/ymziae/evolution_of_picture_folder_thumbnails/
Mar 05 14:25:50 <zanoh>	Sorry for the long link:
Mar 05 14:25:51 <zanoh>	https://userbase.kde.org/images.userbase/thumb/a/a8/Dolphin_folder_hovered_deselect.png/800px-Dolphin_folder_hovered_deselect.png?20180102120634
Mar 05 14:26:08 <steering>	yeaaaah that would be nice sometimes
Mar 05 14:27:10 <zanoh>	KDE portal is a bit of a PITA to get PDF previews to work, but once properly configured, it's awesome.
Mar 05 14:28:00 <livingbeef>	filtering, tagging, thumbnail layout, file previews, terminal-in-window, ftp, zip, ssh and probably a bunch more advantages
Mar 05 14:28:21 <zanoh>	I wonder if anyone still uses konqueror as their file manager.
Mar 05 14:29:12 <ioria>	it had a webrowser embedded if i remember correctly
Mar 05 14:29:20 <livingbeef>	rating, sort and grouping options
Mar 05 14:29:22 <zanoh>	Yes, konqueror uses qtwebengine.
Mar 05 14:29:25 <steering>	ioria: yeah. it was basically explorer
Mar 05 14:29:31 <ioria>	yeah
Mar 05 14:29:55 <bn_work>	Q:  Linux Alma 8.6, kernel = 5.10.13-x86_64, should fsck normally show output if it's "doing something"?  or is this output indicative that the machine is hung? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/JXurEBkb/dmesg.log
Mar 05 14:30:08 <steering>	now everything *except* your file manager has a browser in it!
Mar 05 14:30:40 <bombastick>	Can someone help me understand why logrotate's daily job isnt rotating my files, but running it manually does? https://paste.debian.net/plain/1309521   I'm new to logrotate.
Mar 05 14:30:43 <zanoh>	I don't know if I would use qtwebengine because it's tied down directly to the Qt release. It's just not practical if on a non arch linux distro to use QtWebengine.
Mar 05 14:30:58 <steering>	I have qtwebengine installed solely for Calibre.
Mar 05 14:31:12 <zanoh>	Cool
Mar 05 14:31:14 <steering>	It's enormous and updates frequently. As a Gentoo user, I hate it. :P
Mar 05 14:31:54 <Siecje>	I have an encrypted partition which I would like to be my root filesystem. In initramfs I have an /init https://dpaste.org/S3M6P which unlocks the partition. What else needs to happen to make that partition the root filesystem?
Mar 05 14:32:05 <Guest44>	Can anyone help out with an Ubuntu Studio installation issue?
Mar 05 14:32:33 <Siecje>	Guest44: What's the issue?
Mar 05 14:33:14 <steering>	Siecje: pivot_root, but it's been so long I can't say much more than that
Mar 05 14:33:46 <Guest44>	Siecje Thanks! I've created a new partition in the remaining free space on the HD and I can see it in the installer and I've selected it as the installation location but I can't seem to progress past that (the create button is greyed out),
Mar 05 14:33:46 <Siecje>	steering: What does /sbin/init do?
Mar 05 14:34:15 <Siecje>	Guest44: Is it empty? Does it have a filesystem?
Mar 05 14:34:17 <zanoh>	I think these days, /sbin/init is just a symlink like /bin/sh is.
Mar 05 14:34:42 <Siecje>	zanoh: It's a binary file. This one is anyways.
Mar 05 14:34:50 <steering>	Siecje: what do you mean what does it do?
Mar 05 14:34:53 <zanoh>	Nobody uses the OG bourne shell. Not even *BSD systems. They just symlink to somethign else.
Mar 05 14:34:59 <Siecje>	If I do pivot_root should I still call /sbin/init?
Mar 05 14:35:02 <Guest44>	Siecje it is empty but it's formatted as Ext4
Mar 05 14:35:35 <Siecje>	Guest44: strange. I don't have any ideas besides restarting the GUI.
Mar 05 14:36:09 <steering>	Siecje: yes. `exec /sbin/init` makes init be your new PID 1 (which is special and needs to run forever). plus init will start up all the other processes you need like your login prompts etc.
Mar 05 14:36:25 <Guest44>	Would that mean starting again basically?
Mar 05 14:36:31 <livingbeef>	qtwebengine is certainly a pain to compile on weaker systems
Mar 05 14:36:42 <steering>	Siecje: you can probably find the script that some distro uses for their initramfs and crib from it.
Mar 05 14:37:14 <Siecje>	steering: this came from buildroot
Mar 05 14:37:21 <livingbeef>	upgrading from 4MB L3 cache to 32MB helped enormously
Mar 05 14:37:42 <steering>	livingbeef: my system isn't all that weak, sadly... i5-9600k and building on tmpfs, it takes nearly 2 hours
Mar 05 14:38:13 <zanoh>	Is there really any net-benefit to building qtwebengine from source though?
Mar 05 14:38:39 <steering>	zanoh: I mean... especially since I only use it for Calibre... no.
Mar 05 14:38:56 <steering>	but I wasn't set up for gentoo's new binpkgs til last week :P
Mar 05 14:39:17 <livingbeef>	compilation is one of the things which depend on cache a LOT
Mar 05 14:39:52 <livingbeef>	9600k might not be that great in that regard, nowadays
Mar 05 14:39:54 <steering>	livingbeef: true. more cores would also help.
Mar 05 14:40:26 <zanoh>	I might just jump ship to webkitgtk once it can support firefox extensions. Firefox is feeling more and more like a lost cause sadly.
Mar 05 14:40:52 <bombastick>	oh WTF...I found my issue. logrotate.service has a condition to only run if on AC power. And although my system is on AC power (it's a mini server), it's not being detected as such. WTF would a daily log rotation refuse to run on battery anyway?
Mar 05 14:40:58 <livingbeef>	it's controlled opposition
Mar 05 14:41:18 <zanoh>	The difference between incompetence and malice is slim.
Mar 05 14:41:25 <stenno>	hanlons razor
Mar 05 14:41:38 <bombastick>	are you guys just repeating reddit catchphrases?
Mar 05 14:41:45 <zanoh>	I don't use reddit
Mar 05 14:41:46 <steering>	bombastick: you'll get 15 seconds more battery life!
Mar 05 14:41:56 <zanoh>	Especially now that they feed your posts into an AI training program.
Mar 05 14:42:01 <stenno>	what is a 'reddit catchphrase'
Mar 05 14:42:09 <livingbeef>	they're competently doing their paymaster's bidding, it's just selfinterest
Mar 05 14:42:16 <Guest44>	Siecje  sorry to butt in!  I'm going to recreate the partition - can you recommend which boxes to select in the 'flags' menu? Options are 'boot'  'root' 'swap' etc
Mar 05 14:42:21 <bombastick>	stenno: umm, correlation does not equal causation
Mar 05 14:42:41 <stenno>	well that is a correct statement in of itself
Mar 05 14:42:49 <stenno>	depends on the context it is used
Mar 05 14:42:50 <steering>	bombastick: nice strawman
Mar 05 14:43:21 <zanoh>	I don't see firefox as a tool for google, given how their market share is shrinking. They're just idiots.
Mar 05 14:43:39 <bombastick>	it's almost as if people I agree with politically are heroes and those I don't are villains
Mar 05 14:43:44 <livingbeef>	That's exactly how they're a tool for google
Mar 05 14:44:02 <stenno>	imagine having heroes in post-modernism
Mar 05 14:44:05 <stenno>	smh
Mar 05 14:44:21 <zanoh>	We don't live in post-modernism. No, it's post post post post irony these days.
Mar 05 14:45:06 <zanoh>	I can't wait for everyone to be so sick of irony poisioning they'll wind the clock back to 2007 and actually like things again.
Mar 05 14:45:08 <Siecje>	Guest44: root? I'm not sure.
Mar 05 14:45:40 <Guest44>	That makes two of us :)
Mar 05 14:45:52 <bombastick>	zanoh: impossible with the entire planet watching you on social media. you cant be yourself. you can just say the things that social media wants you to say to fit in.
Mar 05 14:46:07 <zanoh>	Social media was a mistake.
Mar 05 14:46:14 <stenno>	maybe social media is just a fad
Mar 05 14:46:25 <zanoh>	If it's a fad, it's been a very long fad.
Mar 05 14:46:46 <stenno>	people begin to realize that having upvote echo chambers is not really conductive for societal discourse
Mar 05 14:46:56 <livingbeef>	*fed
Mar 05 14:47:21 <zanoh>	I'm also tired of this very american-centric culture war. Muh left vs muh right about literally everything. Throw in the trump election and you got a recipie for disaster.
Mar 05 14:47:25 <bombastick>	Yep my logrotate bug is a systemd bug https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/24214
Mar 05 14:47:40 <bombastick>	but I blame Debian maintainers for thinking a log rotation shouldnt run on battery
Mar 05 14:47:52 <sheep>	Siecje: you also need to run pivot_root to switch from the initramfs root to the real root
Mar 05 14:47:59 <stenno>	zanoh: i am surprised by the reaction of americans if i tell them i like neither republicans nor democrats
Mar 05 14:48:05 <stenno>	anyway, far too offtopic here, sorry
Mar 05 14:48:17 <zanoh>	Right, lets get back to linux. :D
Mar 05 14:48:18 <bombastick>	it's OK, the ops aren't around
Mar 05 14:48:31 <zanoh>	Mods are sleep, post ponies.
Mar 05 14:48:49 <marcopolo1>	If i do apt remove cinnamon* does it truly remove everything related to cinnamon?
Mar 05 14:48:59 <zanoh>	Wildcard would say yes.
Mar 05 14:49:08 <bombastick>	https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi.huffpost.com%2Fgen%2F952658%2Fimages%2Fo-SHETLAND-PONY-CARDIGANS-facebook.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=0f52af107e05feb7457ad35b8f9b1395ab8dfb9588770eca67ce8602d558299f&ipo=images
Mar 05 14:49:15 <zanoh>	What DO you want to remove though marcopolo1?
Mar 05 14:49:21 <hexnewbie>	The ops aren't here? oooh! Then I wish to file a complaint. “docker ps” never exits, I ran it an hour ago!
Mar 05 14:49:37 <Artfaith>	bombastick, https://youtu.be/dEMKVFbO5V0 (The True Cost of Mining for the $500 Billion Electric Car Industry...)
Mar 05 14:49:43 <sheep>	it just removes the cinnamon package and its contents. You would also need "apt autoremove" after that to remove dependency packages that are no longer needed
Mar 05 14:49:52 <bombastick>	Artfaith: why link me?
Mar 05 14:50:02 <Artfaith>	'Cause batteries worth consideration!
Mar 05 14:50:04 <livingbeef>	zanoh: you can say that, but so long as you're the empire's vassal, the civil war is going to affect you
Mar 05 14:50:06 <Siecje>	sheep: That's what I'm trying to do. Any idea how to use pivot_root? I'm getting Invalid argument and also I don't want to put the old root anywhere.
Mar 05 14:50:11 <zanoh>	I would also if you do NOT want config files left over, use purge intead of remove.
Mar 05 14:50:11 <bombastick>	I'm not likely to ever buy a car again
Mar 05 14:50:12 <marcopolo1>	zanoh: cinnamon desktop
Mar 05 14:50:15 <hexnewbie>	(Wanted to test a command regarding earlier discussion an unused box that has docker images running)
Mar 05 14:50:29 <Artfaith>	s/car/machine, and s/machine/computer
Mar 05 14:50:34 <bombastick>	I moved somewhere where you need a motorbike or you get stuck in traffic all day
Mar 05 14:50:39 <marcopolo1>	Well i can do autoremove after
Mar 05 14:50:49 <zanoh>	autoremove doesn't get rid of config files.
Mar 05 14:50:50 <Siecje>	sheep: I'm in an initramfs shell. I want to set the root filesystem. Do I need to mount that filesystem? pivot_root seems to accept directories.
Mar 05 14:50:56 <Artfaith>	bombastick, I have the same issue in Germany or Italy. Bikes here.
Mar 05 14:50:57 <zanoh>	You must pass --purge for that.
Mar 05 14:51:49 <sheep>	Siecje: you need to mount the new root filesystem first, then pivot_root <path to root mount point> <path to where the old initramfs root should now be mounted, like /old-root>
Mar 05 14:52:39 <Siecje>	sheep: I get Invalid argument
Mar 05 14:52:49 <sheep>	Siecje: what was the full command you used?
Mar 05 14:53:23 <Siecje>	sheep: `privot_root /media/mmcblk0p2 /oldroot`
Mar 05 14:53:39 <zanoh>	Why does everyone still use ` ` when $( is recommended over it?
Mar 05 14:53:46 <sheep>	did you mount it as /media/mmcblk0p2?
Mar 05 14:53:54 <Siecje>	sheep: Yeah
Mar 05 14:54:08 <stenno>	what if i use both `` and $() because i was nesting something
Mar 05 14:54:09 <sheep>	does /oldroot exist?
Mar 05 14:54:14 <Siecje>	zanoh: In IRC beacause it's faster. In sh files? Because they don't better?
Mar 05 14:54:30 <Siecje>	sheep: yes otherwise I get No such file or directory.
Mar 05 14:55:11 <livingbeef>	stenno: don't use `` unless it's very short and obvious
Mar 05 14:55:20 <ananke>	zanoh: who's 'everyone'?
Mar 05 14:55:31 <zanoh>	Me, Myself, and I.
Mar 05 14:55:40 <ananke>	zanoh: then go ask yourself
Mar 05 14:55:52 <zanoh>	Me, what is the meaning of life?
Mar 05 14:56:28 <sheep>	Siecje: sorry, I think I meant to use switch_root /media/mmcblk0p2 /sbin/init instead. Apparently pivot_root is only for old initrds
Mar 05 14:56:34 <Siecje>	sheep: If I run exec switch_root /media/mmcblk0p2 /sbin/init I get back to login prompt for initramfs.
Mar 05 14:56:47 <Siecje>	I'll try without exec.
Mar 05 14:57:40 <Siecje>	I return to prompt (#)
Mar 05 14:59:00 <Siecje>	It says I need to be pid 1. I'll try doing switch_root in /init in the initramfs.
Mar 05 14:59:18 <sheep>	it does need to be switch_exec in the init script, at least according to https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Custom_Initramfs#Init
Mar 05 14:59:23 <sheep>	I mean exec switch_root
Mar 05 14:59:57 <bn_work>	so anyone know about `fsck`?  I recall that it wasn't very clear when it was "doing stuff", but it's been a while...
Mar 05 15:00:15 <Artfaith>	bn_work, is it shown in active processes?
Mar 05 15:00:32 <Artfaith>	Is active processes show it doing any processing?
Mar 05 15:00:35 <Siecje>	What does "-o ro" do in  `mount -o ro`?
Mar 05 15:00:35 <bn_work>	Artfaith: how do I check in this state of the machine?  (it's in bootup?)
Mar 05 15:01:06 <bn_work>	Artfaith: it's not letting me scroll or do anything.  PS:  this is a cloud VPS
Mar 05 15:01:10 <sheep>	mount read-only
Mar 05 15:01:12 <Artfaith>	bn_work, you mean a recovery mode shell?
Mar 05 15:01:20 <bn_work>	Artfaith: no, not yet
Mar 05 15:01:20 <sheep>	bn_work: which filesystem is it? ext4?
Mar 05 15:05:00 <bn_work>	sheep: yes, EXT4
Mar 05 15:05:23 <marcopolo1>	Do i need xorg for picom
Mar 05 15:05:54 <sheep>	I don't remember if fsck.ext4 (which fsck runs for ext4) shows any progress while it's running, but someone else may know
Mar 05 15:06:18 <sheep>	marcopolo1: picom is an X compositor, so it needs an X server such as Xorg
Mar 05 15:07:45 <bn_work>	sheep: would that last error `modprobe: FATAL: Module nf_nat_ftp not found.` cause any issues or cause a hang?  I see the Cloud Manager shows the CPU pegged but no disk I/O, which seems abnormal for fsck?
Mar 05 15:08:14 <sheep>	bn_work: no, it would just prevent iptables/nftables from being able to automatically handle non-passive FTP connections
Mar 05 15:08:38 <sheep>	that shouldn't cause a hang unless your services or init scripts are very badly written
Mar 05 15:09:35 <sheep>	if the CPU is in full use then it's probably not fsck or something related to modules
Mar 05 15:10:32 <bn_work>	sheep: well, only one CPU/core of the 2 this cloud VPS has
Mar 05 15:10:43 <bn_work>	I wish I could see what's running :/
Mar 05 15:11:17 <bn_work>	sheep: I'm afraid to interrupt it if it's in the middle of some sort of repair...
Mar 05 15:11:31 <sheep>	can you access some sort of console?
Mar 05 15:11:32 <bn_work>	FWIW, disk is only 48GB
Mar 05 15:11:56 <bn_work>	sheep: yes, LISH, but AFAICT it doesn't have any way to open another VTTY
Mar 05 15:12:08 <Artfaith>	bn_work, have you tried stracing the active process? e.g. `sudo strace -p "${pidOfFsck}";`
Mar 05 15:12:11 <sheep>	is it currently in a shell?
Mar 05 15:12:35 <bn_work>	Artfaith: *how*?  it's in bootup and not responding to any keystrokes
Mar 05 15:12:47 <Artfaith>	What does mean "bootup"?
Mar 05 15:13:08 <bn_work>	sheep: not sure, the last output was the messages above https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/JXurEBkb/dmesg.log
Mar 05 15:13:26 <bn_work>	sheep: I'm assuming it hasn't gotten to that point yet
Mar 05 15:13:28 <Artfaith>	What do you mean by "bootup"?
Mar 05 15:13:32 <sheep>	it doesn't respond to ctrl+z?
Mar 05 15:13:50 <bn_work>	sheep: nope
Mar 05 15:13:54 <Artfaith>	Why is it not possible to Ctrl+Alt+F3 for example?
Mar 05 15:13:58 <Artfaith>	What about magic keys?
Mar 05 15:14:02 <bn_work>	Artfaith: this is a cloud VPS
Mar 05 15:14:16 <sheep>	did you try entering F, I, S, or Y?
Mar 05 15:14:23 <Artfaith>	I believe normal Cloud VPS allows connecting to an alternative TTY?
Mar 05 15:14:43 <sheep>	yes, if init finished and spawned getty on the other TTYs
Mar 05 15:14:48 <bn_work>	Artfaith: not sure what stage of bootup it's in, if that's what you're asking?  It seems it can't get past mounting root as it (appears) it's trying to do a fsck?
Mar 05 15:15:04 <bn_work>	sheep:  I tried F
Mar 05 15:15:16 <Artfaith>	sheep stated quite a notice. fsck there prompted for action.
Mar 05 15:15:21 <Siecje>	With the /init changes I don't get a shell. I do see end Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init! exitcode=0x00000100
Mar 05 15:15:26 <bn_work>	sheep: is y = F?
Mar 05 15:15:34 <sheep>	not sure
Mar 05 15:15:42 <Artfaith>	What is the Cloud?
Mar 05 15:15:50 <sheep>	Siecje: it sounds like it tried to exec an init that isn't there, but I could be wrong
Mar 05 15:16:00 <bn_work>	Artfaith: yes, and I hit one of those options obviously, lol
Mar 05 15:16:11 <Artfaith>	I see. What is the cloud vendor name?
Mar 05 15:16:13 <bn_work>	Artfaith: Linode
Mar 05 15:16:15 <Artfaith>	I see.
Mar 05 15:16:29 <bn_work>	(normally never have issues like this)
Mar 05 15:16:36 <Siecje>	sheep: okay I was expecting it to fail and put me in a shell. The partition isn't encrypted (I was going to do that manually) so it is trying to init a device that doesn't exist.
Mar 05 15:17:01 <bn_work>	but for some reason they decided to auto-migrate all our server en-masse over several days back-to-back
Mar 05 15:17:30 <Artfaith>	Linode supports various Rescue modes. Have you tried?: https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/rescue-and-rebuild/#booting-into-rescue-mode
Mar 05 15:18:35 <Artfaith>	I mean, considering magic keys won't work, and it literally stuck, I would either contact the support who has KVM access or tried to reboot the machine into more reliable environment.
Mar 05 15:19:05 <Artfaith>	By magic keys I mean https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key
Mar 05 15:19:46 <Guts71>	What is the attached software, where we can write programs in python? https://imgur.com/F8UmbcE
Mar 05 15:20:31 <ananke>	'attached software'?
Mar 05 15:20:36 <Artfaith>	Guts71, PyCharm is one of the most awesome for Python I am aware. Otherwise, VSCode and then Sublime Text .
Mar 05 15:20:47 <Artfaith>	Those are for GUI. TUI? Neovim.
Mar 05 15:20:51 <Siecje>	In a sh script how can I wait for umount -l to complete?
Mar 05 15:21:05 <ananke>	Siecje: don't use -l
Mar 05 15:21:16 <Siecje>	ananke: But then it will say it is busy.
Mar 05 15:21:28 <ananke>	Siecje: but you want to wait
Mar 05 15:21:29 <Artfaith>	Siecje, https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/385791/133353
Mar 05 15:21:37 <Siecje>	ananke: It doesn't wait.
Mar 05 15:21:51 <ananke>	Siecje: ohh, I see. you have something using it, and you want to continue to wait asynchronously
Mar 05 15:21:55 <Artfaith>	I would also run a loop waiting for certain disks to get unmounted watching.
Mar 05 15:22:05 <Guts71>	Artfaith Yes its using some Tkinter tool !
Mar 05 15:22:09 <Artfaith>	If not "sync" which may touch different cases like copy/pasting even.'
Mar 05 15:22:15 <Siecje>	ananke: no synchronous is fine
Mar 05 15:22:20 <Artfaith>	Guts71, I am sorry?
Mar 05 15:22:20 <bn_work>	Artfaith:  so should I interrupt this procedure right now?
Mar 05 15:22:38 <Siecje>	so umount;sync?
Mar 05 15:22:47 <Artfaith>	bn_work, if there's something really important, I would request support from their officials.
Mar 05 15:22:56 <bn_work>	Artfaith:  Thanks, which Magic key should I use?
Mar 05 15:22:57 <ananke>	Siecje: if something is actually using it, then sync won't help
Mar 05 15:23:15 <Artfaith>	It seems the online KVM does not send your input or the machine does not process it.
Mar 05 15:23:19 <Guts71>	Artfaith  https://imgur.com/F8UmbcE i mean to write some program in python for creat GUI's
Mar 05 15:23:35 <Artfaith>	Guts71, where is the question?
Mar 05 15:23:51 <ananke>	Siecje: seems this may be an X/Y problem. why are you using -l in the first place, rather than eliminating whatever is using that mount?
Mar 05 15:24:10 <Siecje>	ananke: I only said -l because it doesn't complain.
Mar 05 15:24:17 <Artfaith>	This is PyCharm, or one of the most awesome IDE for Python you can find out there. You should be alright with it I believe.
Mar 05 15:24:35 <Guts71>	Artfaith my question is what kind of window or software is this window? https://imgur.com/F8UmbcE
Mar 05 15:24:42 <Siecje>	This is a boot script. I want to umount and then only continue when it is un mounted. In my experience it says it is busy but I will try.
Mar 05 15:25:11 <Artfaith>	Guts71, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58599351/integrate-qt-designer-and-pycharm
Mar 05 15:25:22 <Artfaith>	Guts71, I said. It's PyCharm.
Mar 05 15:25:22 <ananke>	Siecje: so inspect why it's busy, eg: with lsof
Mar 05 15:25:32 <Artfaith>	i.e. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
Mar 05 15:25:55 <Artfaith>	In the legacy UI.
Mar 05 15:26:14 <Artfaith>	i.e. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/new-ui.html
Mar 05 15:26:39 <Guts71>	Artfaith Okay :) this PyCharm.could I use it on linux?
Mar 05 15:26:50 <Artfaith>	Sure you can.
Mar 05 15:27:00 <Artfaith>	JetBrains has one of the most marvelous IDEs out there.
Mar 05 15:27:07 <Guts71>	Artfaith Thanks <3
Mar 05 15:27:17 <Aleshka>	shiiiit!!!!!!
Mar 05 15:27:26 <arcturus>	its a bit problematic to use it on wayland
Mar 05 15:27:42 <arcturus>	that is to say, jetbrains is still working on wayland support
Mar 05 15:29:39 <Siecje>	ananke: I'm in a script.
Mar 05 15:30:52 <ananke>	Siecje: and?
Mar 05 15:31:13 <ananke>	Siecje: you can save the output to a file and inspect it afterwards
Mar 05 15:31:46 <Siecje>	ananke: I'm in the initramfs so I don't have persistance.
Mar 05 15:32:03 <Siecje>	This is the /init https://dpaste.org/AsYQ4
Mar 05 15:32:51 <ananke>	Siecje: clearly you're mounting some storage, so save the results on said storage
Mar 05 15:33:04 <Siecje>	thanks
Mar 05 15:58:41 <user_____>	I have to profile program running with root permissions, so I compile it with -pg and start with root but gmon.out does not get generated. starting from non-root user is fine. how to get it working for root
Mar 05 16:00:00 <bolovanos>	What do you use to catch process with higher cpu usage? I have some higher cpu usage, but it is random at this moment (https://pasteboard.co/cWcXAAQ6b4nG.png - it started yesterday, sou I could not catch the pattern). What cpu/process monitoring tool would you use to catch it? Right now I am considering "ps aux" or "pidstat"...
Mar 05 16:02:06 <tomoe>	hello
Mar 05 16:02:07 <livingbeef>	the TIME column in htop shows consumed cpu time
Mar 05 16:02:21 <livingbeef>	if it's a persistent process, you'll see it there
Mar 05 16:02:59 <stenno>	htop for the win
Mar 05 16:03:28 <mdogg>	Agreed.  There are a lot of *top's, but my favorite is htop.
Mar 05 16:05:47 <bn_work>	Artfaith: you see my message above re. the magic key?
Mar 05 16:07:29 <mdogg>	user_____: What if you switch to the root user with 'su' and then run the command you want to profile.  Then use 'perf' to profile it by the pID.
Mar 05 16:07:45 <wigums>	su -
Mar 05 16:07:56 <Artfaith>	bn_work, does `SysRq + h` work?
Mar 05 16:08:06 <mdogg>	Or sudo -i (that should work also)
Mar 05 16:12:08 <Siecje>	I'm not able to mount after luksOpen. https://dpaste.org/9XpSY I get Magic Mismatch error
Mar 05 16:12:41 <bolovanos>	livingbeef, yes, but it does not support textual output as far as I know, and most importantly - I do not know if that process is persistent. And some "persistent" process get restarted periodically - like samba etc...
Mar 05 16:13:00 <mdogg>	'perf record -g -a -F 99 -p <pid#>'   The -F option establishes the sample frequency.  Then when you think your sample is large enough, you can check out the report with 'perf report -g -n --stdio'
Mar 05 16:14:17 <marcopolo1>	I broke the sound on my linux mint
Mar 05 16:14:43 <marcopolo1>	I installed alsa oss and removed pulseaudio and now alsa doesnt work and pulseaudio neither when i reinstalled it
Mar 05 16:15:53 <mdogg>	Siecje: What is F2FS?
Mar 05 16:16:13 <Siecje>	mdogg: I don't know but I think I need mkfs after luksFormat.
Mar 05 16:16:40 <mdogg>	What filesystem are you trying to create?  ext4?
Mar 05 16:17:15 <mdogg>	Oh, F2FS is some proprietary filesystem.
Mar 05 16:17:41 <Siecje>	yeah ext4.
Mar 05 16:18:56 <mdogg>	Right now it's looking for F2FS-fs but there isn't enough information for me to tell why.
Mar 05 16:19:39 <mdogg>	Siecje: Paste the output of 'lsblk --fs'
Mar 05 16:19:59 <mdogg>	That'll add the filesystem column.
Mar 05 16:21:43 <mdogg>	Now that I think about it, I'm not sure the filesystem type will be available until after it's decrypted.  I can't recall.
Mar 05 16:22:14 <bn_work>	Artfaith: thanks, that helped:  `[ 7773.247205] sysrq: HELP : loglevel(0-9) reboot(b) crash(c) terminate-all-tasks(e) memory-full-oom-kill(f) kill-all-tasks(i) thaw-filesystems(j) sak(k) show-backtrace-all-active-cpus(l) show-memory-usage(m) nice-all-RT-tasks(n`
Mar 05 16:22:30 <Artfaith>	bn_work, I see!
Mar 05 16:22:35 <Artfaith>	So, it receives your input!
Mar 05 16:23:05 <Artfaith>	These are the commands: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key#Commands
Mar 05 16:23:55 <bn_work>	Artfaith: yes!  so any suggestions on what I can inspect?  is there a way to see the currently running process now (in this stage of boot?)
Mar 05 16:24:04 <Artfaith>	Does `SysRq + t` produce any output?
Mar 05 16:24:24 <depesz>	hi, on one machine `man grep` (or other man pages) doesn't show colors. I checked, and both this box, and another (that does show color) have the same pager, pager options, and LESS_TERMCAP_.. env variables: https://dpaste.org/aftGn
Mar 05 16:24:31 <lopid>	TERM?
Mar 05 16:24:44 <depesz>	type -a man shows the same.
Mar 05 16:24:57 <bn_work>	Artfaith: t or maybe w?
Mar 05 16:25:03 <lopid>	same version of less, with colour support?
Mar 05 16:25:08 <depesz>	lopid: same term.
Mar 05 16:25:17 <Artfaith>	bn_work, not sure it's "blocked".
Mar 05 16:25:20 <lopid>	as in `echo $TERM`
Mar 05 16:25:32 <bn_work>	Artfaith: yeah, seems it is :(  not sure why... security?  `[ 8015.123671] sysrq: This sysrq operation is disabled.`
Mar 05 16:25:51 <depesz>	lopid: same less (590)
Mar 05 16:25:54 <bn_work>	Artfaith: same with w :(
Mar 05 16:26:41 <depesz>	lopid: I can provide more info, including strace, if you think it will help.
Mar 05 16:26:54 <Artfaith>	Indeed it is a security measure. It is configured in a Kernel boot parameter: `sysrq_always_enabled`.
Mar 05 16:27:15 <Artfaith>	i.e. https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/admin-guide/sysrq.html
Mar 05 16:27:15 <mdogg>	That doesn't mean everything is blocked, though.
Mar 05 16:27:43 <lopid>	is $TERM the same, and can the not-working one show colours elsewhere?
Mar 05 16:28:02 <bn_work>	Artfaith: so any other suggestions?  (just want to know if this thing is "processing" or just hung... who knows when everything is in the cloud these days :( )
Mar 05 16:28:11 <Artfaith>	It does not, but in this case, if we know that the machine receives input, I believe you could try pressing Ctrl+D or ESC. I am curious do these work?
Mar 05 16:28:24 <depesz>	lopid: yes. for example: ls -l --color=always / /etc | less
Mar 05 16:28:31 <bn_work>	Artfaith: is loglevel 0 or 9 higher?
Mar 05 16:28:35 <depesz>	lopid: shows nicely color on both machines.
Mar 05 16:28:35 <Artfaith>	I am sure Ctrl+C was tried right?
Mar 05 16:29:09 <bn_work>	Artfaith: yes, BTW, FWIW, this VPS provider uses GNU screen to connect to "console"
Mar 05 16:29:20 <lopid>	can you less anything that shows colour? ie. not man
Mar 05 16:29:35 <bn_work>	Artfaith: "yes" as in, tried those, and they didn't work
Mar 05 16:30:14 <livingbeef>	I think so, but most everything turns color of if it sees a pipe
Mar 05 16:30:20 <livingbeef>	*off
Mar 05 16:30:31 <depesz>	lopid: yes. ls output, as I mentioned ?
Mar 05 16:31:34 <lopid>	does that go through less?
Mar 05 16:31:40 <livingbeef>	I think there's some utility that makes the pipe appear as a terminal
Mar 05 16:31:43 <depesz>	lopid: yes.
Mar 05 16:32:23 <lopid>	`ls -l --color | less -R`? (sic)
Mar 05 16:32:47 <depesz>	lopid: yhes, this command also shows colors
Mar 05 16:33:03 <depesz>	why "sic"?
Mar 05 16:33:09 <lopid>	suspect it's specifically with man, then
Mar 05 16:33:14 <yustin>	--color=always ?
Mar 05 16:33:18 <lopid>	for "color"
Mar 05 16:33:33 <depesz>	lopid: I have LESS variable set to include -R
Mar 05 16:33:34 <yustin>	works atleast with grep
Mar 05 16:33:43 <depesz>	but the value of LESS is the same in both places.
Mar 05 16:33:57 <depesz>	yustin: afaik man doesn't have such option
Mar 05 16:34:04 <mdogg>	Other than standard text, bold text, and highlighted text, I don't think I remember any colours in man pages.
Mar 05 16:34:19 <lopid>	so if man isn't outputting colour codes, less won't receive any colour
Mar 05 16:34:27 <depesz>	lopid: sure. but *why* ?
Mar 05 16:34:50 <lopid>	dunno. just narrowing it down
Mar 05 16:35:08 <lopid>	does it show bold?
Mar 05 16:35:20 <lopid>	or anything like that
Mar 05 16:35:22 <depesz>	kinda. moment. let me show you screenshot
Mar 05 16:35:54 <depesz>	https://imgur.com/nXtY6lx
Mar 05 16:36:05 <depesz>	this is how it looks for me on the "broken" box
Mar 05 16:38:32 <bn_work>	Artfaith: so even loglevel command, `9` doesn't work (despite help output claiming it does??)
Mar 05 16:39:01 <depesz>	aha. also. verifitied - it works the same way in konsole, xterm, gnome-terminal and alacritty
Mar 05 16:40:14 <lopid>	i think man is doing the right thing, too
Mar 05 16:40:51 <depesz>	so, what could be wrong?
Mar 05 16:41:08 <lopid>	dunno
Mar 05 16:41:28 <lopid>	an idea…
Mar 05 16:41:51 <Artfaith>	bn_work, it can be supported but it may not be enabled.
Mar 05 16:42:04 <Artfaith>	Does Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D work?
Mar 05 16:42:18 <Artfaith>	Does anything you type shown on the terminal?
Mar 05 16:42:28 <Artfaith>	Except the magics.
Mar 05 16:42:30 <lopid>	instead of hard coding those escape sequences, replace them with calls to tput
Mar 05 16:42:34 <Siecje>	mdogg: before decrypt fstype is crypto_LUKS
Mar 05 16:42:39 <mdogg>	Despatche: Here's mine -> https://paste.disconsented.com/upload/dwDQ8e
Mar 05 16:42:47 <mdogg>	I set those colours up in Konsole.
Mar 05 16:42:56 <depesz>	lopid: I could, sure, but verified that tput outputs the same thing.
Mar 05 16:43:03 <lopid>	oh
Mar 05 16:43:17 <depesz>	what's more. if, starting from broken box, I'd ssh to "correct" box. and then run `man grep` in the ssh session - colors work
Mar 05 16:43:22 <mdogg>	Sorry - Despatche, that was intended for depesz.
Mar 05 16:43:46 <lopid>	maybe compare `env | sort` on both hosts
Mar 05 16:44:14 <mdogg>	Siecje: And after it's decrypted what is it?
Mar 05 16:44:22 <lopid>	also try replacing with tput anyway, for lack of other thoughts
Mar 05 16:44:33 <depesz>	lopid: hard to compare - 108 lines on "bad", ~ 60 on good. but it could be because "bad" one is desktop, with x11.
Mar 05 16:44:57 <lopid>	not that hard if you sort and diff them
Mar 05 16:45:08 <mdogg>	Siecje: Once it's decrypted, 'lsblk --fs' will list everything --> That's when it should lay things out.  Like this -> https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/c0de41261581
Mar 05 16:45:14 <depesz>	lopid:diff has 135 lines
Mar 05 16:45:23 <Siecje>	mdogg: ext4
Mar 05 16:45:57 <Siecje>	mdogg: Any idea what the mmcblk0boot0 and mmcblk0boot1 are at the bottom?
Mar 05 16:46:57 <mdogg>	Siecje: Oh good.  I thought you weren't able to run 'cryptsetup-open' but maybe I misunderstood.
Mar 05 16:47:26 <Siecje>	Right now I can't switch to it as the root filesystem.
Mar 05 16:47:52 <mdogg>	Because mmcblk0boot comes after mmcblk0
Mar 05 16:48:26 <Despatche>	it just so happens that i like terminal colors too
Mar 05 16:48:40 <Siecje>	mdogg: What is mmcblk0boot? How do I fix it?
Mar 05 16:49:00 <Siecje>	mdogg: In /init I'm running switch_root after mounting the encrypted partition, I would assume that would work.
Mar 05 16:49:51 <mdogg>	Can you paste the output of 'lsblk --fs' after everything is decyrpted so we can look at it?
Mar 05 16:50:43 <mdogg>	I mean, what you pasted earlier looked like a 7GB block device with nothing else, which can't be right.
Mar 05 16:50:44 <joo>	unison is a perfect tool to create a shared folder between many machines, - but its not syncthing the hidden files (dot files) - i cant find any examples how to sync them, anyone knows anything ?
Mar 05 16:51:58 <mdogg>	Despatche: Me too.
Mar 05 16:53:07 <Siecje>	mdogg: https://i.imgur.com/cLdWHVg.jpeg
Mar 05 16:53:57 <depesz>	FOUND IT!
Mar 05 16:54:14 <depesz>	in case you got curious - on the "broken" box, i need to add: export GROFF_NO_SGR=1
Mar 05 16:54:24 <depesz>	no idea what it is for. man groff doesn't show it.
Mar 05 16:54:24 <Siecje>	mdogg: This is the /init https://dpaste.org/4yRv1
Mar 05 16:55:38 <depesz>	*or* export MANROFFOPT=-c
Mar 05 16:55:39 <mdogg>	The 'cryptsetup luksOpen' command is the old way of doing it but it seems like it still works for you.  I think they prefer 'cryptsetup-open' now.
Mar 05 16:55:42 <mdogg>	But whatver.
Mar 05 16:56:39 <mdogg>	Those last two 'mmcblk0boot?' partitions are only 4MB of unformatted space it looks like.
Mar 05 16:57:04 <Siecje>	mdogg: Should be more. Total is 8. GB I think.
Mar 05 16:57:25 <Artfaith>	bn_work, I would rather consult the official support explicitly stating the machine does not respond during storage integrity check, and the storage data is important to preseve.
Mar 05 16:57:30 <Artfaith>	preserve*
Mar 05 16:57:31 <depesz>	https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/771560/70436 << lopid , mdogg  :)
Mar 05 16:58:02 <mdogg>	Well, you're right there.  7.3GB + 8MB + 256MB
Mar 05 16:58:24 <Siecje>	mdogg: Why is there two
Mar 05 16:58:26 <bn_work>	Artfaith: only the magic keys via their LISH console produce any output in dmesg
Mar 05 16:58:48 <bn_work>	Artfaith: not understanding your last message?
Mar 05 16:58:50 <mdogg>	Siecje: They're just two partitions that are not formatted, and both partitions are 4GB in size.  I don't know why they are there.
Mar 05 16:58:54 <Artfaith>	bn_work, those work on lower level. It does not mean the actual program (i.e. fsck) responds.
Mar 05 16:58:58 <mdogg>	Sorry, 4MB in size.
Mar 05 16:59:03 <Siecje>	7.3 includes the 256
Mar 05 16:59:11 <Artfaith>	bn_work, what is not understood?
Mar 05 17:00:04 <mdogg>	Oh you're right.  So 7.3GB + 0.8GB (probably a bit less) = 8GB.
Mar 05 17:01:00 <lopid>	so it's GROFF_NO_SGR, depesz?
Mar 05 17:01:56 <depesz>	or the MANROFFOPT=-c - both of these help.
Mar 05 17:02:04 <lopid>	ok
Mar 05 17:02:13 <mdogg>	Oh I'm sorry.  8MB = 0.008GB.
Mar 05 17:02:15 <depesz>	and the problem stems from upgrafe of groff to version 1.23
Mar 05 17:02:15 <stenno>	termcap is broken in gentoo?
Mar 05 17:02:29 <stenno>	thats a thing to break..
Mar 05 17:03:10 <Artfaith>	OH! Greetings, stenno! ^^
Mar 05 17:03:15 <Artfaith>	Long time..!
Mar 05 17:04:02 <stenno>	hi
Mar 05 17:04:16 <Siecje>	mdogg: This is the buildroot config which creates the disk with the two partitions. https://dpaste.org/fXt9v
Mar 05 17:06:54 <mdogg>	I only see where it creates appfs as ext4 and the boot partition as vfat.
Mar 05 17:08:02 <Siecje>	yeah I'm not sure where they come from.
Mar 05 17:08:55 <mdogg>	They aren't doing anything - you can delete them but if you do they'll just sit there as 8MB unpartitioned space instead of unformatted space.
Mar 05 17:09:39 <mdogg>	Unless you expand the ext4 partition to include that.
Mar 05 17:10:01 <mdogg>	Anyway, it looks like you've got things working properly right now.
Mar 05 17:10:47 <Siecje>	I don't. I can't make it the root filesystem.
Mar 05 17:11:56 <Siecje>	Even if I run the commands if luksOpen fails manually and reboot so the if should be true
Mar 05 17:19:15 <nullvalue>	*yawn*
Mar 05 17:20:02 *	Norkle *bites*
Mar 05 17:21:00 <Siecje>	There is a Kernel panic https://dpaste.org/ndD1m
Mar 05 17:22:32 <mdogg>	Is this a flash memory card or is it a USB thumb drive?
Mar 05 17:23:13 <mdogg>	And it's not root because you have it mounted as /dev/mmcblk0p2
Mar 05 17:23:30 <Siecje>	mdogg: It's eMMC.
Mar 05 17:23:44 <marcopolo1>	How am i supposed to know that a program needs another program to work
Mar 05 17:23:53 <Siecje>	mdogg: Did you mean to say it's mounted as /media/mmcblk0p2?
Mar 05 17:23:58 <mdogg>	^ yes
Mar 05 17:24:16 <Siecje>	But it needs to be mounted before running switch_root. Where should I mount it?
Mar 05 17:28:28 <mdogg>	marcopolo1: If you search for a program from your distribution's package manager, there will be a section that displays a list of 'dependencies'.  If you use the package manager to install that program, the package manager will generally add the required dependencies.
Mar 05 17:30:49 <mdogg>	If you install an application from source, there will be a file that lists the required dependencies as well but it's a bit more tricky.
Mar 05 17:32:39 <mdogg>	It's generally better to let your package manager handle the programs you want to install/uninstall because that way it also takes care of any updates and patches that need to take as well.  If you install a program from source then you are responsible for applying any new versions or patches yourself.
Mar 05 17:38:59 <mdogg>	Oh, one other benefit to using your distro's package manager:  If you try uninstalling something (like 'liblua5_1-5' for example) it will warn you that doing so will impact several other applications, such as mpv and several others.  That way you know which applications will be impacted if you continue.
Mar 05 17:45:29 <spine-o-saurus>	how do i get svg image to export image layer of an existing svg, inkscape shows the layer but the program doesn't render the layer i added
Mar 05 17:47:33 <kurahaupo>	spine-o-saurus: is your new layer underneath an opaque object?

Mar 05 18:13:43 <mdogg>	Hello tomoe.  We read you loud and clear.
Mar 05 18:13:45 <tomoe>	guy's i want to know a discord server where i can talk to people who're interested in linux
Mar 05 18:13:52 <lighterowl>	;)
Mar 05 18:14:09 <Artfaith>	Sure thing!
Mar 05 18:14:16 <tomoe>	mdogg: oh sorry i wrote it twicee
Mar 05 18:14:17 <Artfaith>	Discord has built-in search, lighterowl.
Mar 05 18:14:24 <Artfaith>	tomoe,* (sorry)
Mar 05 18:14:25 <tomoe>	oh lighterowl??
Mar 05 18:15:09 <lighterowl>	I just wanted to know about the link between sysfs and devfs , not sure if and how Discord plays into that...
Mar 05 18:15:15 <lighterowl>	;)
Mar 05 18:17:31 <mdogg>	I've never been on Discord but I imagine a ton of results would come up if you searched for chat rooms containing "linux".
Mar 05 18:17:44 <mdogg>	You should be spoiled for choice.
Mar 05 18:18:18 <cjoke>	guess there have been some major event today. Instagram, facebook, google, and many others had loads of problems? network ? anyone ?
Mar 05 18:18:55 <mdogg>	I'm logged in to https://calendar.google.com right now and I don't notice any issues.
Mar 05 18:18:58 <Artfaith>	Did not notice, cjoke.
Mar 05 18:19:00 <Artfaith>	No issues here.
Mar 05 18:19:28 <Artfaith>	cjoke, https://downdetector.com/
Mar 05 18:19:50 <cjoke>	ok, I was on this https://downdetector.com/ and last hour there was like 500k report from users problems with login, and I see the graphs from other services,, that have spikes.
Mar 05 18:20:06 <Artfaith>	tomoe, https://discord.com/servers?query=linux
Mar 05 18:20:16 <tomoe>	oh yeah i did hat
Mar 05 18:20:18 <tomoe>	*that
Mar 05 18:20:27 <sacrebleu>	kurahaupo i agree but it adds complexity and in this case i dont need it
Mar 05 18:20:36 <tomoe>	Artfaith: but couldn't find any server where we could talk using microphone
Mar 05 18:21:03 <cjoke>	solar flare os something? =)
Mar 05 18:21:08 <cjoke>	s/os/or/
Mar 05 18:21:17 <mdogg>	Maybe sun spots.
Mar 05 18:21:20 <tomoe>	Artfaith: why isn't there a server with voice chat or video call rooms
Mar 05 18:21:26 <Artfaith>	This feature is controlled by moderators/administrators of the guilds, tomoe. You may need some role assigned by them.
Mar 05 18:22:10 <Artfaith>	I do not know? We had enabled for regular members only when I was a moderator in some guild with more than 100,000 members and 25,000 online.
Mar 05 18:22:55 <Artfaith>	Else, it may result in quite inappropriate content shared. You normally try to control it, and don't allow for quick get-in-out, since Discord is 13+.
Mar 05 18:22:57 <mdogg>	That would be a better question to pose on one of those Discord rooms.
Mar 05 18:23:13 <tomoe>	anyways thanks Artfaith i didn't know there was a feature to search on discord it's my first time using it
Mar 05 18:23:15 <Artfaith>	It's up to the administration of the specific guild you join, tomoe, and hence please ask them.
Mar 05 18:23:17 <tomoe>	oh
Mar 05 18:23:27 <tomoe>	yeah i will Artfaith
Mar 05 18:23:31 <tomoe>	;)
Mar 05 18:23:33 <Artfaith>	I believe there are guilds with voice/video enabled for new members, of course.
Mar 05 18:24:30 <Artfaith>	In other words, it's all enabled by default, and gets disabled manually by guild moderators/administrators/owner.
Mar 05 18:24:43 <mdogg>	Is there a voice plugin that can be added to the IRCd?
Mar 05 18:25:59 <kfrench>	mdogg: Do you want your office to sound like a family gathering?
Mar 05 18:28:07 <jamea2000>	not know why not see your answer... Artfaith
Mar 05 18:28:16 <jamea2000>	sort 2167034351004653_P36vN0.csv  -k 1 -n -t ,  > 2167034351004653_P36vN0IT.csv    but not sort numerical, mi first column is numerical, any advice? thanks
Mar 05 18:28:46 <mdogg>	Well, I was thinking of having that option so that we could have a host and a guest speak about some Linux topic and the folks in the channel could continue typing about whatever and people could then opt in to ask the host and guest questions or make comments about their discussion.
Mar 05 18:28:51 <Artfaith>	jamea2000, as mentioned previously...
Mar 05 18:28:58 <Artfaith>	-k 1,1 and not -k 1
Mar 05 18:29:07 <Artfaith>	`-nk 1,1` and not `-nk 1`
Mar 05 18:29:34 <mdogg>	Actually, that's been something I have been storyboarding for quite a while.
Mar 05 18:30:31 <Artfaith>	mdogg, I am afraid to get banned for it actually It is the 3rd time to get banned here. Voice? Oh no.
Mar 05 18:31:02 <mdogg>	Banned for what?
Mar 05 18:31:20 <mdogg>	Your language or something?
Mar 05 18:31:31 <Artfaith>	I am afraid to make a sound someone may not like you know. Even being mute like 10 years now.
Mar 05 18:31:46 <Artfaith>	Who knows!
Mar 05 18:31:57 <jamea2000>	Artfaith
Mar 05 18:32:11 <jamea2000>	yes i know but not found .. really not see, scroll up and not see
Mar 05 18:32:16 <mdogg>	It wouldn't be a requirement for anyone to go voice.
Mar 05 18:32:52 <jamea2000>	checking
Mar 05 18:32:56 <Artfaith>	I am kidding (not really since 3 times being banned in a single channel is a record for me), but your suggestion is quite awesome.
Mar 05 18:33:02 <Artfaith>	I would love a Discord bridge.
Mar 05 18:33:11 <mdogg>	Nah, I don't want to bridge to Discord.
Mar 05 18:33:14 <Artfaith>	Here, like we have in #phpc channel.
Mar 05 18:34:02 <Artfaith>	A Matrix bridge? Matrix supports voice I belive.
Mar 05 18:34:16 <cabazon35>	what kind of timestamp is this - 4004813700500 ?
Mar 05 18:34:44 <Artfaith>	cabazon35, does not look like a timestamp.
Mar 05 18:35:39 <cabazon35>	it's marked as 'ENDTIME_us'
Mar 05 18:35:43 <cabazon35>	could it be epoch in microseconds?
Mar 05 18:36:42 <Artfaith>	It may be the fraction of a second. Like `${time}.4004813700500`.
Mar 05 18:37:04 <cabazon35>	I get it from eBPF
Mar 05 18:37:10 <cabazon35>	as I'm reading events
Mar 05 18:37:57 <Artfaith>	Like, here?: https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace/blob/master/tools/sslsnoop_example.txt
Mar 05 18:38:29 <mdogg>	I was thinking more along the lines of something like how Joe Rogan has a guest and they talk about whatever and he can also share a screen of a webpage (in this case HexChat and a certain channel) so people can follow along with what's going on.  Only that's the only video aspect, the host and guest are not shown but their audio is broadcast along with any "callers" who would like to join in the conversation.
Mar 05 18:38:50 <cabazon35>	similar, yeah
Mar 05 18:39:55 <Artfaith>	cabazon35, it's `elapsed/1000` there.
Mar 05 18:40:39 <Artfaith>	i.e. https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace/blob/7c98c79573d2448f833290f55421fe8f7ea3c92a/src/pcap_writer.cpp#L29
Mar 05 18:41:03 <cabazon35>	Artfaith this is the tool I'm using https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/ext4slower.py
Mar 05 18:41:21 <cabazon35>	with --csv flag
Mar 05 18:42:12 <cabazon35>	so the timestamp comes from event.ts_us
Mar 05 18:43:36 <Artfaith>	This comes from https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#2-open_perf_buffer
Mar 05 18:44:52 <Artfaith>	These are nanoseconds
Mar 05 18:45:01 <Artfaith>	As in here, https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/intro-to-bcc-2
Mar 05 18:45:37 <cabazon35>	number of nanoseconds since system boot???
Mar 05 18:45:58 <mdogg>	If it can't measure that in picoseconds then it's useless.
Mar 05 18:46:27 <Artfaith>	cabazon35, divided by 1000.
Mar 05 18:46:39 <Artfaith>	Here: https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/ext4slower.py#L220
Mar 05 18:46:58 <cabazon35>	how do I convert it to epoch then
Mar 05 18:47:40 <cabazon35>	who comes up with such a timestamp
Mar 05 18:47:46 <jamea2000>	Artfaith Worked thanks
Mar 05 18:47:47 <Artfaith>	It seems it comes from "bpf_ktime_get_ns"
Mar 05 18:48:04 <Artfaith>	Which is: > Return the time elapsed since system boot, in nanoseconds.  Does not include time the system was suspended.  See: clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
Mar 05 18:48:12 <Artfaith>	Source: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html
Mar 05 18:48:33 <lighterowl>	so you can't convert it to epoch unless you somehow know when the system was booted
Mar 05 18:48:38 <cabazon35>	yeah I see that. It seems it's useless though
Mar 05 18:49:31 <cabazon35>	especially that I get those metrics in batches
Mar 05 18:49:32 <Artfaith>	Have you tried strfitime?: https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace/issues/2512#issuecomment-1541579300
Mar 05 18:50:02 <cabazon35>	I don't get them right away, I get them in batches. So I start ext4slower and 30 sec later I get one batch of 50 entries
Mar 05 18:50:26 <cabazon35>	so recalculating every single timestamp will always carry an error
Mar 05 18:50:41 <Artfaith>	I would change the source then.
Mar 05 18:50:46 <Artfaith>	Of the program you use.
Mar 05 18:50:55 <cabazon35>	Yeah, I think I will have to do that
Mar 05 18:51:00 <Artfaith>	Thus, I would also clarify in the repo "Issues" and #kernel
Mar 05 18:51:05 <Artfaith>	Also, here: https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace
Mar 05 18:55:33 <mdogg>	kprobe and uprobe sound like fun.
Mar 05 18:59:59 <bombastick>	is it easy to install an additional RAM stick on the new Lenovo Thinkpads? Or do you gotta pay the manufacturer their pound of flesh?
Mar 05 19:00:10 <bombastick>	Let's say I wanted 64GB RAM instead of 16
Mar 05 19:00:23 <vycka>	depends on the model
Mar 05 19:00:50 <mdogg>	bombastick: You need to lookup the laptop model to see how much RAM it can support in total, and the type of RAM it supports.  Some laptops only support a maximum of 16GB and others can go much higher.
Mar 05 19:00:53 <Namarrgon>	the extra thin models now have either partially or completely soldered on ram
Mar 05 19:00:55 <mutante>	bombastick: X1 are the good ones but RAM is completely part of the mainboard now
Mar 05 19:00:56 <Artfaith>	The datasheet of the model will clarify the maximum supported RAM amount.
Mar 05 19:00:57 <mdogg>	But you can do it yourself - it's really easy.
Mar 05 19:02:13 <vycka>	https://psref.lenovo.com/ can find all lenovo spec sheet here
Mar 05 19:02:22 <mdogg>	On the box I'm using now, it came with two 8GB sticks for a total of 16GB.  I was able to upgrade it to 32GB by removing the RAM it came with and installing two 16GB sticks.  (This box only has 2 RAM slots)
Mar 05 19:03:59 <skdnn>	I installed grub, but it doesn't find the menu file until I load it manually from emergency console -  what gives?

Mar 05 19:05:34 <bombastick>	ok thanks, checking the datasheets
Mar 05 19:06:07 <mdogg>	I like grub.
Mar 05 19:07:17 <mdogg>	skdnn: You might want to /join #grub and pose your question there.  They helped me out a couple times.
Mar 05 19:07:20 <skdnn>	I used /boot/grub2/grub.cfg filename
Mar 05 19:07:26 <bombastick>	It's just hard to believe that this https://psref.lenovo.com/Product/ThinkBook/ThinkBook_15_G5_IRL "https://psref.lenovo.com/Product/ThinkBook/ThinkBook_15_G5_IRL" is user-modifiable. That's such a thin laptop!
Mar 05 19:07:38 <beefd00r>	I use bear to generate my compilation database for neovim. Is there anything one can do to avoid having to recompile the whole project if he mistakenly executed just "make" once without the "bear --" prefix
Mar 05 19:08:04 <beefd00r>	It's rather annoying if the compilation time is more than 10 minutes
Mar 05 19:09:51 <beefd00r>	Actually.. let me rephrase it now.. is there any way to extract data into a compilation database without compiling at all?
Mar 05 19:09:52 <mdogg>	beefd00r: I suggest asking in #neovim
Mar 05 19:10:05 <beefd00r>	Fair enough
Mar 05 19:10:46 <mdogg>	I'm sure a lot of people in here use it, but that channel is dedicated to it.
Mar 05 19:11:12 <beefd00r>	Sure bud will do
Mar 05 19:16:32 <mdogg>	bombastick: According to the link you sent, if you're currently at 16GB of RAM then you're maxed out.
Mar 05 19:19:36 <Namarrgon>	"Up to 32GB DDR4-3200, 1x Soldered + 1x SO-DIMM"
Mar 05 19:20:15 <wantyapps>	Hello!
Mar 05 19:20:23 <Namarrgon>	the question is whether the so-dimm slot is already populated
Mar 05 19:20:30 <Namarrgon>	dmi-decode will tell you though
Mar 05 19:20:30 <wantyapps>	Does anyone have experience with cronjob renewing of a certbot certificate?
Mar 05 19:20:37 <wantyapps>	renewal*
Mar 05 19:21:35 <mdogg>	Namarrgon: I'm reading under "Specifications" -> "Memory" -> "Max Memory"  "Up to 16GB (8GB soldered + 8GB SO-DIMM) DDR4-3200 offering"   Unless the link he provided isn't for his model.
Mar 05 19:21:37 <MinusOne>	sure wantyapps, me and probably lots of folks here. What issue are you running into?
Mar 05 19:23:07 <wantyapps>	MinusOne: I'm having problems with my cronjob renewal. I am running an nginx proxy and made a self signed certificate, and renewing it manually works perfectly. I believe it expires every month, (I checked when creating the job) so I made a cronjob to renew it. It just doesn't work properly. It manages to renew, but somehow doesn't really work until I reboot the machine manually
Mar 05 19:23:51 <wantyapps>	MinusOne: I think I just solved the problem.. :p Maybe restarting nginx after renewing the certificate would redeploy it? Though when renewing manually I never needed to restart
Mar 05 19:24:18 <MinusOne>	that was gonna be my guess wantyapps =P
Mar 05 19:24:34 <ioria>	0  0,12 *  *  * certbot renew --post-hook "systemctl reload nginx"
Mar 05 19:24:41 <wantyapps>	I should send the code, one sec
Mar 05 19:24:48 <wantyapps>	ioria: What does the --post-hook do?
Mar 05 19:24:53 <mdogg>	Is your cronjob running a script?
Mar 05 19:24:56 <wantyapps>	Actually got it
Mar 05 19:24:57 <mdogg>	Oh I guess not.
Mar 05 19:24:58 <wantyapps>	nevermind
Mar 05 19:25:07 <wantyapps>	mdogg: A single command
Mar 05 19:25:11 <wantyapps>	one sec, sending the code
Mar 05 19:25:17 <Namarrgon>	mdogg: there are two separate SKUs with 8gb or 16gb soldered on
Mar 05 19:25:29 <ioria>	run after the execution of the previous full command line
Mar 05 19:25:32 <mdogg>	Namarrgon: Ah, I'm looking at the wrong one then I guess.
Mar 05 19:25:48 <Namarrgon>	mdogg: maybe not, i'm not sure which one bombastick owns
Mar 05 19:26:00 <mdogg>	You're right then, dmi-decode will let him know.
Mar 05 19:26:07 <wantyapps>	The code is:
Mar 05 19:26:09 <wantyapps>	1 1 1 * * certbot renew
Mar 05 19:26:10 <bombastick>	I dont own any, I'm doing research before buying
Mar 05 19:26:28 <wantyapps>	I think it is too simplistic. Trying ioria's example, adding --nginx
Mar 05 19:26:54 <wantyapps>	What is the difference between my timing and ioria's timing? (I am new to crontab)
Mar 05 19:27:07 <ioria>	the time was just an example
Mar 05 19:27:14 <wantyapps>	gotcha
Mar 05 19:27:18 <bombastick>	wantyapps: I dont want to be "that guy", but I did that a few months back with Docker, just used a container image that comes with nginx + Let's encrypt autorenewal baked in. Unless you want to make a career of this just let the geeks do the work for you.
Mar 05 19:27:18 <mdogg>	Oh, then go for the one that allows you to get more RAM.  If it comes with 16, you can probably pick up another stick for <$40
Mar 05 19:27:19 <wantyapps>	updating the file
Mar 05 19:28:35 <bombastick>	wantyapps: I used linuxserver/swag:latest
Mar 05 19:28:38 <wantyapps>	bombastick: I am a 14 year old hosting a simple portfolio site, running on Node.JS and an nginx proxy. The reason for using nginx is because it is a nice service to run on systemd, and also it hosts my mailing lists, mail server, git server, etc. I don't like working with Docker (from experience) and don't think it is the right tool for the job, as it is too complex for the simple task
Mar 05 19:28:39 <mdogg>	bombastick: I also like the fact that it is a non-touchscreen.
Mar 05 19:29:04 <wantyapps>	TL;DR don't really need anyone to do it for me, and I like the learning experience
Mar 05 19:29:05 <bombastick>	I can give you my dockerfile if you need
Mar 05 19:29:13 <wantyapps>	bombastick: no, thanks :)
Mar 05 19:29:19 <bombastick>	mdogg: what's wrong with touchscreens?
Mar 05 19:30:38 <mdogg>	They're nice on smartphones and iPads but I find them extremely annoying on everything else.  Do you really want finger prints all over your laptop screen?  Not to mention, if you use this as your main box it'll probably be plugged into an external monitor anyway.
Mar 05 19:31:25 <bombastick>	wantyapps: docker is literally the one time a Linux tool is easy to use. There's a reason why everyone on /r/selfhosted uses it. It saves time. It's relatively easy to learn (certainly compared to understanding nginx.conf).
Mar 05 19:31:34 <mdogg>	My nephew's laptop has a touchscreen and I swear the reason why he dropped it was because he was walking around using it like a tablet.
Mar 05 19:31:57 <bombastick>	You can learn the basics in an afternoon, and be intermediate in 2 days. I only needed the basics for my NAS, then 1 more day to get into advanced stuff for my cloud server
Mar 05 19:32:52 <mdogg>	wantyapps: I like cronjobs too, bro.  Don't worry, you aren't alone.
Mar 05 19:33:01 <bombastick>	it gives you repeatability on ANY Linux system, guarantees that your shit will keep working (assuming you don't just upgrade to 'latest'' like a schmuck)
Mar 05 19:33:04 <mdogg>	However I have them run scripts rather than direct commands.
Mar 05 19:33:09 <mdogg>	Makes it easier to make changes.
Mar 05 19:33:15 <wantyapps>	bombastick: I did learn Docker. Because no one is relying on my server, I tend to do it the way I like, which tends to not be the most.. effective
Mar 05 19:33:19 <wantyapps>	mdogg: yep
Mar 05 19:33:22 <bombastick>	fair enough
Mar 05 19:33:48 <wantyapps>	bombastick: deployed your cronjob, will return in a month with news :)
Mar 05 19:33:59 <mdogg>	And you get mail!
Mar 05 19:34:10 <wantyapps>	Talking about mail...
Mar 05 19:34:22 <wantyapps>	How do y'all manage mutt system notifications?
Mar 05 19:34:28 <bombastick>	I host qbittorrent, librechat (ChatGPT local UI to use GPT4 by API which is cheaper), a lot of people use it for assorted ~~piracy services~~ Linux ISO sharing services
Mar 05 19:34:39 <bombastick>	(in Docker I mean)
Mar 05 19:34:41 <SponiX>	mdogg: I'm on Plasma 6 right now. Aren't you jealous?
Mar 05 19:35:06 <kfrench>	SponiX: That's hawt
Mar 05 19:35:16 <wantyapps>	I would like having system notifications (similar to thunderbird's) from neomutt, running in the background. I did create a simple script, but it half-worked and didn't really display the email's text in the notification
Mar 05 19:35:37 <mdogg>	SponiX: I'm on 5.27.10 - is 6 nice?
Mar 05 19:35:45 <mdogg>	Or can you even tell that there's a difference?
Mar 05 19:36:19 <SponiX>	mdogg: Not for my daily usage...
Mar 05 19:36:24 <SponiX>	lol
Mar 05 19:36:49 <SponiX>	my version numbers are higher than yours though. And that is all that matters
Mar 05 19:38:08 <mdogg>	Yeah, when it comes to higher numbers, like the amount of kernel panics per day, you always win.
Mar 05 19:38:16 <wantyapps>	kek
Mar 05 19:38:23 <SponiX>	lol
Mar 05 19:38:28 <vycka>	5+27+10 > 6 checkmate

Mar 05 19:38:55 <mdogg>	I haven't had one in ages either.
Mar 05 19:39:18 <SponiX>	They are pretty common when you are trying to run Mac OS on non-Apple hardware
Mar 05 19:39:26 <mdogg>	The last time I had one was my own fault.
Mar 05 19:41:41 <SponiX>	mdogg: did I show you my new favorite CPU cooler?

Mar 05 19:44:39 <SponiX>	Fan clips are a bit of a pain in the ass. Just like the Noctua D15

Mar 05 19:51:33 <neoncortex>	wait: "For desktop computers and laptops, Microsoft Windows is the most used at 72.99%, followed by Apple's macOS at 16.13%, and Google's ChromeOS at 1.76%, and desktop Linux at 3.77%. Since ChromeOS is a Linux based OS, it can be added to the total desktop Linux share bringing it to 5.53%. 0.01% is FreeBSD and the remaining 5.32% is likely obscure Linux distributions."

Mar 05 22:33:10 <potash>	what was the saying
Mar 05 22:33:21 <potash>	every progress made by computer hardware is reversed by software
Mar 05 22:33:38 <Artfaith>	potash, https://dillo.org/
Mar 05 22:33:40 <gog>	and as a web developer i'm so sorry ok i'm sorry i don't know how it got this out of control we're trying to stop it but it keeps _growing_
Mar 05 22:34:16 <potash>	it appears my swap is zram
Mar 05 22:34:19 <potash>	how can i make it bigger
Mar 05 22:34:39 <gog>	what's your root fs?
Mar 05 22:34:51 <potash>	btrfs
Mar 05 22:34:52 <gog>	and is it on ssd?
Mar 05 22:34:55 <potash>	it is on ssd
Mar 05 22:34:57 <gog>	ah heck btrfs
Mar 05 22:35:16 <gog>	idk if it was ever fixed but putting a swap file on it was problematic for some reason
Mar 05 22:35:17 <potash>	why is it bad
Mar 05 22:35:20 <potash>	ah
Mar 05 22:35:21 <gog>	maybe it was just for suspend/resume
Mar 05 22:35:36 <gog>	but this was some time ago and i just haven't looked at btrfs since
Mar 05 22:35:39 <Namarrgon>	you can have swap files on btrfs with modern kernels
Mar 05 22:35:42 <gog>	ok
Mar 05 22:35:48 <gog>	yeah set up a swap file then
Mar 05 22:36:01 <kfrench>	And if you get that far, disable the zram.
Mar 05 22:36:02 <Namarrgon>	starting to swap is still a terrible web-browsing experience
Mar 05 22:36:12 <Artfaith>	Also http://kmeleonbrowser.org/
Mar 05 22:36:12 <gog>	it's not ideal
Mar 05 22:36:17 <potash>	as long as it wont oom and freeze im happy
Mar 05 22:36:22 <gog>	it'll stop oom
Mar 05 22:36:58 <Namarrgon>	how did you end up with that weird ram size?
Mar 05 22:37:08 <gog>	i bet it's a chromebook
Mar 05 22:37:16 <stenno>	oh wow i haven't heard dillo in ages
Mar 05 22:37:22 <stenno>	it's still around?
Mar 05 22:37:25 <potash>	Namarrgon ask the designers of Lenovo 81W0 IdeaPad 3 14ADA05
Mar 05 22:37:55 <Artfaith>	Oh, wait.
Mar 05 22:37:56 <gog>	probably 2GB eaten by the iGPU
Mar 05 22:38:03 <kfrench>	oof
Mar 05 22:38:09 <Artfaith>	KMeleon is for Windows only, apparently. Even if the source is there.
Mar 05 22:39:13 <Guest26>	pacman -Ssq patter gave not accurate list of packages
Mar 05 22:39:22 <potash>	it has a terrible cpu but i am happy with its processing speed
Mar 05 22:39:37 <potash>	it takes a little longer to compile latex documents which is the only downside i noticed
Mar 05 22:39:57 <potash>	this entire endeavor made me realise that memory is a much more important limiting factor than processor
Mar 05 22:40:34 <Disconsented>	ehh
Mar 05 22:40:34 <Disconsented>	To be a tad blunt, you're on a very outdated machine, small wonder why you're having issues
Mar 05 22:40:45 <kfrench>	potash: Someone smart once said, "All programming is an exercise in caching"
Mar 05 22:40:54 <Artfaith>	I would suggest text browser then like Carbonyl, or just upgrade the OS. I am not sure why 6G is not enough for general browsing in Firefox. It should work normally in an OS with 1GB RAM footprint itself like Archlinux32 with some light WM like AwesomeWM for example.
Mar 05 22:40:58 <kfrench>	bigger caches = faster (with diminishing returns)
Mar 05 22:41:35 <Artfaith>	4GB is small but enough for casual browsing with ~5-10 tabs opened with medium CPU load.
Mar 05 22:41:57 <potash>	perhaps with more swap
Mar 05 22:42:11 <potash>	it does 5-10 tabs fine but i need more to function as a person
Mar 05 22:42:43 <kfrench>	You'll be able to do more for sure, but you'll hit a limit eventually.  It's just whether adding swap is enough for your workload before it goes boom.
Mar 05 22:42:53 <Artfaith>	It's very general description indeed, but I had decent performance on Celeron D, 2GB RAM, Archlinux32, AwesomeWM, and Firefox. YouTube videos even played normally 720p in 2021.
Mar 05 22:43:24 <potash>	im on kde plasma but i doubt that would use much more memory
Mar 05 22:43:40 <Artfaith>	It was an environment I built specifically for Nintendo and SNES simulation in custom case.
Mar 05 22:43:49 <potash>	wow cool
Mar 05 22:44:12 <Artfaith>	KDE Plasma sure eats its graphics with the composer or even without it I believe.
Mar 05 22:44:31 <Artfaith>	Consider a WM like AwesomeWM instead DE like XFCE eve.
Mar 05 22:44:57 <Namarrgon>	part of the ram seems to be soldered on
Mar 05 22:45:05 <potash>	i wonder what the future holds with wayland et al
Mar 05 22:45:09 <potash>	going to be difficult
Mar 05 22:45:34 <Artfaith>	potash, related: https://gist.github.com/probonopd/9feb7c20257af5dd915e3a9f2d1f2277
Mar 05 22:45:54 <de-facto>	is there a way to comment out just part of a line in /bin/sh?
Mar 05 22:45:54 *	circuitbone updates his special list that points to /dev/null 
Mar 05 22:46:44 <Artfaith>	de-facto, what kind of a line and where?
Mar 05 22:46:49 <potash>	it is rather frustrating that wayland is being fielded in this shape
Mar 05 22:47:17 <Artfaith>	potash, does x11 not work in your cases?
Mar 05 22:47:29 <potash>	it does (so far)
Mar 05 22:47:44 <potash>	it seems x11 is being abandoned faster than i'd like and i am concerned, that is all
Mar 05 22:48:54 <de-facto>	Artfaith, in #!/bin/sh script i am searching a way to comment out parts of multi-line arg lists e.g. bin \n\ --arg0 val0\n\n#--arg1 val1\n\--arg2 val2
Mar 05 22:49:36 <de-facto>	id like to comment out the line --arg1 val1 but continue the concat line of args with --arg2 val2
Mar 05 22:50:28 <Guest26>	<gog> pacman -Ssq [regex-pattern] | xargs pacman -S /// pacman -Ssq gave not accurate list for packages with needed pattern
Mar 05 22:50:38 <Artfaith>	de-facto, echo `# 123` 456;
Mar 05 22:50:53 <gog>	Guest26: it's only going to match as well as you write the regex pattern
Mar 05 22:51:03 <gog>	gnome-.* for example
Mar 05 22:51:16 <gog>	pacman -Ssq gnome-.* | pacman -S
Mar 05 22:52:01 <potash>	thank you everyone for low memory/swap advice
Mar 05 22:52:05 <potash>	i shall leave now
Mar 05 22:52:28 <Guest26>	<gog> pacman -Ssq mate- gave many false pakcages
Mar 05 22:53:01 <Guest26>	or pacman -Ssq '^mate-' gave also false packages
Mar 05 22:53:12 <de-facto>	interesting Artfaith it works with backticks but not with $(  )
Mar 05 22:53:34 <gog>	it's not only looking at package names
Mar 05 22:53:47 <gog>	idk how to make it do anything else
Mar 05 22:53:56 <Guest26>	but i need only names of packages
Mar 05 22:54:25 <Guest26>	in debian it simply use * symbol
Mar 05 22:54:38 <Guest26>	why in arch is so complicated
Mar 05 22:54:49 <gog>	why don't you just do pacman -S mate
Mar 05 22:54:53 <gog>	and select the groups you want
Mar 05 22:55:45 <Guest26>	many packages have same pattern but they not in group
Mar 05 22:56:05 <gog>	that's not a pattern, it's a name of a package group
Mar 05 22:56:10 <gog>	pacman -S mate
Mar 05 22:56:15 <Disconsented>	Just check the group via the site ... ?
Mar 05 22:56:21 <Guest26>	this name pattern
Mar 05 22:56:34 <Guest26>	i need install all packages with needed pattern
Mar 05 22:56:38 <Disconsented>	https://archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/mate/
Mar 05 22:57:01 <Disconsented>	Why do you need to do that? Installing the group will install all of its packages
Mar 05 22:57:26 <Guest26>	no this not install all packages
Mar 05 22:57:58 <Guest26>	many gnome-shell extansions not installed even if you install gnome and gnome extra
Mar 05 22:58:56 <gog>	pacman -S gnome-shell-extensions
Mar 05 23:01:14 <pankaj>	I am using Linux containers. I am unable to understand the role of subuid and subgid. Can anyone explain in simple words about it please.
Mar 05 23:01:53 <Khaytsus>	It maps UID's in the container to UID's on the host system, for filesystem volumes etc.
Mar 05 23:02:03 <pankaj>	And why such long ranges are needed?
Mar 05 23:02:18 <bookworm>	because linux expects a few to be there
Mar 05 23:02:30 <Artfaith>	pankaj, https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/
Mar 05 23:02:40 <bookworm>	as nobody for example has a certain uid
Mar 05 23:03:20 <pankaj>	Artfaith: Thanks. Going through it.
Mar 05 23:03:52 <bookworm>	https://systemd.io/UIDS-GIDS/ as well
Mar 05 23:05:11 <Guest26>	<gog> when i write pacman -S mate- and press tab then i got needed list of packages, what string  will be equil to this press of key tab
Mar 05 23:08:23 <pankaj>	Guest26: Search with 'pacman -S mate-*' and then see the package you want to install individually or install all with 'pacman -S mate-*'.
Mar 05 23:08:39 <pankaj>	Guest26: Sorry, Search with 'pacman -Ss mate-*'.
Mar 05 23:11:17 <Guest26>	install pacman -S mate-* not working
Mar 05 23:11:27 <Guest26>	you will got error
Mar 05 23:11:32 <bookworm>	escape the *
Mar 05 23:11:42 <Aryan>	what is the point of btrfs resize? when all subvolumes have the same size?
Mar 05 23:12:09 <Guest26>	sudo pacman -S mate- also not working
Mar 05 23:12:14 <bookworm>	Aryan: the partition can change size
Mar 05 23:13:06 <bookworm>	say if you stack it on top of lvm or simply copy it from somewhere else to a new harddisc or such
Mar 05 23:17:59 <pankaj>	Guest26: 'pacman -S mate'??
Mar 05 23:18:26 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Mar 05 23:18:27 *	litharge sets ban on *!*@2a02:c7c:d34d:8100:64a2:f5ae:4846:6415$##fix_your_connection
Mar 05 23:18:37 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 05 23:18:43 <ZLima12>	Is there something like Overlayfs but where you can have any number of filesystems that are kept identical? I want to have an identical EFI partition on each of the three drives I have in a raid1 array, so that the system can boot from any of them in case one goes bad.
Mar 05 23:20:17 <ZLima12>	Well, identical in the contents anyway. I still want each one to have its own UUID etc
Mar 05 23:22:19 <de-facto>	is there a way to remove empty args before passing it to a binary?
Mar 05 23:23:34 <de-facto>	i mean in /bin/sh
Mar 05 23:24:55 <ssm_>	what do you mean by "remove empty args"?
Mar 05 23:25:37 <Artfaith>	de-facto, if the args are stored in array, I would remove the empty elements.
Mar 05 23:25:57 <uwharrie>	/bin/sh doesn't have arrays
Mar 05 23:26:13 <ssm_>	de-facto: I think you should use getopts and this is not an issue
Mar 05 23:26:31 <ssm_>	inside your program, C or whatever it is
Mar 05 23:26:51 <Artfaith>	i.e. a=(1 '' 2 '' 3); for i in ${!a[@]}; do [[ -z ${a[i]} ]] && unset a[i]; done; printf "'%s'," "${a[@]}";
Mar 05 23:27:22 <Artfaith>	Then, `program "${a[@]}";`

Mar 06 01:54:50 <nvz>	sumthing1980: tiling
Mar 06 01:56:05 <nvz>	sumthing1980: snapping is the act of tiling by moving a floating window either interactively against a border or using a key combo.. its a feature of most all modern windowing systems
Mar 06 01:56:33 <sumthing1980>	mint only seem to have a few, corners and sides and up down
Mar 06 01:56:42 <sumthing1980>	I want more subdivisions
Mar 06 01:56:54 <nvz>	yeah thats part of the reason I don't use it
Mar 06 01:57:13 <nvz>	its too much of a pita to manage in most winow manging environments
Mar 06 01:57:21 <nvz>	its easier for me to just put stuff where I want it
Mar 06 01:57:44 <nvz>	I dont move things around often enough to need the shortcut of "snapping"
Mar 06 01:57:52 <nvz>	I can manually tile my things as needed
Mar 06 01:58:22 <sumthing1980>	does the other ones have it xfce kde ?
Mar 06 01:59:18 <nvz>	sumthing1980: are you more a drag and drop interactive snapper or do you do it with keyboard shortcuts?
Mar 06 01:59:28 <sumthing1980>	with mouse
Mar 06 01:59:35 <yziquel>	Hi. I bought an HP machine with Ubuntu and a customised linux kernel. I recently discovered the folder where they had dumped their custom linux kernels, and discovered I had been going on all along with standard linux kernels provided by my distribution. First time I deal with a linux kernel provided by a vendor, and I'd wish to know: how do you
Mar 06 01:59:36 <yziquel>	track down how the kernel has been tweaked ?
Mar 06 01:59:47 <nvz>	sumthing1980: ah, well then gTile probably isn't what you want
Mar 06 02:00:08 <rbox>	yziquel: you get the source
Mar 06 02:00:11 <rbox>	and look at it
Mar 06 02:00:24 <nvz>	hmm maybe it is
Mar 06 02:00:35 <sumthing1980>	whichever works
Mar 06 02:01:04 <yziquel>	rbox sigh. I have the binaries. Not the source.
Mar 06 02:01:09 <yziquel>	rbox just the point.
Mar 06 02:01:12 <nvz>	sumthing1980: I havent looked at cinnamon in a long time, does it have something for installing extensions
Mar 06 02:01:22 <rbox>	apt source maybe will downlaod it
Mar 06 02:01:25 <sumthing1980>	someone said it is gtile
Mar 06 02:01:39 <sumthing1980>	is super key same as windows
Mar 06 02:01:51 <nvz>	sumthing1980: you mean cinnamon already uses gtile
Mar 06 02:02:01 <sumthing1980>	so they said
Mar 06 02:02:06 <nvz>	sumthing1980: cause gtile can configure its snap zone layouts
Mar 06 02:02:39 <nvz>	sumthing1980: I'd look in the system settings for extension management options for gtile
Mar 06 02:02:43 <nvz>	its probably in there somewhere
Mar 06 02:03:28 <yziquel>	rbox apt source will *not* download by default binaries that come from HP. Just the point. I need to know where the upstream repos are.
Mar 06 02:04:11 <rbox>	yziquel: what?
Mar 06 02:04:26 <rbox>	if its not in a repo where didy ou get this magical kernel
Mar 06 02:05:03 <rbox>	i would never use preinstalled garbage from some vendor
Mar 06 02:05:07 <rbox>	step 1 is always install fresh
Mar 06 02:05:21 <yziquel>	rbox yes. I **bought** an HP machine and it ships a binary linux kernel that does not come from "apt".
Mar 06 02:05:41 <rbox>	it came from somewehre
Mar 06 02:05:49 <rbox>	if its a ubunut, its a apcakge
Mar 06 02:05:52 <yziquel>	rbox it was delivered in /boot/HP.
Mar 06 02:05:58 <rbox>	then you need to talk to HP
Mar 06 02:06:03 <rbox>	if they're shipping garbage
Mar 06 02:06:20 <yziquel>	rbox no. i think HP is shipping a kernel taylored to the hardware.
Mar 06 02:06:28 <JerziF15Transgir>	Hi
Mar 06 02:06:31 <yziquel>	rbox customer support simply has not understood the question yet.
Mar 06 02:06:41 <rbox>	that is unforatuante
Mar 06 02:06:49 <rbox>	i hightly doubt theres anyting magical or special in there
Mar 06 02:06:50 <rbox>	lol
Mar 06 02:06:58 <yziquel>	rbox yeah. talking to a brick wall.
Mar 06 02:07:04 <rbox>	espeically if you've been suing real ones anyway
Mar 06 02:07:06 <yziquel>	rbox there are special stuff.
Mar 06 02:07:08 <rbox>	not some garbage
Mar 06 02:07:25 <rbox>	well you have to talk to them
Mar 06 02:08:50 <yziquel>	rbox there are some "stella", "graveler" "sutton-cason" projects to adapt ubuntu kernels to various hardware. by canonical.
Mar 06 02:09:08 <rbox>	okay?
Mar 06 02:09:41 <sumthing1980>	thanks
Mar 06 02:10:06 <yziquel>	rbox https://git.launchpad.net/~oem-solutions-engineers/pc-enablement/+git/oem-stella-projects-meta/refs/
Mar 06 02:10:10 <yziquel>	rbox stuff like that
Mar 06 02:10:16 <rbox>	and?
Mar 06 02:10:17 <bcn_>	I used iptables rules to allow speficic EXPECTED outbound traffic, then log all, then allow all, so that I create log entries for unexpected outbound.  I recently converted to nftables https://pastebin.com/Tery1ARc and I think maybe its not optimal?  also I'm noticing that SyncThing is making lots of hard to predict port number udp streams that flood the logs, so could I perhaps allow syncthing by process name somehow?
Mar 06 02:11:21 <yziquel>	rbox and I'm confused. I need to sort all that out. Because standard linux kernels seem to give me page faults and general protection faults when trying to run some virtualisation.
Mar 06 02:13:18 <rbox>	yziquel: step 1 wipe whatever preinstaalled garbage is tehre, install a proper fresh dist
Mar 06 02:14:25 <yziquel>	rbox you've got no clue. This is rather specialised hardware I bought. I don't play casino-compile with 12'000$ hardware.
Mar 06 02:14:29 <rbox>	lol
Mar 06 02:14:36 <rbox>	then talk to HP
Mar 06 02:15:15 <rbox>	i've gotten plenty of multi $10,000 hardware and step 1 is always install a real dist
Mar 06 02:15:27 <kfrench>	Step 3 is Profit!
Mar 06 02:15:36 <yziquel>	sigh. whether #zfs #lxc or #linux, people are so patronizing these days. I miss the 1990s so much.
Mar 06 02:15:46 <rbox>	ROFL
Mar 06 02:16:12 <katia>	yziquel, your hardware is likely very generic even at $12000 and any modern kernel would do :)
Mar 06 02:16:33 <katia>	unless you miss some specific features that are not implemented upstream?
Mar 06 02:16:36 <yziquel>	katia what I'm experiencing makes me doubt tha.
Mar 06 02:16:46 <katia>	what are you experiencing?
Mar 06 02:17:43 <yziquel>	katia many general protection faults. And it seems to depend on kernel. For now, I get my kernels from my distros. But it seems sensitive. Occurs with qemu based virtualisation mostly.
Mar 06 02:18:10 <yziquel>	katia got a frozen VM now. And it seems that if I change the kernel, it's not frozen anymore.
Mar 06 02:18:24 <katia>	what cpu is that?
Mar 06 02:18:40 <yziquel>	katia so I'm double checking all that, and now wondering about that kernel I've got delivered in /boot/HP.
Mar 06 02:18:52 <yziquel>	katia Xeon Gold. 110 cores.
Mar 06 02:19:21 <katia>	anyway could be anything, could be that you are encountering a bug that is introduced in a modern kernel for example. or some misconfiguration.
Mar 06 02:19:54 <yziquel>	katia yeah. I'm trying to dive into that. which is why I'm looking at that /boot/HP kernel and wondering...
Mar 06 02:20:07 <katia>	what version are you running now vs boot hp?
Mar 06 02:20:33 <katia>	perhaps i'd try running the same version as the hp one but non-hp'd
Mar 06 02:20:36 <yziquel>	katia some 6.1.0 oem from apt ubuntu.
Mar 06 02:20:45 <katia>	yziquel, and hp?
Mar 06 02:20:46 <yziquel>	katia I don't know what version that /boot/HP binary is.
Mar 06 02:20:56 <katia>	yziquel, boot it and run uname -a? :P
Mar 06 02:20:57 <yziquel>	katia I just got.... binaries.
Mar 06 02:21:10 <kfrench>	Or just run file on it
Mar 06 02:21:14 <yziquel>	katia yeah. I was being conservative and not running it for now.
Mar 06 02:21:39 <yziquel>	kfrench yeah. I'm backing it up for now before toying with it.
Mar 06 02:21:46 <katia>	aye run file on it :)
Mar 06 02:22:12 <yziquel>	katia i'm really conservative. I back up. then I run file.
Mar 06 02:28:41 <ZLima12>	yziquel: I don't think file can modify files
Mar 06 02:28:55 <ZLima12>	And if you're paranoid you could mount as ro
Mar 06 02:30:30 <hmnxynhiaz>	`file - < it`
Mar 06 02:31:04 <yziquel>	ZLima12 not the issue.
Mar 06 02:31:34 <katia>	yziquel, run file yet? :)
Mar 06 02:32:17 <yziquel>	katia yup
Mar 06 02:32:20 <katia>	output?
Mar 06 02:32:36 <yziquel>	katia three kernels. essentially 5.6.0 and 5.3.0.
Mar 06 02:33:38 <yziquel>	katia I'll be checking out one of them. to see if there is a change in reliability when virtualising. not much hope, though.
Mar 06 02:34:41 <yziquel>	katia maybe with checksums I'll be able to identify the kernel.
Mar 06 02:38:43 <yziquel>	katia yeah. no. they are too old.
Mar 06 02:39:01 <katia>	install debian on the thing :)
Mar 06 02:41:22 <westcoastguy>	cat /sys/class/accel
Mar 06 02:41:25 <westcoastguy>	woops
Mar 06 02:41:30 <westcoastguy>	not the right window
Mar 06 02:41:45 <westcoastguy>	(i was supposed to put that in another tmux window)
Mar 06 03:13:33 <Tum>	Hello! I would like to develop an application utilizing pressure sensitive pen input and was wondering, how exactly is this normally achieved? I tried looking through Krita's source and wasn't able to discern much... Does anyone know if there's a specific library for handling this sort of thing?
Mar 06 03:14:14 <Disconsented>	I'd probably have a hunt through waccom drivers/applications that support that
Mar 06 03:14:17 <n0xx>	isn't this just driver development_
Mar 06 03:14:34 <rbox>	the standard input system might provide pressure values in the input event
Mar 06 03:15:43 <Artfaith>	Tum, e.g. how Wacom Kernel module does it: https://github.com/linuxwacom/input-wacom/blob/9cf3859988ee56a9bbaa9176cdb67f157d283b2c/4.5/wacom_wac.c#L339
Mar 06 03:17:03 <Artfaith>	It depends on the hardware. Traditionally, you, depending on the hardware, either send a request to get sensors state, or connect to device listening to events, and then, based on known protocol, decodes the received data.
Mar 06 03:17:41 <Artfaith>	I love Wacom tablets <3
Mar 06 03:17:52 <Artfaith>	> We contribute patches directly to the Linux kernel, as well as maintain an out-of-tree kernel module that enables old kernels to work with many newer tablets.
Mar 06 03:17:54 <Tum>	I love the EMR ones
Mar 06 03:17:55 <Artfaith>	Source: https://linuxwacom.github.io/
Mar 06 03:18:35 <Tum>	thanks frend
Mar 06 03:18:45 <Tum>	good resource
Mar 06 03:19:39 <Tum>	I found Qt's QTabletEvent stuff, seems to be what I'm looking for
Mar 06 03:19:51 <Artfaith>	So, in this case, I would search for this specific manufacturer's work. If it's all closed source, I would listen to the events it sends on Kernel (e.g. straced at low levels), and would try implementing based on the data obtained, and hopefully it's well organized and not encrypted/compressed to be distinguishable.
Mar 06 03:19:52 <Tum>	But I will be investigating the linuxwacom github too, looks like good info
Mar 06 03:20:34 <phogg>	Artfaith: Wacom is great, but I am surprised it isn't standardized at all. I would have guessed this was a case supported by xinput2
Mar 06 03:23:18 <circuitbone>	wacoms dead fred, It's been fad ipad lad realms for some years.
Mar 06 03:24:22 <jasassin>	wtf is fad ipad lad
Mar 06 03:25:07 <nvz>	jasassin: if thats where you got choked up, you made it farther than I did
Mar 06 03:33:38 <agent314>	hey guys does anyone know something liek Cisco IOS in a nutshell but for Linux?
Mar 06 03:35:32 <circuitbone>	expensive vps lol
Mar 06 03:36:08 <agent314>	like a book that's like a bible of linux: it would cover things like how X11 works, how  filesystem is structured and what's in /dev and /sys folders, how linux boots up, ideally like taking a dmesg log and going through every line and explaining what happens, like how memory is structured, how drivers interact with user space, windows manager/display drivers, IO, networking etc
Mar 06 03:36:39 <agent314>	bsaically a map to mans
Mar 06 03:38:40 <agent314>	like i'm trying to install a newer version of KDE Plasma and I realized I don't actually know how KDE fits into the linux
Mar 06 03:40:16 <agent314>	i guess i could always just read code
Mar 06 03:41:27 <pedrowiski>	agent314: guess you'll never know everything, there's always something new coming up
Mar 06 03:41:30 <agent314>	but yeah, i want something like Cisco in a nutshell (which is like 2k pages) -- not something to read from cover to cover but something to look up stuff in
Mar 06 03:41:40 <agent314>	i like mans but mans are really disjointed
Mar 06 03:42:24 <agent314>	like how do look up information on how window managers "stick" into the system? man kde, man wm, man windows, man x11 doesn't do anything
Mar 06 03:42:52 <agent314>	pedrowiski: yeah but i feel like the way linux window managers work has been very similar for like decads
Mar 06 03:42:54 <agent314>	*decades
Mar 06 03:43:29 <agent314>	isn't that the reason Wayland is coming out? because X11 is too stuck in the past
Mar 06 03:46:55 <pedrowiski>	old is gold, sometimes. wayland still didn't convince me. thanks for the suggestion regarding the cisco in a nutshell. i'm starting to deal with those at work lately
Mar 06 03:47:03 <tanath>	agent314: `apropos` may help. searches for man pages
Mar 06 03:47:17 <yziquel75>	katia rbox solved. it was a cpu bug. https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/14989
Mar 06 03:47:43 <agent314>	pedrowiski: if youre new to cisco i'd recommend "Cisco Routers for the Desperate Router and Switch Management"
Mar 06 03:47:53 <agent314>	*Cisco Routers for the Desperate
Mar 06 03:47:58 <rbox>	so nothign to do with the magical hp kernel
Mar 06 03:48:35 <agent314>	it's only 147 pages and it's written in a very easy to read but informative style
Mar 06 03:50:03 <agent314>	i also have absolutely no PDFs of those books, do not dm me because i will not share them with you
Mar 06 03:50:10 <pedrowiski>	agent314: is that actually the books name? Lel most of the times I just need to know if the router went online or not when I plug a internet cable to it
Mar 06 03:50:30 <agent314>	pedrowiski: https://www.amazon.com/Cisco-Routers-Desperate-2nd-Management-ebook/dp/B002MZAR7C
Mar 06 03:51:14 <agent314>	pedrowiski: actually a more approriate link is probably https://nostarch.com/cisco-routers-desperate-2nd-edition
Mar 06 03:51:25 <agent314>	it's no starch press they got weird names
Mar 06 03:55:09 <agent314>	pedrowiski: if you are going to be anywhere near like administering or troubleshooting cisco, i'd highly recommend learning its CLI
Mar 06 03:55:52 <agent314>	there's web interface sometimes but unlike, say, OpenWRT it totally sucks and is an afterthought usually
Mar 06 03:57:38 <agent314>	IOS has a really really good command line interface, it's very different from linux or windows and it's very complex and very very good
Mar 06 04:00:45 <agent314>	pedrowiski: anyway stop by #cisco, i'm usually there, we'll help you setup packet tracer or GNS3 if you want to practice with virtual cisco devices or with real devices
Mar 06 04:01:34 <agent314>	just list what your device is and what your IOS version is and whether you're on hardware or simulated because in cisco one the difference between 3560 and 3560CX is ENORMOUS
Mar 06 04:02:05 <agent314>	*cisco the difference
Mar 06 04:02:49 <JanC>	agent314: can I suggest IOS isn't linux and thus not relevant here?  :)
Mar 06 04:02:53 <agent314>	oooh new book from no starch https://nostarch.com/introduction-system-programming-linux
Mar 06 04:05:06 <agent314>	see again, just looking at its table of contents i feel like it's not going to the depth required for realistic stuff
Mar 06 04:06:44 <agent314>	like that doesn't look to me like "system programming"
Mar 06 04:09:15 <agent314>	i want to see chapters like "how to make your own window manager", "how add a new feature to LUKS", "difference between kernel 6.1 and 6.6 for programmers"
Mar 06 04:13:04 <agent314>	what would be absolute SWEET would be taking a real project like KDE, or VLC or Quassel or linux kernel itself and describing it from programmers perspective -- a map to the file structure of the project, what dependencies it needs and why, what procedure it goes through on startup, what threads it spawns and what they are doing, what the network lifecycle of it is: what it's sending out and what it's accepting, etc
Mar 06 04:14:00 <agent314>	*absolutely
Mar 06 04:21:49 <User_x86_>	hi
Mar 06 04:22:09 <User_x86_>	linux mint is cool
Mar 06 04:22:17 <rbox>	User_x86_: thanks for letting us know
Mar 06 04:22:27 <User_x86_>	i like it a lot
Mar 06 04:23:06 <rbox>	like jim carrey
Mar 06 04:23:31 <agent314>	JanC: sorry ^_^ we did take it outsid.. i mean to #cisco
Mar 06 04:23:35 <User_x86_>	hi jim carrey, i'm candis
Mar 06 04:23:56 <agent314>	User_x86_: how cool is it? can i use it cool down my soda?
Mar 06 04:24:07 <swift110-mobile>	Linux is cool
Mar 06 04:24:26 <User_x86_>	o hi. more ppl
Mar 06 04:24:33 <swift110-mobile>	Yes
Mar 06 04:24:46 <User_x86_>	im used to the channels being dead
Mar 06 04:24:48 <pedrowiski>	Linux school
Mar 06 04:24:52 <agent314>	i need actual numbers guys, by how many degrees can it lower the T of m my can of soda in 20 minutes?
Mar 06 04:25:11 <agent314>	also User_x86_ have you considered upgrading to User_x86_64?
Mar 06 04:25:25 <User_x86_>	with wat. water cooling or fan?
Mar 06 04:25:35 <User_x86_>	dont
Mar 06 04:25:40 <User_x86_>	its a trik
Mar 06 04:25:58 <agent314>	well you said linux is cool, what if i take my soda and shove it into a box full of linux will it cool the soda down?
Mar 06 04:26:11 <User_x86_>	yes.
Mar 06 04:26:24 <User_x86_>	very fast too
Mar 06 04:26:28 <pedrowiski>	The important thing is getting your ass safe from microsoft
Mar 06 04:26:31 <agent314>	but would itself get hotter in the process?
Mar 06 04:26:48 <User_x86_>	but win xp?
Mar 06 04:26:57 <User_x86_>	i love it you see
Mar 06 04:27:10 <agent314>	uhm tmi
Mar 06 04:27:16 <pedrowiski>	It took me three times them locking my backup partition and hiding away the bitlocker keys, then I learned
Mar 06 04:27:38 <User_x86_>	@agent314 yes and no. do a test run with diet coce
Mar 06 04:27:58 <agent314>	because i have a box somewhere full of old ubuntu cds
Mar 06 04:28:02 <User_x86_>	@pedr off
Mar 06 04:28:18 <User_x86_>	i mean
Mar 06 04:28:20 <User_x86_>	oof
Mar 06 04:28:21 <agent314>	i got them in like 2007 when they were giving  them for free, i ordered like 50 to spread them
Mar 06 04:28:29 <agent314>	but i still have a bunch left, somewhere
Mar 06 04:28:37 <User_x86_>	good idea
Mar 06 04:28:43 <agent314>	i can perhaps use it cool my sodas down
Mar 06 04:28:51 <agent314>	*it to
Mar 06 04:29:05 <User_x86_>	gtg brb syl
Mar 06 04:29:08 <User_x86_>	idle
Mar 06 04:29:13 <swift110-mobile>	Oh wow agent314 that’s something. I started with Linux in 2010
Mar 06 04:29:29 <agent314>	User_x86_: bbye now
Mar 06 04:29:33 <swift110-mobile>	There were still cds available for free then
Mar 06 04:29:46 <agent314>	i started in like 2003
Mar 06 04:30:05 <agent314>	i was like 10 years old
Mar 06 04:30:38 <pedrowiski>	It was around 2008 for me, with Mandriva wtf
Mar 06 04:30:38 <agent314>	but yeah, i have this macbook from 2007 or 2008
Mar 06 04:30:50 <agent314>	pedrowiski: oh yeah Mandriva was a popular thing back then
Mar 06 04:30:56 <agent314>	slackware too
Mar 06 04:31:44 <SponiX>	I think that Distribution should get an award for the most name changes. It was originally "Mandrake"
Mar 06 04:31:47 <pedrowiski>	Yea, but I ended up using more ubuntu for the ease of it. now I enjoy my peace with Mint
Mar 06 04:32:02 <agent314>	i have no idea what linux it was except i think i remember "gnome" written somewhere, i was using it in home of this bearded dude who was running an ISP from his home
Mar 06 04:32:13 <agent314>	i wanted to internet
Mar 06 04:32:30 <User_x86_>	i got linix in 2016
Mar 06 04:32:45 <rbox>	SponiX: you're a mandrake
Mar 06 04:32:55 <agent314>	i'm running a combination of kali/debian and gentoo now
Mar 06 04:33:16 <agent314>	ubuntu is too much for my old thinkpads
Mar 06 04:34:29 <User_x86_>	my pc is . win 10 AME, linux mint, win 7, and linux manjaro.
Mar 06 04:34:38 <User_x86_>	4 boot
Mar 06 04:34:53 <agent314>	i ran a bunch of different distros though, i ran freebsd as my main OS at some point
Mar 06 04:34:57 <rbox>	HELLA EXTREME
Mar 06 04:35:20 <User_x86_>	thank
Mar 06 04:35:27 <pedrowiski>	I use Mint as my main OS on m2, but I'm planning on installing Artix as a secondary OS on the HDD. Because thanks Dell for the horrible thermal management, sometimes my SSD gets to hot and it shuts down
Mar 06 04:35:54 <User_x86_>	free bsd cool too
Mar 06 04:36:17 <User_x86_>	not much exp. but i still like
Mar 06 04:36:36 <agent314>	i mean, like DistroTube has noticed, after a week, your debian and my debian are two entirely different systems
Mar 06 04:37:33 <agent314>	linux allows and encourages and sometimes forces so much individual configuration and experimentation that different setups deviate heavily from each other
Mar 06 04:37:38 <r-zan>	Evening lads
Mar 06 04:37:49 <agent314>	yello
Mar 06 04:37:55 <User_x86_>	@pedrowiski put ssd in water, with mains voltage. it helps.
Mar 06 04:38:14 <User_x86_>	i know from exp
Mar 06 04:38:19 <agent314>	actually i have a confession
Mar 06 04:38:25 <User_x86_>	o no
Mar 06 04:38:28 <agent314>	sometimes when my CPU gets too hot
Mar 06 04:38:47 <agent314>	i take a towel, get it a little wet with water
Mar 06 04:38:54 <agent314>	then a butane can
Mar 06 04:39:10 <agent314>	then i pour some butane over the towel
Mar 06 04:39:13 <agent314>	and shove it under my laptop
Mar 06 04:40:02 <User_x86_>	 wow ಠ▄ಠ
Mar 06 04:40:04 <agent314>	boiling point of butane is -1 C so it comes out instantly super cold
Mar 06 04:40:16 <agent314>	propane is even better -- -40 C
Mar 06 04:40:43 <User_x86_>	CPU gonna have a long life. lol
Mar 06 04:40:50 <agent314>	i mostly do it because i'm curious whether it works
Mar 06 04:40:56 <agent314>	and it does work
Mar 06 04:41:00 <User_x86_>	cool
Mar 06 04:41:05 <User_x86_>	ima try
Mar 06 04:41:20 <agent314>	but i think rigging something with ice and salt would be better
Mar 06 04:41:30 <agent314>	butane is flammable and i dont like being on fire
Mar 06 04:41:50 <User_x86_>	SAME
Mar 06 04:42:31 <agent314>	(this sounds like i do it all the time but i've only done it two or three times out of curiosity)
Mar 06 04:42:56 <swift110-mobile>	Why would you do that?
Mar 06 04:43:03 <User_x86_>	electrocution = L + ratio
Mar 06 04:43:10 <User_x86_>	and a cool story
Mar 06 04:43:22 <agent314>	i wanted to see if it would cool it down
Mar 06 04:43:36 <User_x86_>	it was worth a try
Mar 06 04:43:51 <agent314>	i think linustips did something like that recently, or hacksmith
Mar 06 04:44:23 <agent314>	the world record cpu frequency was set by submerging cpu under liquid helium
Mar 06 04:44:38 <User_x86_>	LTT is good stuff. also HS very cool.
Mar 06 04:44:50 <agent314>	(we should probably move this discussion into #linux-offtopic i've already gotten yelled at by the ops)
Mar 06 04:45:05 <User_x86_>	ya
Mar 06 04:45:54 <User_x86_>	im at offT
Mar 06 04:49:55 <yziquel75>	rbox I do not believe in magic...
Mar 06 04:50:14 <rbox>	not even in a young girls heart?
Mar 06 04:50:24 <yziquel75>	rbox but I still do not know what modifications hp make for its kernels.
Mar 06 04:50:31 <kfrench>	Magic doesn't need you to believe in it for it to be real.
Mar 06 04:50:40 <rbox>	kfrench: but magnets, how do they work?
Mar 06 04:50:46 <kfrench>	magic
Mar 06 04:51:18 <yziquel75>	rbox don't invite me to lay my misogyny bare. please.
Mar 06 04:52:23 <rbox>	yziquel75: what
Mar 06 04:52:25 <yziquel75>	kfrench idiocy doesn't need me to believe in it either for it to be real.
Mar 06 04:52:25 <Disconsented>	Lets uh veer away from that topic thanks

Mar 06 05:21:46 <ossifrage>	ugg, this ubuntu build for the rk3588s didn't sync the filesytem on reboot and when it came back up the superblock was corrupt
Mar 06 05:22:18 <rbox>	shucks
Mar 06 05:23:33 <ossifrage>	the annoying part is that the hardware is remote and all I have is a serial console
Mar 06 05:24:03 <rbox>	double shucks
Mar 06 05:25:50 <ossifrage>	hmm I wonder if I can write the the sd card with uboot
Mar 06 05:26:33 <rbox>	only 1 way to find out
Mar 06 05:28:02 <ossifrage>	they sorta half assed the uboot implementation, no static mac, weirdly configured spi flash
Mar 06 05:30:20 <rbox>	NO STATIC MAC!?
Mar 06 05:30:21 <rbox>	the nerve
Mar 06 05:33:15 <ayecee>	it looks like sarcasm but i'm not sure what the meaning is
Mar 06 05:33:23 *	kfrench shuffles his feet on the carpet and touches rbox's laptop.
Mar 06 05:33:52 <rbox>	it's electric... boogey woogey
Mar 06 05:51:09 <ossifrage>	the annoying part is that the setting the mac address on the kernel command line is also broken
Mar 06 05:53:45 <ayecee>	how do they set the mac
Mar 06 05:54:22 <ossifrage>	I guess they expect the os to assign a random mac when they bring the interface up
Mar 06 05:54:44 <ossifrage>	or most likely they don't care
Mar 06 05:55:01 <ayecee>	neither of these seem likely
Mar 06 05:55:41 <ossifrage>	(I'm not suprised about the mac, seems pretty common with chinese SBC vendors
Mar 06 05:56:24 <ayecee>	come on man
Mar 06 05:57:02 <ossifrage>	ayecee, a proper mac cost $, why add that to your bom if the os can fake one
Mar 06 05:57:25 <ayecee>	"i don't know" would have been just as accurate without the speculation.
Mar 06 05:58:34 <ayecee>	i know there's a cost. that doesn't mean there isn't an intended mechanism for setting on.
Mar 06 05:59:00 <mlu>	I've seen sevearl cheap Chinese chips -- even those don't get random MAC addresses
Mar 06 05:59:24 <mlu>	here's what happens: they get chips from one of the big vendros ,which assign proper MAC addresses
Mar 06 06:00:02 <ayecee>	i regret participating in this conversation.
Mar 06 06:00:13 <mlu>	you wont' actually get a non-compliant situation because the default is still "good enough"
Mar 06 06:00:30 <mlu>	no,w on the other hand, you know who does assign random MACs? Apple
Mar 06 06:00:39 <mlu>	but that's done intentionally over a few OUI blocks for privacy reasons
Mar 06 06:02:29 <ossifrage>	For a hisilicon soc $dayjob had to add a kernel patch to be able to pass the MAC over the kernel command line due to a bug in the ethernet driver
Mar 06 06:03:48 <ayecee>	does $dayjob sell hardware
Mar 06 06:04:07 <ayecee>	or are they the end user of the hardware
Mar 06 06:04:15 <ossifrage>	Yeah $dayjob is a hardware company, and we have a mac address range
Mar 06 06:04:53 <ossifrage>	But we are buying SOCs (and sometimes modules) from 3rd parties
Mar 06 06:05:25 <ayecee>	the final vendor is typically responsible for acquiring and applying mac addresses, from my experience.
Mar 06 06:05:35 <no-world>	rbox magnets are strange - there are videos that show how to make magnets - theres one magnet, thats iron and you can tap on it and it'll cause all the north south tips to change and point toward the north pole - and thus become a magnet -
Mar 06 06:05:40 <ayecee>	not the ones providing the pieces
Mar 06 06:06:11 <ossifrage>	The case I'm talking about is buying a board from orangepi and being annoyed that everytime I reboot it has a different mac address
Mar 06 06:06:35 <ayecee>	yeah, that's annoying. orangepi would be the final vendor in that case, i guess.
Mar 06 06:07:16 <ayecee>	i don't know what orangepi is but the name makes me think sketch knockoff.
Mar 06 06:08:10 <ossifrage>	it isn't a bad rk3588s design, better then some and they have enough of a following that work is being done targeting their board
Mar 06 06:08:13 <ayecee>	trading on the reputation of a more well known brand.
Mar 06 06:09:01 <ossifrage>	I'm playing with it because I'm also using the rk3588s on a $dayjob design and wanted to play with someone elses hardware
Mar 06 06:10:33 <ossifrage>	It is nice to be working on an embedded project where the SOC has enough meat to not make me sad doing native compiles
Mar 06 06:12:37 <ayecee>	(hot take) like centos
Mar 06 06:15:20 <preach>	ossifrage: currently struggling with weird pic32 issues I can't find any help with, wish I knew literally anyone
Mar 06 06:16:19 <preach>	one issue is that SPI reads always have an extra byte in it, regardless of any polarity/clocking setting I've tried them all
Mar 06 06:17:14 <preach>	another one is that USB feature reports I receive from the device on a PC are always delayed by one transaction i.e. first response is always zeroes (when I never sent zeroes), then the next response is what should have been there in the first place
Mar 06 06:22:33 <ayecee>	lonely niche eh
Mar 06 06:23:21 <ayecee>	like, a particular pic32, or same issue on multple models?
Mar 06 06:23:42 <x86>	##electronics?
Mar 06 06:24:26 <mlu>	preach: you'll g et more help in ##electronics -- also need to specify which PIC32
Mar 06 06:27:32 <ayecee>	does pic32 have segmented memory? there was something distinct about pics and i can't remember of that's it.
Mar 06 06:29:40 <ayecee>	oh, harvard architecture. "separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data."
Mar 06 06:30:04 <Zewwy>	i like paths
Mar 06 06:31:44 <ossifrage>	huh, I forgot that PIC32 was MIPS based, I'm a fan of MIPS, wrote way to much ~MIPS/SIMD assembly in a previous life
Mar 06 06:32:41 <ayecee>	didn't realize that. maybe i'm thinking of the earlier pics.
Mar 06 06:34:08 <ayecee>	yup. wikipedia confirms pic32 isn't harvard.
Mar 06 06:36:01 <ayecee>	ah. was right about the segmented memory thing, though the article i'm looking at uses the term banked memory.
Mar 06 06:42:49 <ossifrage>	FFS, I reburned the sd card, booted up fine, rebooted and now the superblock/partition table is corrupt
Mar 06 06:43:43 <ossifrage>	'The filesystem size (according to the superblock) is 124903680 blocks'
Mar 06 06:43:53 <ossifrage>	'The physical size of the device is 123650560 blocks'
Mar 06 06:44:13 <ossifrage>	it was perfectly happy the first time it booted of the sd card
Mar 06 06:46:53 <ossifrage>	I burned the image card on my x86 box, then resized the partition and resized the filesystem, never had problems doing this in the past

Mar 06 07:44:04 <r-zan>	Total scrub question : On Debian with KDE, how do I make my other drives just mount on boot again? I hate having to remount and retype my password each time.
Mar 06 07:44:55 <n4dir>	r-zan: you sure can edit the file /etc/fstab ; but perhaps KDE has a way to do that in a more graphical way. I wouldn't know
Mar 06 07:47:08 <hackinghorn>	sup
Mar 06 07:47:15 <hackinghorn>	I found a sick command
Mar 06 07:47:19 <hackinghorn>	wall
Mar 06 07:47:29 <luna_>	listening to a podcast about XMPP/Jabber and waiting for the work day to start
Mar 06 07:48:28 <ZLima12>	hackinghorn: sadly most computers only have one user these days, so less fun than it might have been in the past
Mar 06 07:49:21 <luna_>	updating and reinstalling some Debian and Ubuntu
Mar 06 07:49:35 <hackinghorn>	ZLima12: yeah, I'd love to annoy every users!
Mar 06 07:50:04 <hackinghorn>	luna_: interesting, so you got a few of them
Mar 06 07:50:44 <luna_>	hackinghorn: yeah a couple
Mar 06 07:54:54 <hasp>	tilde users still use wall

Mar 06 08:16:28 <Aleshka>	all about war deals
Mar 06 08:17:19 <jim>	what are those about?

Mar 06 08:19:43 <Aleshka>	Русский Я
Mar 06 08:19:56 <Disconsented>	English only thanks.

Mar 06 08:42:39 <Sparkles>	Is it common here to get kicked for not using English in two messages in a row?
Mar 06 08:43:26 <Sparkles>	I don't feel safe here now even if English is my main.
Mar 06 08:43:43 <Aleshka>	Да пошли ты их нахуй
Mar 06 08:43:54 <Aleshka>	ACSII FOREWA

Mar 06 08:45:11 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Mar 06 08:45:12 <Disconsented>	That's what happens when you ignore ops telling you to stop >_>
Mar 06 08:45:46 <Sparkles>	Disconsented, you realize you would have to make 80% more in other places to get banned?
Mar 06 08:45:59 <Disconsented>	huh?
Mar 06 08:46:15 <Sparkles>	You banned a person who said 3 sentences no in English.
Mar 06 08:46:22 <Sparkles>	s/no/not
Mar 06 08:46:31 <Disconsented>	Our rules are pretty clear about being english only
Mar 06 08:46:57 <Sparkles>	It is not about rules but fair approach to being public and world aware.
Mar 06 08:46:59 <Disconsented>	We've also got rules about profanity, they were warned, twice, and decided to carry on after getting kicked doing both of those things again.
Mar 06 08:47:17 <jim>	maybe you could try to -help- him instead of removing his access to being helped
Mar 06 08:47:51 <Disconsented>	Then they doubled down on two of those things..
Mar 06 08:48:31 <Sparkles>	It looks like you did not give them a chance to be an identity. Sometimes some need to say anything to feel alive.
Mar 06 08:49:01 <Disconsented>	I'm sorry but no, they had plenty of chances.
Mar 06 08:49:08 <Sparkles>	3 messages?
Mar 06 08:49:17 <Sparkles>	These are plenty?
Mar 06 08:49:32 <Disconsented>	Given how they got a kick as well, yes. That is plenty.
Mar 06 08:49:36 <Sparkles>	Are we in dictatorship environment here?
Mar 06 08:49:50 <Helmholtz>	anyone here knows xmodmap? I want to map a modifier + a key to another key. For example `Ctrl+n` to `Enter`. How to declare this in xmodmap -e?
Mar 06 08:50:04 <xx>	is incus and lxd basically the same thing?
Mar 06 08:50:09 <marcopolo1>	Documentation doesnt help me when something suddently stops working and i gotta understand exactly how how the kernel works to fix the problem
Mar 06 08:50:45 <Disconsented>	What a horrible name that is >_>
Mar 06 08:50:47 <Disconsented>	https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/introduction/
Mar 06 08:50:53 <Disconsented>	> The Incus project was created by Aleksa Sarai as a community driven alternative to Canonical's LXD.
Mar 06 08:51:07 <xx>	why horrible? does it conflict with something else?
Mar 06 08:51:34 <Sparkles>	I do not see it horrible too. It sounds interesting.
Mar 06 08:52:05 <xx>	I mean, I only found out about 'gimp' being a weird name decades later, so maybe incus also means something?
Mar 06 08:52:47 <Disconsented>	https://paste.disconsented.com/upload/dRJAVd LXD is fully of relevant links
Mar 06 08:52:49 <xx>	so, I don't know whether to use lxd or incus now
Mar 06 08:52:53 <Sparkles>	Joplin sounds funny but glorious! Doesn't it?
Mar 06 08:52:58 <Disconsented>	incus has to go all the way to the bottom https://paste.disconsented.com/upload/e19Goe
Mar 06 08:53:20 <Sparkles>	Disconsented, is that an IP logger of your authorship?
Mar 06 08:53:43 <xx>	just use Tor browser to visit it
Mar 06 08:54:00 <Disconsented>	Its a microbin instance
Mar 06 08:54:02 <Disconsented>	  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mar 06 08:54:05 <Sparkles>	Nice idea. Will do. Cheers, xx.
Mar 06 08:54:07 <Disconsented>	But lets can the drama thanks
Mar 06 08:54:22 <Sparkles>	What drama?
Mar 06 08:54:27 <stenno>	omg
Mar 06 08:54:50 <stenno>	i see you are making friends everywhere, Sparkles
Mar 06 08:54:52 <xx>	I mean, it's not drama, it's helpful advice to open random links on IRC in Tor Browser
Mar 06 08:55:08 <Sparkles>	stenno, I am afraid I will be banned right now, too. I will better crawl under the tress now.
Mar 06 08:55:10 <bombastick>	that degree of paranoia is unhealthy
Mar 06 08:55:41 <bombastick>	OK if you get a personalized link in a DM, sure dont open it directly. But a public link in a channel? How can it be traced to you?
Mar 06 08:56:02 <xx>	it's not only about tracing, tor browser also has other helpful protections that your regular browser might now have
Mar 06 08:56:07 <xx>	s/now/not/
Mar 06 08:56:29 <Sparkles>	bombastick, what if it is a web client?
Mar 06 08:56:33 <Sparkles>	HTTP supports https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer
Mar 06 08:56:49 <Sparkles>	Your referrer may contain your ID in the link.
Mar 06 08:57:01 <bombastick>	Firefox for a couple of years now hides the full referrer, it only gives the base domain (eg myirc.com)
Mar 06 08:57:11 <bombastick>	(everyone is using Firefox, right?)
Mar 06 08:57:15 <xx>	Disconsented: so it's a terrible name only due to having bad SEO (for now)?
Mar 06 08:57:37 <Disconsented>	Terrible is a hyperbole but essentially yes
Mar 06 08:57:50 <bombastick>	I for one will no longer be using using discontented.com's pastebin services
Mar 06 08:58:00 <xx>	Disconsented: got it, thanks, I was worried it was something else
Mar 06 08:58:01 <Disconsented>	ohno
Mar 06 08:58:10 <Sparkles>	Is "terrible" worse than "horrible"?
Mar 06 08:58:24 <xx>	it's interchangeable as I understand it
Mar 06 08:58:37 <Sparkles>	You said "horrible" and this is not a hyperbole?
Mar 06 08:58:40 <bombastick>	I think they meant different tihngs back in the days of boomers
Mar 06 08:58:43 <marcopolo1>	Disconsented: your site doesnt work on mobile
Mar 06 08:59:01 <xx>	bombastick: are you maybe thinking of "terrific"?
Mar 06 08:59:20 <Disconsented>	works fine for me
Mar 06 08:59:21 <Disconsented>	  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mar 06 08:59:58 <bombastick>	xx: probably that too, alongside "awesome"
Mar 06 09:00:18 <bombastick>	but guys, we are drifting off-topic by #linux standards, let's get back to American politics
Mar 06 09:00:27 <Disconsented>	lol
Mar 06 09:00:35 <n4dir>	lol
Mar 06 09:03:31 <Sparkles>	stenno: it is awesome to see you here around, too. I see it an great channel to lurk but I rarely speak here. I have always felt unsafe to be in this channel.
Mar 06 09:03:38 <xx>	I'd vote for linux for president
Mar 06 09:03:52 <Sparkles>	s/an/a
Mar 06 09:17:24 <lockywolf>	Thawte used to have a Web of Trust?
Mar 06 09:18:08 <marcopolo1>	I installed lightdm but it still boots in tty? Do i need something else?
Mar 06 09:18:18 <ssm_>	Sparkles: /ignore goes a long way
Mar 06 09:18:34 <NauovT>	allo
Mar 06 09:20:51 <NauovT>	hi
Mar 06 09:24:41 <madmax>	marcopolo1, did you enable lightdm.service ?
Mar 06 09:28:04 <marcopolo1>	madmax: oh , service doesnt enable itself?
Mar 06 09:28:41 <jim>	NauovT, hi
Mar 06 09:31:21 <jim>	marcopolo1, maybe if you install a package containing lightdm, the code in the package that runs when the package is installed, will enable the service. that said, it should tell you wheter it will, in its docs
Mar 06 09:31:51 <madmax>	marcopolo1,no sudo systemctl enable lightdm
Mar 06 09:32:50 <jim>	some packages will display it as a choice, do you want to enable the service, and then it will follow through on that afterwards
Mar 06 09:33:17 <hackinghorn>	hi
Mar 06 09:33:21 <marcopolo1>	So if i want to autostart i go to .config/autostart or is there another directory?
Mar 06 09:33:39 <n4dir>	did anyone speak about .config/autostart?
Mar 06 09:34:33 <hackinghorn>	how do I ran a nodejs script with ../[..]/script-name.js . How do I kill it with the script name? I'm also editing the file with 'vim script-name.js' and I dont want to kill the vim process
Mar 06 09:34:46 <hackinghorn>	*I ran
Mar 06 09:37:02 <n4dir>	perhaps add a grep -v vim;
Mar 06 09:39:34 <lockywolf>	Where can I authenticate with a gnupg key?

Mar 06 10:17:12 <katia>	yziquel, lol, the hp kernel supports zfs?
Mar 06 10:18:56 <yziquel>	katia zfs and kernel and cpu is fine. what is NOT fine is Sapphire Rapids + ZFS + virtualisation. -> hardware cpu-level bug.
Mar 06 10:19:27 <katia>	the hp kernel supports zfs?
Mar 06 10:19:32 <katia>	just wondering :)
Mar 06 10:20:16 <yziquel>	katia the hash compute function for the merkle-like tree structure of the zfs filesystem uses an avx512f instruction, which has a hardware bug when dancing around in/out virtualisation. This triggers page faults and in the end zombies with ppid 1.
Mar 06 10:20:32 <katia>	fascinating :P
Mar 06 10:20:35 <yziquel>	katia only on Sapphire Rapids.
Mar 06 10:20:49 <katia>	only on Sapphire Rapids the hp kernel supports zfs?
Mar 06 10:21:26 <yziquel>	katia I haven't yet tried it. it seems like this is the kernel with which hp tests compliance of the hardware. that's all.
Mar 06 10:21:36 <katia>	ah
Mar 06 10:21:44 <katia>	but it doesn't support zfs does it yziquel ?
Mar 06 10:21:57 <yziquel>	katia it's a Sapphire Rapids + zfs + virtualisation issue.
Mar 06 10:22:12 <katia>	yziquel, does hp kernel support zfs?
Mar 06 10:22:19 <yziquel>	katia that hp kernel should be fine with zfs. haven't tested.
Mar 06 10:22:29 <yziquel>	katia but why the obsession ?
Mar 06 10:22:39 <katia>	i'm just curious
Mar 06 10:22:45 <katia>	it's a new variable you did not mention ;)
Mar 06 10:22:46 <yziquel>	katia haven't tested.
Mar 06 10:23:04 <yziquel>	katia I now know I face a CPU bug.
Mar 06 10:23:16 <yziquel>	not a kernel issue.
Mar 06 10:24:25 <livingbeef>	shouldn't be hard to compile to module without the offending instruction set

Mar 06 10:36:55 <yziquel>	livingbeef yeah. right.
Mar 06 10:40:08 <dust_mite>	I'm new to Linux. I'm using Mint Cinnamon 21.2 and I really like it. I have a really stupid question...what are the first commands knowledgeable uses type into the terminal after restarting a computer? i like Htop, system monitor then vpn connect.
Mar 06 10:40:46 <dust_mite>	im currious what other people type in to the terminal after a restart
Mar 06 10:40:51 <lopid>	if it was restarted from an update: uname -a
Mar 06 10:43:54 <fb`>	systemctl / journalctl if using systemd
Mar 06 10:52:53 <livingbeef>	...nothing? The system startup should do everything for me
Mar 06 10:56:50 <suid_dumpable>	dust_mite: first thing i do after restart and login is adding my private ssh keys to ssh-agent
Mar 06 10:58:19 <hackinghorn>	bombastick: lol, thanks a lot!
Mar 06 11:05:18 <dust_mite>	i seem to be having problems with firefox. sometimes the search feature doesnt work. right now the search freature on firefox on mint cinnamon is working fine. but firefox on a seperate windows 11 computer isnt working. im pretty sure im doing something wring but i dont know what. is anyone else having weird interminitnet problems witht the search feature on firefox?
Mar 06 11:06:03 <dust_mite>	i use duckduckgo on firefox on windows 11 to look up terms i see here
Mar 06 11:07:40 <djph>	dust_mite: "search feature" ?
Mar 06 11:08:14 <djph>	dust_mite: like just typing a query into the address bar?
Mar 06 11:09:56 <dust_mite>	djph, the basic thing. type in something and it brings up diffrent results it thinks you are lookinng for. the search bar thing.
Mar 06 11:10:42 <djph>	dust_mite: I just use the address bar, but hte other one -- check that the search provider is properly set
Mar 06 11:10:53 <dust_mite>	im not a troll. novice uses get on here and learn stuff from listening
Mar 06 11:12:04 <djph>	dust_mite: ... i never said you were?
Mar 06 11:12:25 <hudo__>	how can I see the actual cpu frequency on console ?
Mar 06 11:12:44 <djph>	hudo__: cat /proc/cpuinfo
Mar 06 11:12:59 <om3ga>	disable cpu governor :)
Mar 06 11:13:32 <djph>	hudo__: er ... grep "cpu MHz" /proc/cpuinfo
Mar 06 11:13:39 <suid_dumpable>	grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy*/scaling_cur_freq
Mar 06 11:13:56 <dust_mite>	if i click on the amazon or expedia or twitter x, it loads up instantly. if i type in the whole URL (im pretty surwe thats what its called) it will load the page. but the search feature somehow gets stuck and a little ball bounces back and fourth on the tab at the top of the page. it just gets stuck
Mar 06 11:14:19 <om3ga>	there is also lscpu command
Mar 06 11:14:36 <djph>	dust_mite: huh, that sounds like the search-provider is stuck/down
Mar 06 11:15:12 <dust_mite>	om3ga, if my windows computer was working i would look up that commands heh heh
Mar 06 11:15:40 <om3ga>	actual frequency depends on current load. you can install htop, it displays current frequency
Mar 06 11:16:46 <stwange>	Morning. I'm trying to use a raspberry pi 4 as a wireless hotspot using two wifis (inbuilt as the AP, dongle as the gateway). Using hostacpd. It works, but it's unstable. I'm going < 10ms ping time to the AP, < 10ms from the pi to 8.8.8.8, but pinging 8.8.8.8 using the hostspot is taking 400-500ms. Any ideas why?
Mar 06 11:16:59 <om3ga>	hwinfo --cpu | grep Hz
Mar 06 11:17:11 <om3ga>	dmidecode -t processor | grep Hz
Mar 06 11:17:21 <om3ga>	dmesg | grep Hz
Mar 06 11:18:08 <om3ga>	stwange: rpi has slow fsb
Mar 06 11:18:13 <dust_mite>	i like htop. the pause button freezes it for several seconds to help people keep up
Mar 06 11:18:46 <om3ga>	don't expect fast wifi network using it, 10MBps max
Mar 06 11:19:13 <djph>	stwange: CPU load / overheating / etc
Mar 06 11:19:27 <hudo__>	I cant see with htop the actual frequency
Mar 06 11:19:48 <om3ga>	djph: use good thermal paste, one with gold in it has highest thermal conductivity
Mar 06 11:19:53 <djph>	stwange: also, choice of frequencies for each link
Mar 06 11:19:54 <stwange>	I could probably accept 5-10MBps if the latency wasn't a killer. I'll try using a Pi5 see if it's any better, but if not, do any of you have better devices you recommend? I'd prefer something with Linux so I could eg. install tailscale or firewalling if I wanted to later
Mar 06 11:20:13 <djph>	om3ga: I'm no the one with the pi-as-hotspot with problems :)
Mar 06 11:20:16 <om3ga>	hudo__: upgrade htop, or check if this option is enabled in settings
Mar 06 11:20:42 <djph>	om3ga: huh, thought silver was the goto (but it's been /ages/ since i've read up on thermal pastes)
Mar 06 11:21:01 <om3ga>	djph: I understand, rpi is weak, I mean first models and zeroW
Mar 06 11:21:14 <dust_mite>	it updades every 2 seconds on mint. prob all linux distros do that?
Mar 06 11:21:22 <djph>	dust_mite: "what" updates?
Mar 06 11:21:33 <om3ga>	dust_mite: it can update more fast, check settings
Mar 06 11:22:30 <om3ga>	only there's no reason to update htop that fast, it will load cpu
Mar 06 11:22:36 <dust_mite>	i think lithium paste is also good. its poisonous. not the litium that supposedly makes you feel good
Mar 06 11:23:00 <dust_mite>	that white paste i think has litium in it
Mar 06 11:23:13 <om3ga>	I bought HY610, paste, works well
Mar 06 11:23:50 <om3ga>	dust_mite: not litium, probably chalk
Mar 06 11:24:14 <om3ga>	btw chalk is not the best thermal conductor
Mar 06 11:25:17 <om3ga>	anyway, who has here rare cpus? And time for the unique benchmarks?
Mar 06 11:25:24 <dust_mite>	audio amplifiers use the same paste to connect things to heat sinks. but there is no liquid cooled amps to my knowledge.
Mar 06 11:25:57 <om3ga>	here is my comparison chart: http://46.49.41.80/hint/comparison/INT.html
Mar 06 11:26:15 <om3ga>	recent apple cpus missing, but I will add m2 soon
Mar 06 11:26:20 <Gurkenglas>	top fragments %MEM between firefox and a lot of 'Isolated Web Component's. What OS-level top-variant do I want here? I'm imagining pstree, with every node annotated with the %MEM of its subtree, and showing only the nodes that have at least x% and at least x% less than their closest visible parent, with x chosen to make stdout as high as the
Mar 06 11:26:21 <Gurkenglas>	terminal
Mar 06 11:26:39 <om3ga>	amd anyone?
Mar 06 11:26:58 <om3ga>	I'm curious how good their 3nm cpus will be
Mar 06 11:28:13 <dust_mite>	AMD? or Intel?
Mar 06 11:28:24 <om3ga>	amd
Mar 06 11:28:39 <om3ga>	they will release, or maybe released already 3nm cpu
Mar 06 11:28:55 <livingbeef>	thermal paste will do very little, you need to get a proper cooler
Mar 06 11:28:58 <om3ga>	intel unfortunately not moves anywhere
Mar 06 11:29:26 <om3ga>	livingbeef: not true, of course if cooler is not strong enough to cool down this chip
Mar 06 11:30:14 <om3ga>	I have water cooling, with this hy610 paste I have 23c degree temperature here
Mar 06 11:30:22 <livingbeef>	good thermal paste will subtract 1-2 C over average one, it's not something that will save you
Mar 06 11:30:51 <om3ga>	livingbeef: well, while I agree with you, there's also speed of transmission
Mar 06 11:31:05 <paprika>	I am a bit depressed. I had a colloquium yesterday about Programming an application and i did failed a lot and said stupid things. cheer me up.
Mar 06 11:31:09 <dust_mite>	they will prob be really good. i have amd ryzen 7 4000 radeon graphics on a windows computer and i like it. its prob almost 3 yrs old and it loads in less than 1 second. the little wait a second wheel cant make a full rotation
Mar 06 11:31:14 <om3ga>	good paste helps to transmit and get rid of thermal energy fast
Mar 06 11:31:39 <dust_mite>	its build for video games.
Mar 06 11:32:24 <om3ga>	dust_mite: only hint benchmark can tell how good cpu is, it calculates quality improvements per second, for atomic data types
Mar 06 11:32:38 <livingbeef>	and I'm not saying that 2C is bad, but if the device is severely overheating, it's really not enough
Mar 06 11:33:48 <om3ga>	livingbeef: sure, but I had issue with thermal conductor, based on chalk. It acted as a thermal resistor actually :)
Mar 06 11:33:54 <om3ga>	on the laptop
Mar 06 11:34:04 <dust_mite>	heat sink. its almost hard to believe that a liquid cooled attachment on top of a cpu can beat the standard heat sink that has tons of aluminum pins sticking off it
Mar 06 11:34:36 <livingbeef>	well, sure, 2C is over average paste. If the paste is utter trash, than the benefit can be much higher
Mar 06 11:34:40 <om3ga>	dust_mite: well, with air cooler I don't had 23c degree cpu temp
Mar 06 11:37:31 <dust_mite>	my msi windows 11 laptop says the cpu is at 28C.
Mar 06 11:38:06 <om3ga>	on idle? I mean 23C with load
Mar 06 11:38:24 <djph>	dust_mite: air is a TERRIBLE thermal conductor.
Mar 06 11:39:19 <dust_mite>	on idle doing noting. CPU is at 0 to 1% and GPU is at 0%
Mar 06 11:39:53 <dust_mite>	fan 1 is 2711 rpms, fan 2 0 rpms
Mar 06 11:40:48 <om3ga>	with my recent 12 gen intel, I have more than 40C degree on idle :)
Mar 06 11:42:46 <dust_mite>	om3ga, thats prob will within tollerances. kinda makes you wonder what temp is overheating.
Mar 06 11:42:52 <djph>	dust_mite: IIRC, water is 20 or 25 times as effective of a thermal conductor as air ... so yeah, bitty heat block used in water-cooling will be better at sinking heat away from the CPU (and then huge radiator to dump as much heat as possible into the air
Mar 06 11:44:54 <dust_mite>	water is a good coolant. theres lots of variables. i think water expands by like 800 times when it becomes steam vapor.
Mar 06 11:45:53 <djph>	1600
Mar 06 11:46:00 <bombastick>	what's the "prosumer" coolant of choice?
Mar 06 11:46:09 <djph>	but if you're *boiling* your coolant off, you have other problems
Mar 06 11:46:18 <dust_mite>	if water is good enough to cool a nuclear reactor its good enough for your desktop pc
Mar 06 11:47:22 <djph>	last time I did water-cooled, it was basically antifreeze -- water + propylene glycol
Mar 06 11:47:31 <d3vil>	dust_mite: question, why car manufactures uses special liquid as well as data centers
Mar 06 11:48:25 <djph>	d3vil: cars have this fun problem of "need to work outside, in the cold"
Mar 06 11:49:47 <d3vil>	djph: not in every place on earth there is cold... correct answer is rust
Mar 06 11:50:32 <bombastick>	AI is being used to scan every minor thing now. Two brothers were visiting me, I lent one of them 1k in local currency (so he wouldn't get hit with ATM/conversion fees), saying that they can send it to me via Wise. The other brother sends me the money, and as an (optional) note writes "For Dave's debt/loan in <city>". Transfer immediately frozen, they receive an email demanding to know who Dave is,
Mar 06 11:50:33 <bombastick>	his address, and birthdate. The money is in limbo and now he has to deal with tech support.
Mar 06 11:51:11 <bombastick>	He's sent money before without issues using the same company/bank (Wise), just didnt use no-no keywords I guess
Mar 06 11:53:34 <bombastick>	I guess even before AI they might have done it with regexes
Mar 06 11:55:21 <livingbeef>	Is this a US issue? I've never heard anyone I know have an issue like this.
Mar 06 11:56:07 <livingbeef>	but I did here several americans talk about their issues with sending or withdrawing money
Mar 06 11:56:18 <livingbeef>	*hear
Mar 06 11:56:25 <xiaomiao>	KYC, it's tedious
Mar 06 11:56:31 <dust_mite>	without the optional note, there prob would have been no problem
Mar 06 11:56:38 <xiaomiao>	banks tend to overcorrect now to even avoid potential maybe future problems
Mar 06 11:56:38 <stenno>	just write 'for sexual favors' instead
Mar 06 11:57:24 <bombastick>	stenno: funny but I wouldnt want this on my social credit record
Mar 06 11:57:25 <dust_mite>	that note made the AI think you were a bookie loan shark or a drug dealer heh heh
Mar 06 11:58:05 <wantyapps>	Hallo everyone
Mar 06 11:58:08 <stenno>	social credit?
Mar 06 11:58:19 <stenno>	you in china?
Mar 06 11:58:27 <wantyapps>	Does anyone know why spamhaus keeps flagging my mail server?
Mar 06 11:58:32 <bombastick>	western countries have social credit, it's just in its starting stages
Mar 06 11:58:36 <bombastick>	(compared to China)
Mar 06 11:58:39 <wantyapps>	This is the second time this will
Mar 06 11:59:00 <bombastick>	wantyapps: listen to this : DONT SELFHOST EMAIL
Mar 06 11:59:06 <bombastick>	this is one thing you dont self-host
Mar 06 11:59:08 <wantyapps>	s/will/week
Mar 06 11:59:14 <dust_mite>	the main question is will Dave pay you back? maybe that AI isnt that stupid, looking out for you heh heh
Mar 06 11:59:19 <livingbeef>	do you have all the signature / safeguarding stuff set up?
Mar 06 11:59:37 <livingbeef>	it's not hard to do
Mar 06 11:59:44 <wantyapps>	bombastick: my server worked perfectly for quite some time now.
Mar 06 11:59:52 <wantyapps>	livingbeef: yup yup
Mar 06 11:59:57 <livingbeef>	google even has a page that scans your mail server for you and tells you whether something is wrong
Mar 06 12:00:16 <wantyapps>	They even removed me from the blacklist after I requested
Mar 06 12:00:32 <wantyapps>	livingbeef: it said everything was fine
Mar 06 12:02:21 <dust_mite>	anything that that goes through gmail is safe. but if its an email saying that dog is cool you will get dog food ads for months
Mar 06 12:02:46 <wantyapps>	dust_mite: absolutely
Mar 06 12:03:55 <dust_mite>	i removed every trace of google and chrome and facebook and meta from my windows computer
Mar 06 12:04:03 <dust_mite>	best i could
Mar 06 12:04:05 <wantyapps>	Wow!
Mar 06 12:04:28 <dust_mite>	wasnt that hard
Mar 06 12:05:05 <dust_mite>	kinda funny how im having intermittent problems with duckduckgo on firefox......weird heh heh
Mar 06 12:05:14 <Aryan>	Hi, I'm planing this partitioning setup, https://paste.rs/DyvrA.txt, would you take a look, please?
Mar 06 12:05:46 <wantyapps>	dust_mite: I don't. Describe them?
Mar 06 12:08:14 <dust_mite>	wantyapps: problems with duckduckgo on firefox? sometimes the search bar gets stuck and the tab on the top of the screen shows a little ball bouncing back and fouth like its busy. and it just does nothing. gets stuck somehow
Mar 06 12:08:42 <wantyapps>	Huh. Doesn't happen to me on arch
Mar 06 12:09:07 <wantyapps>	Try opening Firefox with debug enabled
Mar 06 12:10:23 <c4lvin>	Aah, the interwebz, where you die a hero or live long enough to be listed under an APT <random_digit>
Mar 06 12:10:43 <wantyapps>	:)
Mar 06 12:10:45 <c4lvin>	Scratch the dying part
Mar 06 12:11:59 <dust_mite>	microsoft and alphabet and meta aren't known for playing fair with free open source software. mega corps kinda like to control stuff. they dont like firefox or linux or something they cant control
Mar 06 12:13:03 <c4lvin>	Let me rephrase that “Aah,the interwebz..where you are killed as a skritkittie or live long enough to be named an APT ;P
Mar 06 12:13:05 <dust_mite>	they say your ISP prob knows more about you that any other company you deal with
Mar 06 12:13:30 <c4lvin>	One plural ISP…pffttt
Mar 06 12:13:30 <luna_>	ah APT as APT groups and not the package manager
Mar 06 12:13:34 <luna_>	my sick brain can't keep up :p
Mar 06 12:13:55 <c4lvin>	Heh, innocent luna_
Mar 06 12:14:17 <luna_>	c4lvin: nah more being sick and working at the same time so not keeping up
Mar 06 12:14:59 <wantyapps>	Do you think the problem with my mail server is that rDNS doesn't list the hostname?
Mar 06 12:15:00 <c4lvin>	What did u think luna that we ended up as packaging….oh gws on the not well thing too
Mar 06 12:15:07 <c4lvin>	lol
Mar 06 12:15:53 <c4lvin>	Although turning me self into a c4lvin.tar.gz sounds nice too
Mar 06 12:16:42 <c4lvin>	My apologies i dont know what format apt pulls files from or is it just source files
Mar 06 12:16:50 <luna_>	.deb :p
Mar 06 12:17:13 <phogg>	c4lvin: a .deb file is an ar archive that in turn contains compressed tarballs
Mar 06 12:17:20 <c4lvin>	Aah ok then c4lvin.deb when i pass on tht settlesit
Mar 06 12:19:53 <c4lvin>	phogg: i always wondered how the app named alien was able to convert .deb to rpm and rpm to .deb on the fly so easily…that explains it
Mar 06 12:20:19 <c4lvin>	Excuse me trying to fit in callin proggys a
Mar 06 12:20:28 <c4lvin>	*apps
Mar 06 12:20:53 <c4lvin>	I think i dont need to change :P
Mar 06 12:23:11 <c4lvin>	Im bored, nothing fun ever happens when im around…*sigh*
Mar 06 12:25:02 <c4lvin>	Oii, those of you lot from here, yess you is…stop packeteering at my connections…jeebuzzcrippes
Mar 06 12:25:41 <c4lvin>	Its like hunting season in here with any nekkid IP
Mar 06 12:27:29 <irc_standardnick>	Strawberry randomnly adds {Disc 1} to certain albums when I browse through it's hierarchy even though the real folders don't bear the name. I went manually through "easy tag" and updated tags to proper values, yet this problem persists. From where is the music player sourcing, this {Disc 1} extra thing in the first place; there isn't even a cue file inside to muck things up
Mar 06 12:33:17 <phogg>	irc_standardnick: many music players can interact with a cddb service. Check your configuration and/or manual.
Mar 06 12:37:32 <irc_standardnick>	phogg, I see, I scoured the whole settings panel but couldn't find anything. If nothing else, I can always find help at github
Mar 06 12:45:34 <yziquel>	How may I list the versions of the various linux modules of the running kernel ?
Mar 06 12:46:14 <ananke>	yziquel: modinfo <module>
Mar 06 12:46:39 <yziquel>	ananke and for the list of all modules and all versions ?
Mar 06 12:46:56 <phogg>	lsmod
Mar 06 12:47:03 <phogg>	to combine the two would take a little scripting
Mar 06 12:47:55 <yziquel>	phogg sigh. a TUI tool like aptitude to select a kernel based on version constraints would be cool.
Mar 06 12:48:03 <phogg>	in fact this much: lsmod | awk '{ print $1 }' | xargs modinfo
Mar 06 12:48:35 <phogg>	yziquel: why would you need to?
Mar 06 12:48:48 <phogg>	kernels ship with modules, you don't need to work backward from a module to find a kernel version
Mar 06 12:49:12 <yziquel>	phogg. yeah. I do. Because I hit a CPU bug.
Mar 06 12:49:28 <phogg>	how do you know which versions are non-buggy?
Mar 06 12:50:35 <yziquel>	phogg I require zfs >= 2.2 because zfs < 2.1.x hits a Sapphire Rapids specific bug on avx512f+vmexit page fault, which hits people having Sapphire Rapids + virtualisation + zfs < 2.2.
Mar 06 12:51:06 <yziquel>	phogg fix is in 2.2.x. 2.1.x is unpatched.
Mar 06 12:51:29 <phogg>	sounds like what you need is to look at zfs release documentation for kernels which zfs 2.2 can be applied to, then find the highest such kernel available from your package repo
Mar 06 12:51:58 <phogg>	this is not something modinfo is going to tell you
Mar 06 12:52:24 <yziquel>	phogg this is indeed something a TUI tool like aptitude should give me.
Mar 06 12:52:46 <phogg>	there's no reason to expect such a thing to exist
Mar 06 12:52:51 <phogg>	this is by far not a common problem
Mar 06 12:53:15 <phogg>	the most you would need is a dkms package for zfs
Mar 06 12:53:37 <phogg>	and, lo, I see there is one
Mar 06 12:54:00 <phogg>	but even then it would not constrain your kernel version
Mar 06 12:54:44 <phogg>	there's just no way to know which kernel version range is compatible with a module *just* by looking at the module. You have to be a developer of that module, or read enough of it and the kernel source to understand when compatibility breaks
Mar 06 12:55:29 <phogg>	given that most modules are in-kernel and the compatible version is "the current one only", there's not much call for attempting to sort this out generically
Mar 06 12:55:36 <phogg>	so, again, check zfs docs
Mar 06 12:55:41 <livingbeef>	The module should complain during compilation if the version isn't compatible
Mar 06 12:59:43 <mdogg>	yziquel: I think '/usr/lib/modules/<kernel_number>/' has an index of available modules.
Mar 06 13:00:35 <yziquel>	mdogg interesting
Mar 06 13:00:45 <swift110-mobile>	Good morning
Mar 06 13:01:02 <mdogg>	Woops - just /lib/modules/<kernel_numb3r>/
