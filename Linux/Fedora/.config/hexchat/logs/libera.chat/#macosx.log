Dec 11 18:26:57 <fris>	utterer: yes i bought those fake airpods a while back called blackpods, it was detected as legit airpods
Dec 11 18:35:35 <tearsfornations>	they seem real in almost every way
Dec 11 18:35:46 <tearsfornations>	but just won't transition from my macbook from/to my iphone
Dec 11 18:40:09 <virt>	happy monday yall
Dec 11 18:41:47 <utterer>	all i can suggest is re-pairing them then remove and re-add from icloud 
Dec 11 18:41:57 <utterer>	maybe re-add them on a different device instead of the one you did the first time
Dec 11 18:42:42 <NDPZenB0ok>	That and check the most ultimate of basics: Make sure both (or all) devices are logged into the same iCloud account.
Dec 11 18:43:23 <Cpuroast>	Apple updates should be soon
Dec 11 18:47:33 <fris>	anyon eknow how long it takes for yelp changes to get populated to apple maps app for a stores change of address
Dec 11 18:51:04 <virt>	fris: it can take FOREVER - as far as I know, a buddy changed locations about a year ago for his car repair business, they still haven't updated the address...
Dec 11 18:51:05 <cirrusbonsai>	no idea fris, and not a ton of info about it (that I could find) that is relevant.  seems like they are pushing Apple Business Connect for business listings.
Dec 11 18:52:16 <fris>	customer moved offices, googles address is updated, but not apples
Dec 11 18:54:52 <cirrusbonsai>	I read a comment in Reddit that says it "usually" updates, but can take some time.
Dec 11 18:55:02 <cirrusbonsai>	I'd imagine that also means that sometimes it doesn't update.
Dec 11 18:55:36 <MollyLucy>	who use apple maps app anyway? that's a fail imo, google maps is sooo better
Dec 11 18:56:24 <virt>	waze > google > apple
Dec 11 18:56:26 <cirrusbonsai>	wow, my company isn't even on Yelp, but our address is accurate on Apple Maps.
Dec 11 18:56:46 <utterer>	apple maps 100x better
Dec 11 18:57:06 <NDPZenB0ok>	I use Apple Maps mostly because a search I do on my iMac shows up on all my other Apple devices.
Dec 11 18:58:28 <virt>	NDPZenB0ok: yea, that is nice and easy
Dec 11 19:08:00 <Cpuroast>	everything is out as expected

Dec 11 19:30:30 <Shaun>	woof, 14.2 was fun.  the progress bar sits perfectly still for precisely long enough to convince you it's all gone horribly wrong.  
Dec 11 19:30:42 <NDPMacBook>	lol
Dec 11 19:34:08 <kevin-oculus>	can this be battery issue started messing with the screen going off a bit when it feels like it. Sometimes it works great and sometimes the screen goes out, but then you still hear sound or phone calls. If you let it rest for 1-2 minutes, it starts again.iphone 13 pro can it be battery or motherboard

Dec 11 19:47:37 <Cpuroast>	I'll do a full backup of my phone 1st
Dec 11 19:49:50 <NDPTAL85>	kevin-oculus: Yes it could be. You should take it into Apple to get it looked at.
Dec 11 19:54:29 <jaybe>	all your bandwidths during updates are belong to us
Dec 11 19:55:06 <Cpuroast>	pulling 13.6.3 at around 60MB/sec

Feb 20 15:10:20 <fris>	the launch daemoon?
Feb 20 15:11:23 <DevAntoine>	yep, kern.maxfiles has still the same value
Feb 20 15:11:48 <DevAntoine>	When I loaded the daemon I had the following warning
Feb 20 15:11:53 <DevAntoine>	Warning: Expecting a LaunchAgents path since the command was ran as user. Got LaunchDaemons instead.
Feb 20 15:11:53 <DevAntoine>	`launchctl bootstrap` is a recommended alternative
Feb 20 15:12:43 <DoYouKnow>	you have to reboot, it's executed as root
Feb 20 15:12:50 <DevAntoine>	Oh I did reboot :p
Feb 20 15:12:59 <DevAntoine>	I know it's launch script so yeah, I rebooted :p
Feb 20 15:14:01 <DoYouKnow>	did you load it as root in the shell?
Feb 20 15:14:58 <DevAntoine>	Hum, indeed I did not run the following command with root privileges
Feb 20 15:15:16 <DevAntoine>	launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.startup.sysctl.plist
Feb 20 15:17:27 <fris>	i did the launch daemon 
Feb 20 15:17:29 <fris>	09:16 am:chris@binky$ sysctl -a | grep maxfiles
Feb 20 15:17:29 <fris>	kern.maxfiles: 16777216
Feb 20 15:17:52 <DevAntoine>	ok, I understand the warning message now
Feb 20 15:18:08 <DevAntoine>	Once the command is run as root I do not have that message anymore
Feb 20 15:18:18 <fris>	i used the 1st example showed warning, then i used 2nd example which worked
Feb 20 15:18:34 <fris>	https://superuser.com/a/1679740 this one
Feb 20 15:19:10 <DevAntoine>	fris: you're using a BNC?
Feb 20 15:19:12 <fris>	kern.maxfiles: 16777216
Feb 20 15:19:12 <fris>	kern.maxfilesperproc: 524288
Feb 20 15:19:18 <fris>	matches the values in the plist
Feb 20 15:19:23 <fris>	DevAntoine: irccloud
Feb 20 15:19:41 <DevAntoine>	fris: I removed the kern.maxfilesperproc setting, you think that could be that?
Feb 20 15:19:53 <DevAntoine>	You're running Sonoma?
Feb 20 15:20:01 <fris>	i just copied the values in that url in the 2nd example
Feb 20 15:20:12 <fris>	ventura
Feb 20 15:21:05 <fris>	one with the 7 votes
Feb 20 15:21:53 <DevAntoine>	I'm not sure it works anymore on Sonoma
Feb 20 15:22:25 <DevAntoine>	But I'll test with that file I didn't use that one
Feb 20 15:23:37 <DevAntoine>	fris: comment says it doesn't work on 13.4 or newer

Feb 21 04:59:44 <wyclif>	I know I've seen it before, but I got there by accident I guess
Feb 21 05:34:15 <wyclif>	Can somebody tell me how to navigate to the "snap to grid" controls in the touchbar?
Feb 21 05:39:38 <utterer>	is it possible
Feb 21 05:42:25 <wyclif>	yes
Feb 21 05:42:40 <wyclif>	I have seen it in the touchbar before but don't know how I got there
Feb 21 05:43:14 <wyclif>	When I expand the touchbar, it's not in the top-level menu. Must be in a sub-menu somewhere, but I can't find where atm. 
Feb 21 05:45:08 <utterer>	I don't know personally, never had a Mac with a touchbar.  It just sounded like something too granular to put into the touchbar which always seemed to have top level shortcuts.  Good luck in your hunt though.
Feb 21 05:46:37 <wyclif>	Supposedly if you press Command-J a menu will popup that lets you snap to grid somehow

Feb 21 05:47:11 <wyclif>	I'm on Sonoma, maybe that's why
Feb 21 05:50:05 <wyclif>	utterer: It's not in the top level; that's why I can't find it
Feb 21 05:50:19 <somethingfishy>	wyclif: command-j and snap to grid apply to Finder.  i've never had a touch bar, so i have no idea if that means anything there
Feb 21 05:51:07 <somethingfishy>	snap to grid are used with icons on the desktop or icon view in folders
Feb 21 05:51:18 <somethingfishy>	(...in Finder windows)
Feb 21 05:51:41 <circuitbone>	There was a bug for that that shunts it all to one corner of the screen if you are experiencing something like that.
Feb 21 05:54:57 <wyclif>	No, not experiencing anything bad. It's just annoying when you open a bunch of windows and they are all unsnapped and there's a lot of wasted screenspace and you have to manually snap them to the edges 
Feb 21 05:56:18 <wyclif>	If you scroll to the very botton of the first page of this thread, here's what it looks like. And I know I've seen this in the touchbar before, I just can't for the life of me remember how I got there: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253970403?sortBy=best
Feb 21 06:04:18 <somethingfishy>	um, windows don't snap.  icons can.
Feb 21 06:04:52 <somethingfishy>	icons on the desktop or in a Finder window set to icon view (the first option in that pictured set of controls
Feb 21 06:05:29 <somethingfishy>	that screen shot looks like icons from a Finder window
Feb 21 06:18:09 <Brains>	Third-party software is required for UI windows to 'snap' to others & edges.
Feb 21 06:18:46 <Brains>	Fun fact: icon grid-snap only remains in Finder because Steve liked it.
Feb 21 06:20:08 <somethingfishy>	good.  *I* like it, too.  not that i'm at all comparable to steve jobs
Feb 21 06:22:56 <Brains>	Me three, but in the early days there was a push to dump that feature until His Arrogance stepped in.
Feb 21 06:23:08 *	CuriosTiger wanders in.
Feb 21 06:23:36 <CuriosTiger>	Brains: You've done some MBP repairs back in the day, right?
Feb 21 06:24:07 <Brains>	A significan't number thereof, over the years. iBooks & PowerBooks as well.
Feb 21 06:24:21 <CuriosTiger>	Any idea if the trackpad is interchangeable between a 2011 and mid-2012 15" MBP?
Feb 21 06:24:35 <Brains>	Did overflow work for my old AASP for a few years after I retired.
Feb 21 06:24:57 <Brains>	That I *do* know, and the answers nup, sorry.
Feb 21 06:25:05 <CuriosTiger>	I have a 2012 that has lived a hard life, and the trackpad in it feels weird. The lower left corner almost feels like the whole assembly is moving. It takes a lot of force to depress it.
Feb 21 06:25:18 <CuriosTiger>	Bummer. I have a 2011 that could've served as parts donor.
Feb 21 06:26:17 <Brains>	Sounds like the actual button is on the verge of collapsing. There's a tension screw on the underside, you could try adjusting that, or just go over to tap-to-click for everything.
Feb 21 06:26:39 <CuriosTiger>	Hrm, where is that tension screw located?
Feb 21 06:27:16 <Brains>	Bottom edge centre. IIRC both iFixit & PBMedic have vids related to it.
Feb 21 06:27:47 <CuriosTiger>	I'll check. I have to open it anyway. Just bought a NewerTech battery for it in OWC's January sale.
Feb 21 06:28:07 <CuriosTiger>	The original Apple battery still works, but currently lasts less than an hour.
Feb 21 06:28:26 <Brains>	Not bad for a decade, though.
Feb 21 06:28:28 <CuriosTiger>	Which, given that the laptop is 12 years old and has a metric ton of charge cycles, isn't bad.
Feb 21 06:28:36 <CuriosTiger>	heh, indeed.
Feb 21 06:28:39 <wyclif>	somethingfishy: OK, whatever the term is that pushes the window against the border of the screen so there's no space
Feb 21 06:28:57 <somethingfishy>	wyclif: "zoom"
Feb 21 06:29:00 <Brains>	wyclif: Get 'Rectangle'.
Feb 21 06:29:14 <somethingfishy>	option-click the green dot in the upper left
Feb 21 06:29:27 <Brains>	That's "maximize", but yeah.
Feb 21 06:29:52 <somethingfishy>	ah, true
Feb 21 06:29:55 <CuriosTiger>	Brains: I'm making this thing a garage laptop. The garage isn't ideal for laptops, humidity-wise. But it'd be great to have a laptop I can use for looking up instruction videos or just documentation, like repair manuals and such.
Feb 21 06:30:15 <Brains>	Sounds like a perfect job for a beater.
Feb 21 06:30:24 <wyclif>	somethingfishy: Well, you just inadvertently answered my question. You have to have the Finder window focussed first, then if you activate the touchbar, the "snap to grid" button is there, so thanks 
Feb 21 06:30:52 <somethingfishy>	wyclif: glad it helped you get what you were after
Feb 21 06:30:56 <wyclif>	For a few minutes there I thought I was just imagining things
Feb 21 06:31:05 <CuriosTiger>	Unpopular opinion: I kinda like the touch bar.
Feb 21 06:31:38 <Brains>	wyclif: Get 'Rectangle'. Seriously. Free, and worth it if you're one of those strange anal-retentives who like tiled/snapped window arrangements (which is most folk here, heh ;))
Feb 21 06:32:02 <CuriosTiger>	I wish MacOS had better tiling/snapping support.
Feb 21 06:32:26 <CuriosTiger>	I've explored a few third-party apps for that purpose, but never quite found anything that felt seamless.
Feb 21 06:33:13 <circuitbone>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQECSInWVPY
Feb 21 06:33:18 <Brains>	Moom is about the best of those there is, but there's quirks.
Feb 21 06:33:21 <somethingfishy>	back on my 17" MBP i wrote an applescript to clean up sizing and arrangement of safari windows.  called it "safari fix size" :-p
Feb 21 06:33:48 <circuitbone>	I wonder if someone took Steve's concept to reality. The opposing constraints? unpack them...
Feb 21 06:33:59 <CuriosTiger>	Brains: Presumably, quirks are a given in anything not integrated into the OS.
Feb 21 06:34:04 <wyclif>	Brains: Oh yeah. Looks good. Exactly what I need. The only question is: why doesn't Apple make this native functionality?
Feb 21 06:35:16 <circuitbone>	Brains:  you can read the transcript instead of skipping this time. https://youtubetranscript.com/?v=bQECSInWVPY
Feb 21 06:35:41 <somethingfishy>	wyclif: apple has their way of viewing the world, and how everyone should use their products.  if your opinion differs, you're wrong (to them).
Feb 21 06:36:06 <wyclif>	My understanding of why they never did this is because Steve thought the OS should be very opinionated about window placement, but the implementation doesn't seem great. You should be able to move a bunch of browser or app windows around, and snap them back neatly with one command natively 
Feb 21 06:36:27 <Brains>	wyclif: Because they're pointer-focused, keyboard control of the GUI is anathema to them, always has been.
Feb 21 06:37:02 <wyclif>	Brains: I think that's true; I came to macOS (BSD, really) from the Linux desktop world
Feb 21 06:37:08 <Brains>	To them, windows are like sheets of animated paper.
Feb 21 06:37:22 <Brains>	Overlap Is Good.
Feb 21 06:37:41 <circuitbone>	Steve wanted to do away with folders and files. You saw it nearly being a reality in early days of IOS.
Feb 21 06:37:50 *	Brains nods
Feb 21 06:38:03 <Brains>	And he wanted to do away with the whole CLI structure as well.
Feb 21 06:38:13 <wyclif>	Booooooo
Feb 21 06:38:19 <circuitbone>	CLI only for developer accounts. 2026
Feb 21 06:38:35 <wyclif>	They'll take away my CLI when they pry it out of my cold, dead hands!
Feb 21 06:38:41 <circuitbone>	lol
Feb 21 06:38:51 <Brains>	They're still playing with making the CLI (the 'BSD Userland' in their parlance) optional, btw.
Feb 21 06:39:19 <circuitbone>	It will be before xcode tools
Feb 21 06:41:05 <Brains>	Shifting CLI to Xcode was one method they looked at, back with Mavericks. Even got to spent five minutes on an internal alpha build that did that, Terminal existed but there as nothing local for it to talk to.
Feb 21 06:41:32 <circuitbone>	You get a terminal now in Github codespaces. I love me some electron glueing everything.
Feb 21 06:41:40 <circuitbone>	stevey was a sony weeabo if I can use nomenclature from this current generations english.  :)
Feb 21 06:41:47 <circuitbone>	weeaboo*
Feb 21 06:44:05 <circuitbone>	ios is really at ease 4.0 ;P
Feb 21 06:44:51 <Brains>	Not all that far from the truth :)
Feb 21 06:44:58 <circuitbone>	hehe
Feb 21 06:51:13 <circuitbone>	You need a developer account to use that function
Feb 21 08:15:26 <swift110-mobile>	lol
Feb 21 08:25:22 <wyclif>	circuitbone: Pretty sure a person needs a body pillow to count as a weeb 
Feb 21 08:26:26 <wyclif>	Or at least a dakimakura 
Feb 21 08:35:14 <circuitbone>	wyclif:  He `lubbed` his Sony gear. headphones and walkman jizzy
Feb 21 08:36:14 <circuitbone>	The ipad is essentially an izakaya bar ordering device. Menu and games.
Feb 21 08:37:09 <levite>	Tip calculator was the killer app 
Feb 21 08:57:24 <Brains>	Vision Pro supports Ultra Panavision 70 (2.67:1) & there's several UP70 films in Apple's library for it ... although you'll have to endure a recharging intermission for "Avengers: Endgame": https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/02/20/apple-vision-pro-natively-supports-a-rare-film-aspect-ratio
Feb 21 09:24:46 <stilicho>	hello, why are screen recordings made from QuickTime so large? A four-minute video is 218 mb. How can I compress it to a lower size while keeping it 720p? I have handbrake if that can be used.
Feb 21 09:26:39 <circuitbone>	Handbrake or ffmpeg on the command line is ok
Feb 21 09:27:01 <circuitbone>	You can find out the codec Apple uses for the original recording if you really want to dive there.
Feb 21 09:34:04 <stilicho>	used handbrake to convert it using the preset <very fast 720p30> and it gave me a 200mb mp4 file. I think 100mb for a 4min 720p video is reasonably good, right?
Feb 21 09:34:22 <stilicho>	not sure what I should differently
Feb 21 09:35:36 <circuitbone>	What is the compression going to be used for?
Feb 21 09:35:44 <circuitbone>	compressed file
Feb 21 09:36:43 <circuitbone>	You can reduce the size to around 480p/mp4, wipe out a lot of the audio , eg drop to 22khz and that will give you a smaller file.
Feb 21 09:39:35 <circuitbone>	What is the final goal with the compressed version?
Feb 21 09:39:42 <stilicho>	I've seen 720p 50 min tv episodes for 700mb that're reasonably good. I'm just saying, its not unreasonable to want a 4 min 720p video to be 100mb
Feb 21 09:40:49 <stilicho>	goal is for the compressed video to be a 720p video that's <= 100mb
Feb 21 09:42:44 <circuitbone>	Consider dropping the audio first if you are preserving the video, 480p is acceptable should you need to drop the frame size.
Feb 21 09:45:41 <stilicho>	thanks, I'll try to see if 480p is good. There is no audio since I recorded with quicktime
Feb 21 09:47:02 <circuitbone>	ok

Feb 22 00:13:16 <MacinMan>	Cpuroast: you here ?
Feb 22 00:15:34 <MacinMan>	I put Monterey back on the iMac after running reset fusion in  terminal in recovery   Sonoma was ok but I had some issues happen with my devices in iCloud. Have some strange ghosted device after logging out of iCloud in a VM that got stuck being identified as an iPhone running macOS. So I mainly went back to Monterey so when I call Apple about this, I won't have to tell them I'm running an unsupported OS.
Feb 22 00:25:03 <MacinMan>	The other thing is, when I went through the setup I accidentally didn't disable FileVault so it's on.  Doesn't seem like it's affecting how this computer is running
Feb 22 00:26:20 <MacinMan>	I usually disable FileVault but I didn't for whatever reason I didn't see the options this time. Seems like the setup process has changed since the last time I installed Monterey as in they moved things I think

Feb 22 14:11:25 <Kartagis>	MacinMan: maybe cloud?
Feb 22 14:11:40 <MacinMan>	possibly
Feb 22 14:32:06 <EgonX>	MacinMan yes it does, it may be time for a little of that here honestly
Feb 22 14:46:05 <MacinMan>	EgonX: I had done a clean install before I moved and then ran it a couple years and it got messy
Feb 22 14:46:19 <MacinMan>	So decided to start over yesterday
Feb 22 14:50:47 <EgonX>	Yeah, that seems to happen. I probably should do the same and clean up stuff that I have accumulated over the last 2 years
Feb 22 15:02:19 <NDPZenBook>	I'm taking America to YELLOW ALERT due to nationwide cellular outages.
Feb 22 15:03:01 <MacinMan>	NDPZenBook: my mom just texted me and asked if I had issues she saw it on the news
Feb 22 15:14:18 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to cirrusbonsai
Feb 22 15:15:38 <cirrusbonsai>	rough morning for all our customers who complained that they didn't want to use an auth app for MFA and used SMS instead.
Feb 22 15:24:04 <NDPZenBook>	cirrusbonsai, lol
Feb 22 15:39:34 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: I actually like google authenticator. I've started using it more for my auth app
Feb 22 15:40:17 <NDPZenBook>	I use that too.
Feb 22 15:40:22 <NDPZenBook>	Make sure you backup your seeds.
Feb 22 15:40:38 <cirrusbonsai>	I split between Google Auth and MS Auth.  Both are good.
Feb 22 15:40:42 <utterer>	anyone know if a USB zip drive would work on a modern mac os without additional drivers?  I doubt it but I wonder if anyone has experimented before I buy one
Feb 22 15:41:03 <utterer>	OTP Auth has been my mfa authenticator with 1password as a backup
Feb 22 15:41:18 <NDPZenBook>	utterer, You mean one of these? https://www.ebay.com/b/Usb-Zip-Drive/169/bn_7023251474
Feb 22 15:41:18 <godSend23>	hey all
Feb 22 15:41:21 <cirrusbonsai>	like, old school ZIP drive?
Feb 22 15:41:22 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: I was going to ask if Microsoft's was good I went with google because I like their tools typically
Feb 22 15:41:36 <NDPZenBook>	I use Microsoft authenticator for somethings.
Feb 22 15:41:46 <utterer>	because both will sync on mobile and desktop and OTP Auth gives me a menubar item - i know this pretty much violates a lot of what MFA is there for but my other measures on my computer I think secure it adequately 
Feb 22 15:41:53 <cirrusbonsai>	I tend to have less trust for Google services than others, but they're fine.
Feb 22 15:42:42 <cirrusbonsai>	anyone using passkeys yet?
Feb 22 15:43:00 <utterer>	I think I accidentally moved my amazon account to one
Feb 22 15:43:01 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: actually I was probably the opposite with  the view of Microsoft as you are with google. Meaning I'd probably trust google over MS
Feb 22 15:43:57 <cirrusbonsai>	MacinMan Google scans everything you throw at it.  MS actually provides Enterprise services that adhere to most security compliance requirements.
Feb 22 15:43:58 <NDPZenBook>	Passkeys are not ready for prime time.
Feb 22 15:44:15 <NDPZenBook>	I'm giving them 3 years before I try em for anything serious.
Feb 22 15:44:23 <cirrusbonsai>	NDPZenBook I didn't think so.
Feb 22 15:44:56 <NDPZenBook>	BitWarden doesn't fully support em yet (on mobile apps). There isn't clear delination between Hardware Locked Passkeys and Ecosystem Locked Passkeys.
Feb 22 15:44:59 <MacinMan>	I might download the Microsoft one as well then and compare for myself 
Feb 22 15:45:14 <NDPZenBook>	Lots of implementations don't work properly yet.
Feb 22 15:46:24 <utterer>	macOS's built in MFA support is also pretty great too now
Feb 22 15:46:57 <MacinMan>	NDPZenBook: how is the mobile outage affecting customers? For example I've gotten my usual text messages this morning from the bank updates (non iMessage )
Feb 22 15:47:12 <NDPZenBook>	Some people have service, others don't.
Feb 22 15:47:14 <NDPZenBook>	Appears random.
Feb 22 15:47:42 <cirrusbonsai>	yeah, it's hit/miss.  many of our customers are having a hard time.  others aren't.
Feb 22 15:48:18 <utterer>	probably BGP related
Feb 22 15:48:40 <NDPZenBook>	That was the issue with Rogers up in Canada when they were down for 3 days.
Feb 22 15:48:41 <MacinMan>	BGP?
Feb 22 15:48:52 <utterer>	border gateway protocol
Feb 22 15:48:59 <MacinMan>	Oh ok
Feb 22 15:49:00 <NDPZenBook>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol
Feb 22 15:51:24 <MacinMan>	My epson scanner seems to be a real stinker, it doesn't show up  over usb until I install the driver first I think it's because apple doesn't include a driver for it maoybe
Feb 22 15:52:41 <MacinMan>	Anyway installed the software for it, and it's working now. Also use with with VueScan 
Feb 22 17:23:48 <godSend23>	hey all

Feb 22 20:07:20 <NDPZenBook>	jaybe, Hey bro, next time don't do a BGP update on ATT production systems without running it by me first. KTHXBYE!
Feb 22 20:13:23 <jaybe>	NDPZenBook: lol you know we moved to a 'live production fix' approach. that way you can see the changes!
Feb 22 20:14:52 <NDPZenBook>	jaybe, I get it but maybe having just one G4 Cube as the main BGP server isn't such a great idea. I mean it sounded like one at the time but that was when we were down 6 bottles of Tequila in some tiki hut in the Polynesian Islands. Now that I'm sober I think we should re-architect that system.
Feb 22 20:15:52 <jaybe>	our calls aren’t on that network so … 
Feb 22 20:16:12 <jaybe>	but suppose you are right; there’s an atari 5200 waiting on standby to back it up though
Feb 22 20:16:13 <NDPZenBook>	Good point.

Senior-IT-Guy: "So, you want everyone to learn how to disable their antivirus, hack our systems, remove our deployment software & sell their work-issued laptop on Craigslist?" Boss: "... Bad idea?" IT-Guy: "Bad idea."
Feb 22 21:47:48 <N0ZYC>	sounds like "security by obscurity", and we know how well that works
Feb 22 21:49:36 <N0ZYC>	"they won't mess up the computers as long as we never teach them how to use them"
Feb 22 21:50:42 <gothkat>	Yeah. I’d be looking at replacing the IT guy. 
Feb 22 22:00:00 <jaybe>	"the command line" would need to be defined()
Feb 22 22:00:24 <jaybe>	surely was intended as and for silliness Brains ;)
Feb 22 22:06:20 <Brains>	Apparently it wasn't, and the rest of the convo was about exactly what software tools they need to use on their work-issued machines to do their jobs, and 99% of *those* didn't need anything more than Office.
Feb 22 22:08:48 <jaybe>	yah? ok? sounds normal/reasonable.?
Feb 22 22:40:21 <Brains>	She'll be right mate. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GG93DEFasAAp72u.jpg
Feb 22 23:15:24 <nebiros>	Brains: Bandit FTFW
Feb 22 23:48:31 <EtherNet>	I am having issues trying to login/change password/recovery password on the iPhone, anyone else experiencing same issue?
Feb 22 23:49:24 <Brains>	If you're in the USA, leave it until tomorrow - the nation's cellular networks are in major disarray at the moment.
Feb 22 23:49:31 <EtherNet>	ohh!
Feb 22 23:49:33 <EtherNet>	I am in Europe
Feb 22 23:49:38 <EtherNet>	but it's probably something related to that
Feb 22 23:49:40 <EtherNet>	thanks for the information
Feb 22 23:50:19 <Brains>	Could be. I've seen other reports this morning that logging into iCloud isn't working for some people.
Feb 22 23:50:50 <Brains>	Best advice is "Try again later."
Feb 22 23:50:53 <EtherNet>	yeah
Feb 22 23:50:55 <EtherNet>	I'll try tomorrow
Feb 22 23:51:33 <EtherNet>	it seems to be very slow when trying to connect to authorization servers, some stuff that has to download from iCloud, etc.. in all devices I have on the apple ecosystem, tried both fiber connection and 4g/5g so .. yeah if they had issues on USA may be affecting europe as well
Feb 22 23:52:45 <Brains>	Wouldn't surprise me.
Feb 22 23:53:24 <NDPMacBook>	LOL https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ax8vz6/who_has_been_told_today_you_need_to_get_with_att/
Feb 22 23:54:00 <gothkat>	What's going on in the US? Is it cellular specific? I'm seeing issues reaching a couple of our servers, but no info from the providers. 
Feb 22 23:54:02 <NDPMacBook>	EtherNet: Yes AT&T in the US is having a major cock up. Its 75% resolved now but probably won't be 100% till tomorrow afternoon.
Feb 22 23:54:37 <NDPMacBook>	EtherNet: Is your iPhone (and you) a US based iPhone? If so you may also need to use a VPN to authenticate.
Feb 22 23:55:29 <EtherNet>	NDPMacBook thanks for the info, iPhone is from USA, but I am on Europe, probably it's related since I will wait until tomorrow and see how it goes
Feb 23 00:06:37 <Brains>	Seeing multiple reports of both iCloud & App Store access problems over on MacAdmins, and not just from Nth Americans either. And of course FruitCo's status page is its usual greens-across-the-board uselessness.
Feb 23 00:10:59 <NDPMacBook>	Moon Landing Tonight @ 6:24 EST (14 minutes from now) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg2ffigGcYM

Feb 23 00:29:27 <NDPMacBook>	Well damn https://radar.cloudflare.com/as7018
Feb 23 00:32:19 <Brains>	EtherNet: Status now shows "resolved" & green - try again now.
Feb 23 00:34:39 <EtherNet>	Brains exactly, i just tried and it's working now!
Feb 23 00:34:47 <EtherNet>	so it was 100% related to that
Feb 23 00:35:32 <Brains>	schweeet.
Feb 23 00:36:35 <Brains>	... aaaand it looks like Intuitive has "lost" their lunar lander, there's been no contact with the craft since just before it was meant to report it had touched down.
Feb 23 00:38:12 <EtherNet>	they received signal
Feb 23 00:38:16 <EtherNet>	i just heard "welcome to the moon"
Feb 23 00:38:50 <EtherNet>	at least touchdown confirmed, we will see if they can recover control
Feb 23 00:39:10 <NDPMacBook>	EtherNet: Glad you got it working.
Feb 23 00:39:16 <EtherNet>	NDPMacBook yeah! thank you 
Feb 23 00:39:22 <NDPMacBook>	Why did you need password recovery? Do you not use a password manager?
Feb 23 00:40:25 <EtherNet>	NDPMacBook it just showed me a popup saying "some apps need you to re-authorize" or kinda... then I tried and I thought I forgot the password, so I said.. okey time to "recover passwd", and then it was failing due to this outage
Feb 23 00:41:09 <NDPMacBook>	EtherNet: Ok. Well I still recommend you start using a password manager. I recommend BitWarden.
Feb 23 00:41:20 <EtherNet>	yeah I should
Feb 23 00:41:22 <EtherNet>	indeed
Feb 23 00:42:42 <NDPMacBook>	iCloud / Google / Microsoft / passwords you really can't afford to lose. And 2 factor recovery codes...etc.
Feb 23 00:44:35 <Brains>	You've got to have a trained mind to remember lots of strong, regularly-changed passwords like I do :)
Feb 23 00:45:11 <NDPMacBook>	All the training in the world can't make up for a stroke/annerusim/hardening of the arteries....etc.

Feb 23 00:54:17 <tux0r>	engadget was good once
Feb 23 00:56:18 <nebiros>	vice wasn't that bad, lots of good documentaries and investigations IMHO
Feb 23 00:57:07 <nebiros>	shift to social channels means chatgpt fake articles?
Feb 23 00:57:09 <nebiros>	lol
Feb 23 00:57:39 <NDPMacBook>	Probably
Feb 23 02:10:52 <Brains>	So, that AT&T outage that frustrated people earlier? Seems we have a culprit: a massive Category X6.3 solar flare late yesterday, with Earth currently perched in a 'Parker spiral' of magnetic flux lines linking us to the Sun. https://spaceweather.com/ https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GG-75WDaQAABpQ7.jpg
Feb 23 02:18:19 <Shaun>	don't you hate when a solar flare hits ... one company
Feb 23 02:28:25 <Brains>	Wasn't just AT&T. Reports of other issues with 'net & comms are appearing from around the globe, things started going weird as the dawn terminator rolled by.

Feb 23 15:53:09 <maccampus>	it's noy input, it's output

Feb 23 16:14:08 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to rorx
Feb 23 16:14:31 <MacinMan>	I'm going through my TM backup for the last final touches for restoring things
Feb 23 16:30:21 <maccampus>	gamecontroller = input, laser gun = output, laserdot on tv = input, how this input is read is a good question as the TV/monitor is also an output device. Howver a laserdot on a target suit then the target suits provides input somehow, wireless (maybe BT or wifi)
Feb 23 17:11:48 <MacinMan>	NDPMacBook: you use Bitwarden right ?
Feb 23 17:12:07 <NDPTAL85>	Yup
Feb 23 17:13:05 <MacinMan>	NDPTAL85: I have a weird issue and it seems to be a known issue I restored my system to a clean install of Monterey and when I went to open Bitwarden to set it up it load with a black and white screen with nothing there
Feb 23 17:13:13 <MacinMan>	Has that happened to you recently
Feb 23 17:13:47 <NDPTAL85>	Well I haven't restored my system. 
Feb 23 17:13:58 <NDPTAL85>	In any case my Bitwarden is working fine. Which Bitwarden component were you using?
Feb 23 17:14:14 <MacinMan>	The desktop app from the app store
Feb 23 17:14:33 <MacinMan>	There are reports on their GitHub page of this issue
Feb 23 17:14:58 <MacinMan>	But it's for windows but it's the same issue on the mac
Feb 23 17:17:38 <MacinMan>	NDPTAL85: here is a screenshot I uploaded to Flickr of what it's doing on a brand new instal of the os and Bitwarden https://flic.kr/p/2pzHxTD
Feb 23 17:22:16 <MacinMan>	Just opened the iOS app and it's fine. 
Feb 23 17:22:26 <MacinMan>	So looks to be an issue with the Mac app
Feb 23 17:23:54 <NDPMacBook>	I just opened mine and its working fine.
Feb 23 17:24:21 <MacinMan>	Well I tried uninstall and reinstall same thing
Feb 23 17:24:54 <MacinMan>	When I reinstalled the os I accepted the defaults and it turned on FileVault would this affect Bitwarden ?
Feb 23 17:25:08 <NDPMacBook>	Nope not at all.
Feb 23 17:25:14 <NDPMacBook>	Were you not using Filevault before?
Feb 23 17:25:18 <NDPMacBook>	You should always have that on.
Feb 23 17:25:49 <MacinMan>	I didn't because I was always told if you don't need it leave it off because of the performance hit
Feb 23 17:26:10 <NDPMacBook>	Do you not have a SSD?
Feb 23 17:26:28 <MacinMan>	Fusion drive part  SSD and part HDD
Feb 23 17:26:37 <NDPMacBook>	I have the same on my iMac. Its fine.
Feb 23 17:27:02 <MacinMan>	Yeah it seems ok here too
Feb 23 17:27:26 <MacinMan>	But since I hadn't used it for the most part I wasn't sure if it was known to cause issues with anything
Feb 23 17:28:03 <MacinMan>	I'll brb going to try a reboot see if maybe something is in memory that needs to be cleared
Feb 23 17:33:55 <NDPMacBook>	I don't know how he has the problems that he has.
Feb 23 17:59:56 <MacinMan>	NDPTAL85: ok this is strange, if I start the iMac in Safe mode Bitwarden starts normally and it starts normally on my MBP with OCLP and Sonoma on it.  When I start the iMac normally I get what I showed you and I've stopped everything from starting up
Feb 23 18:00:04 <MacinMan>	So I'm not sure what's going on
Feb 23 18:04:33 <MacinMan>	Could this be a sign of the GPU failing ?  I haven't seen any other signs suggesting this
Feb 23 18:04:46 <NDPTAL85>	I seriously doubt that.
Feb 23 18:04:51 <NDPTAL85>	Otherwise it wouldn't work even in safe mode.
Feb 23 18:05:14 <MacinMan>	Well in safe mode the drives are disabled so there isn't any acceleration 
Feb 23 18:06:29 <MacinMan>	I don't know what else it could be since my configuration is pretty much what I had before trying OCLP on this iMac
Feb 23 18:07:31 <MacinMan>	NDPTAL85: that's why  I restored the iMac because I may need to call apple on another issue I had with ghosted devices that can't be manually removed from my Apple ID and I needed to be on a supported os so. They would help me
Feb 23 18:27:02 <utterer>	What was the name of that mac os 9 era FTP server?  Rumble or Rufus or something along those line
Feb 23 18:36:04 <utterer>	Rumpus!
Feb 23 18:55:46 <relipse>	no, a light gun acts like a mouse/keybaord combo
Feb 23 18:55:51 <relipse>	I have the Sinden Light gun
Feb 23 18:56:01 <relipse>	no one made drivers for mac so I was wondering if I could see raw input
Feb 23 18:56:48 <maccampus>	I have a Sinden Heavy Gun :)
Feb 23 18:57:22 <MacinMan>	Aren't light guns for games? Or is this different ?
Feb 23 18:58:17 <maccampus>	it's actualy a scanner that scans a dot on the screen
Feb 23 18:59:37 <MacinMan>	NDPTAL85: what all does safe mode disable ? It disables launch agents and daemons too right ?
Feb 23 19:00:17 <MacinMan>	I'm trying to figure out if I installed something that may be causing this strange conflict 
Feb 23 19:00:55 <maccampus>	make a new user then instaal them one by one
Feb 23 19:01:11 <MacinMan>	This isn't user based these are system wide
Feb 23 19:01:22 <MacinMan>	They're in /Library
Feb 23 19:01:31 <maccampus>	you can move them
Feb 23 19:04:10 <MacinMan>	maccampus: it's strange I went to reconfigure the desktop Bitwarden app and it loads with a funky black and white pattern instead of the login but when I boot into safe mode it works
Feb 23 20:00:53 <NDPMacBook>	I just now found out you can hide specific photos in Photos and require Biometrics to view them.
Feb 23 21:07:36 <fris>	NDPMacBook: ya all hidden require face id unlock
Feb 23 21:07:53 <fris>	not on folder ios though, if you hide you dont need unlock for that
Feb 23 21:07:57 <fris>	older
Feb 23 21:12:53 <Brains>	Ahoy-hoy.
Feb 23 21:13:34 <NDPTAL85>	fris: My hidden folder on my iPhone requires biometrics.
Feb 23 21:14:25 <fris>	What iOS version
Feb 23 21:14:52 <fris>	I know with iOS 13 it did t
Feb 23 21:15:15 <NDPTAL85>	17.3.1
Feb 23 21:16:12 <NDPTAL85>	My iPad is 15.8.1 and it does not require biometrics to see the hidden folder.
Feb 23 21:16:14 <NDPTAL85>	Time for a new iPad!

Feb 24 13:47:29 <AngryTom>	It has to go on
Feb 24 13:47:50 <NDPZenBook>	It went, thats how it goes.
Feb 24 13:55:57 <MacinMan>	NDPZenBook: I was never able to sort out the Bitwarden issue. I even tried it on my second install of Monterey and it still had the issue.  I'm thinking it must be a bug in this particular version either with the GPU I have, or Monterey as it worked in safe mode but not with full acceleration enabled.  So, I'll I'll just hold off installing it again for a bit. Since I mainly  just use iCloud Keychain, or Firefox / chrome sync with
Feb 24 13:55:58 <MacinMan>	 Bitwarden as a backup
Feb 24 15:14:37 <NDPZenBook>	https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1aythf0/cruise_ships_leaving_port_miami_on_a_regular/
Feb 24 15:20:31 <MacinMan>	NDPZenBook: anyway after all the time I took yesterday to troubleshoot the issue I'll still have the wait on the developers to fix the issue.  I even turned off FileVault and clean installed  just to make sure it wasn't a strange glitch but when it had the same issue on a second install of Monterey with barely any third party stuff present I figured it was something on their end. At least I tried before giving up.
Feb 24 15:22:27 <MacinMan>	So now I'm again restoring from my time machine backup but most of my important stuff is functional

Feb 25 03:19:44 <kline>	hello, do the apple trashcans have some kind of bios menu where i can control power options? i realised i had a power outage and my mac didnt turn back on automatically when the power came back. this would be really useful!
Feb 25 03:21:31 <rorx>	kline: should be in the Energy prefpane.. since EFI firmware, you pretty much have to set all these things from the OS unfortunately.
Feb 25 03:22:00 <kline>	ah, so this is perhaps not easily settable if im not actually running macos?
Feb 25 03:22:27 <rorx>	right, that's always been the supported method to do this anyhow.
Feb 25 03:22:46 <kline>	(i mean, its perfectly easily settable from linux, if i knew what efi variables and values to set, but i guess theyre not written down!)
Feb 25 03:22:54 <rorx>	it can also be set via pmset(1)

Feb 28 00:18:46 <Lordy>	they seem to be a few fries short of a happy meal 
Feb 28 00:19:24 <Lordy>	maybe they realized the target market for that already ride the short bus and don't need a car
Feb 28 00:28:14 <Shaun>	I think car's just a really weird market for them.  they're not doing bad finding 8 different ways to sell me the same computer, but the car's 99% peripheral
Feb 28 00:30:58 <Shaun>	and there's very real limits on how much different that computer can actually make to the goal of driving from A to B
Feb 28 00:31:09 <gothkat>	The car thing seemed silly. Maybe phones did too when mostly what they sold was overpriced computers?
Feb 28 00:32:12 <Shaun>	I don't think the phone was /that/ illogical, ipods outsold macs like 5:1
Feb 28 00:32:58 <Shaun>	(that said, I wasn't convinced either, because I barely used my phone at all.  it wasn't until I got an ipod touch that I realised it didn't need a phone, it needed a cellular modem)
Feb 28 00:34:50 <Shaun>	I mean if the iphone didn't make voice calls I'd almost certain didn't have one.  it's named after it's least used function.
Feb 28 00:35:17 <Shaun>	ugh, I'd almost certainly still have one.  that was an attrocity of a multi-tasked sentence.
Feb 28 00:38:01 <circuitbone>	They can revisit it when hydrogen is available. Anyone who invested in a lion car lost a lot of value, rolling chemical reaction depletion.
Feb 28 00:44:33 <gothkat>	Same, I got an iPad touch the day they were released and upgraded to the version with a modem on their release day too.
Feb 28 00:45:14 <Shaun>	it still amuses me that there was a period where the industry were all talking about the mythical "ipod-killer".  it was like an arms race to see who would figure out the garganctuan task of .. sticking a UI on a harddrive.  And then the iphone killed the ipod so quick the whole idea of killing the ipod died before it was won
Feb 28 00:46:23 <gothkat>	The iPod wasn’t even that great of a device. Not before the Touch anyway. Only the iTunes integration was worth anything, and only if you were in that ecosystem. 
Feb 28 00:47:02 <Shaun>	right, that's why no-one killed it.  everyone was trying to out-spec it, but the real fight was itms

Feb 29 14:45:50 <MacinMan>	Ok I thought it was something like that
Feb 29 14:48:00 <MacinMan>	utterer: I'm in the process of switching banks so I'm somewhat eager for this month to be over so I can make sure my transfers for direct deposit are switched over so I can close the old account
Feb 29 14:48:37 <MacinMan>	It won't be official until April but at least I can get the last payment out in march and then close it
Feb 29 14:50:29 <MacinMan>	I'm changing because the bank I've had for the last couple decades doesn't have any branches in Louisiana and has no foreseeable plans to do so.  So for checking it's just nice to have a bank to go into for stuff like depositing cash, etc
Feb 29 14:50:52 <delay>	Do you know how to make a digital signature in a pdf not modifiable or movable at all? we can edit the permissions of a pdf but I don't really need to keep track of a password
Feb 29 14:51:02 <delay>	I just don't want anyone to change the signature
Feb 29 14:51:09 <delay>	right now, people can move it around and remove it
Feb 29 14:51:25 <delay>	I've locked the document
Feb 29 14:51:45 <MacinMan>	I've never dealt with digital signatures 
Feb 29 14:51:45 <delay>	but won't people just be able to unlock it like I can?
Feb 29 14:52:02 <MacinMan>	In terms of creating one 
Feb 29 14:52:10 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to cirrusbonsai
Feb 29 14:55:27 <utterer>	i think the actual secure digital signature features for PDFs require Adobe Acrobat and the associated tools in it for the people making the PDFs and for the people signing it.

Feb 29 16:06:44 <fris>	Favourite note taking iOS app? I’m using FSNotes
Feb 29 16:08:27 <utterer>	I use the text editor "Koder" to add to some different .txt files I keep on iCloud with notes depending on topic
Feb 29 16:09:12 <MacinMan>	The main text editor I keep up with in terms of paying for is BBEdit 
Feb 29 16:09:39 <MacinMan>	For something more basic I use TextEdito, or Nano (in terminal)
Feb 29 16:09:58 <MacinMan>	Should just be TextEdit
Feb 29 16:15:25 <fris>	Don’t think BBEdit is iOS
Feb 29 16:16:13 <MacinMan>	Didn't realize this was an iOS discussion. I was talking about macOS / nix
Feb 29 16:16:15 <fris>	I like FSNotes cause has both Mac and iOS app with iCloud
Feb 29 16:16:51 <fris>	Found much easier to use than Trello
Feb 29 16:17:27 <utterer>	fsnotes is nice and full featured i am not a huge note taker on devices though. easier for me to write down the notes and move it to digital later if I have to
Feb 29 16:18:09 <MacinMan>	Are there any iPhone  Dock solutions that turn an iPhone into somewhat of a desktop?  I know a couple family members that can do this with their android phones
Feb 29 16:19:01 <MacinMan>	Especially now that the 15 series and newer have usb c
Feb 29 16:20:19 <fris>	utterer: I’m using Textastic for code editing on iOS as it integrates with working copy
Feb 29 16:27:18 <utterer>	is that a text expander?
Feb 29 16:28:02 <utterer>	I just discovered a mac app that I never knew I needed and now have become reliant on - Dropover gives a floating shelf or shelves for copy and pasting items
Feb 29 16:28:38 <utterer>	for how I work in macOS it is a complete revelation
Feb 29 16:29:40 <NDPZenBook>	Nice
Feb 29 16:29:50 <NDPZenBook>	So its basically a more robust clipboard
Feb 29 16:29:51 <NDPZenBook>	Like Windows has
Feb 29 16:30:26 <utterer>	I don't know about the windows clipboard past win 10 this reminds me of the shelves of a lot of linux window managers
Feb 29 16:30:57 <utterer>	like I can select some items on the desktop  and click+shake and then can add to the shelf or i can drag it onto the notch to add to the shelf
Feb 29 16:31:15 <utterer>	and then from there I can paste/move to wherever or it integrates with a number of cloud platforms and lets me share directly to it as well
Feb 29 16:31:31 <utterer>	https://dropoverapp.com/
Feb 29 16:32:30 <utterer>	but for a lot of tasks I need to gather files from different locations to send as one complete package so to be able to just add the items to a shelf and then drag that shelf to the final destination saves minutes per time which adds up to probably a few hours a month
Feb 29 16:55:31 <fris>	utterer: https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/textastic-code-editor/id1049254261
Feb 29 16:58:35 <utterer>	Oh got it.  The app I use may be called Koder but I just use it for note taking since it edits txt files and is free without ads lol
Feb 29 17:55:02 <philipp64>	anyone know how to add a header field (in this case, "list-id") to the ways to search a mailbox in Mail.app?
Feb 29 18:18:24 <dskull>	Q: does anyone know much about the "internet connection sharing" aspect of osx and why my device connected to it (while getting the correct ip of a website, instead tries to connect to the osx host for the delivery of a website -- thus its like everything is just going to localhost on my mac host)
Feb 29 18:25:52 <uxfi>	zippo^, hi
Feb 29 18:25:54 <uxfi>	MacinMan, hello
Feb 29 18:25:57 <uxfi>	how is ur mac man
Feb 29 19:31:31 <utterer>	does linux or windows 10 on a 2013 mac pro take advantage of both GPU's or does it just use one?
Feb 29 20:40:55 <DoYouKnow>	what's going on with macOS 15?
Feb 29 20:41:16 <MacinMan>	I don't know if anyone knows yetg
Feb 29 20:41:23 <MacinMan>	"Yet"
Feb 29 20:44:11 <Cpuroast>	DoYouKnow: you'll know at WWDC when they introduce it
Feb 29 20:44:21 <Cpuroast>	DoYouKnow: June of every year as usual
Feb 29 20:45:20 <MacinMan>	Cpuroast: the issue I had with the ghosted device on my Apple ID seems to have resolved itself.  I was going to call apple Today but it actually disappeared on it's own.
Feb 29 20:50:25 <fedorafan>	hey i have a harddrive with macos do you know how i can check the installed version on it
Feb 29 20:52:15 <MacinMan>	You could connect it to a running Mac and look at it in the startup disk prefpane it should tell you without having to boot from it
Feb 29 20:53:01 <fedorafan>	thanks but i should see it when its just mounted
Feb 29 20:53:14 <jaybe>	do tyou?
Feb 29 20:53:17 <jaybe>	do you though? 
Feb 29 20:53:29 <fedorafan>	hmm
Feb 29 20:53:37 <fedorafan>	is there a file or something that specifies the version
Feb 29 20:54:08 <jaybe>	answer
Feb 29 20:54:41 <fedorafan>	i have an idea
Feb 29 20:54:41 <MacinMan>	fedorafan: how is opening startup disk and looking at the disk any less time consuming than digging for a file with the os version?
Feb 29 20:55:10 <MacinMan>	It would be much faster
Feb 29 20:55:17 <jaybe>	they don’t want your help in actuality
Feb 29 20:55:22 <cirrusbonsai>	MacinMan's answer is probably the best.  It's like two steps.
Feb 29 20:56:28 <fedorafan>	got it
Feb 29 20:56:33 <jaybe>	good
Feb 29 20:57:16 <fedorafan>	allright
Feb 29 20:57:22 <fedorafan>	MacinMan thanks cirrusbonsai usually
Feb 29 20:57:50 <MacinMan>	On the classic Mac OS one could simply open the system folder and get info on the system file.  Current macOS isn't that easy. So glad you used the startup disk option
Feb 29 20:57:54 <jaybe>	wank-er.
Feb 29 20:58:06 <Brains>	G'day.

Mar 01 03:04:35 <Brains>	I honestly have no idea what I did, but I'm liking the 'new' Youtube video player - as in, all I get to see is the video, no ads no comments no sidebar no recommendations nada, what page UI elements are still visible don't function. It doesn't get better than this. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GHjL4GtaEAAy4vz.jpg
Mar 01 03:08:18 <Shaun>	nice.  it looks like you have a broken copy of just the right script.  So you have all the placeholder elements before the script kicks in and replaces them
Mar 01 03:08:45 <jaybe>	“A leaky database spilled 2FA codes for the world's tech giants”
Mar 01 03:09:15 <jaybe>	“A technology company that routes millions of SMS text messages across the world has secured an exposed database that was spilling one-time security codes that may have granted users’ access to their Facebook, Google and TikTok accounts.” 😬 
Mar 01 03:29:32 <Buzzlewoo>	yo
Mar 01 06:35:38 <levite>	Brains Just use youtube theater mode 
Mar 01 06:37:22 <Brains>	Why bother? I barely touch YT, I'm more likely to use invidious to download something to watch later.
Mar 01 06:41:04 <levite>	Despite the hiccups, Google gemini is really good and I don't think they have to be worried 
Mar 01 06:41:41 <levite>	Ironically this probably gives Apple a good innovative approach to not having to make their own search engine 
Mar 01 06:42:10 <levite>	They need to just focus on vision pro and gai for the next 10 years 
Mar 01 06:43:00 <levite>	Unless of course, Apple's thing becomes better than Google's thing, in which case they probably should worry 
Mar 01 13:45:13 <MacinMan>	How's it going ?

Mar 01 13:59:51 <NDPZenBook>	Yeah Nicholas Negroponte

Mar 02 14:40:14 <MacinMan>	How's it going ?
Mar 02 15:03:37 <NDPZenB00k>	https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1b36z68/had_an_interesting_interview_this_morning_where/
Mar 02 15:19:41 <Astrased>	~seen rorx
Mar 02 15:20:10 <Astrased>	hello
Mar 02 15:20:28 <Astrased>	~rorx
Mar 02 16:06:33 <utterer>	sweeeet my NAS died overnight
Mar 02 16:06:57 <MacinMan>	utterer: that doesn't sound good
Mar 02 16:07:25 <utterer>	nope looks like a hardware failure on the actual unit so the drives are still good thankfully
Mar 02 16:07:51 <MacinMan>	Is it still under warranty ?
Mar 02 16:08:06 <utterer>	Nah its like 5 years old at this point
Mar 02 16:08:23 <MacinMan>	At least it wasn't the drives
Mar 02 16:09:20 <utterer>	Yeah.  I do a monthly rsync of any changes to an external drive so i'd be ready if it was.
Mar 02 16:09:29 <kevin-oculus>	hello
Mar 02 16:09:31 <utterer>	but now to see if this is fixable or if I just need to upgrade
Mar 02 16:10:16 <kevin-oculus>	isit okay to buy an iphone 14pro with cracked back https://ibb.co/ZWdL3xd
Mar 02 16:11:56 <MacinMan>	utterer: speaking of finances my switch over for the first month to the new bank full time has gone seamless I just need to wait until April to make sure the second check goes in directly.  The first went in as expected yesterday and then I used Zelle to move the one in the old account to new.  By April both should be switched over
Mar 02 16:12:18 <utterer>	when were we speaking of finances?
Mar 02 16:12:48 <MacinMan>	utterer: I thought I mentioned I was switching banks and then you mentioned possibly needing to buy a new NAS
Mar 02 16:14:22 <utterer>	ok well glad to hear your bank moved over.
Mar 02 16:16:37 <MacinMan>	utterer: I was using BB&T (now Truist) for years then after I moved here I lost physical access to that bank because they don't exist in the entire state of Louisiana. So since I have my prime card through Chase, I moved to them for everything else too.  And I have one of those probably no more than 15 minutes away
Mar 02 16:18:37 <MacinMan>	They have a nice promo going. If you open a total checking account they will give you $300.00 for opening the account when you set up a direct deposit of $500.00 or better
Mar 02 16:18:58 <MacinMan>	Since I was able to do that with my disability I can take advantage of that
Mar 02 16:19:43 <MacinMan>	That's why I have to wait until April the government is slow in these things
Mar 02 16:19:59 <MacinMan>	Well wait until closing the old account
Mar 02 16:25:00 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to xcrorx
Mar 02 16:29:11 <utterer>	so if I solder a 100ohm resistor between two points that can get the NAS back up and running but is only a temporary patch because the LTC will keep degrading
Mar 02 16:29:33 <utterer>	may be useful for a backup
Mar 02 16:30:25 <MacinMan>	Sounds like it's worth a try
Mar 02 16:31:19 <utterer>	I have to see where the points are to solder.  I'll wait until I get a replacement and then try this hack
Mar 02 16:31:56 <MacinMan>	utterer: don't you live in NYC? Maybe Louis Rosman can fix it for you ;) 
Mar 02 16:34:15 <utterer>	I think i'll be able to do it myself and won't need a youtuber
Mar 02 16:35:04 <MacinMan>	I know but I had to pick on you. Anyway, wasn't he doing repairs before he did Youtube ?
Mar 02 16:35:25 <utterer>	i don't know anything about him other than his crybaby rants about apple's repairability
Mar 02 16:37:42 <MacinMan>	utterer: speaking of apple I'm really grateful this iMac still works like it did day one when it was new. It's just reaching end of software support from apple after Monterey is eol
Mar 02 16:40:58 <x86>	MacinMan: there's always OCLP to get newer OS's to run on that iMac if you wanted... 
Mar 02 16:42:15 <MacinMan>	x86: I know and I've done that but it's not perfect as in they haven't fixed graphics related issues that prevent 3D acceleration working in VMs so I need a supported OS still, or change to an alternative OS that I would otherwise run in a VM
Mar 02 16:43:25 <kevin-oculus>	isit okay to buy an iphone 14pro with cracked back https://ibb.co/ZWdL3xd
Mar 02 16:43:33 <MacinMan>	x86: that's the advantage of keeping an Intel Mac vs upgrading to apple silicon for backward compatibility, or cross platform compatible 
Mar 02 16:43:36 <utterer>	its your money
Mar 02 16:43:54 <x86>	ah I've not tried any VMs since OCLP'ing my EOL'ed 2012 MBP to Monterey (it was stuck at Catalina)
Mar 02 16:44:48 <x86>	I haven't tried OCLP'ing to Ventura or Sonoma, but I've not had any issues with Monterey at all... it's been fantastic
Mar 02 16:44:55 <MacinMan>	x86: for apple specific stuff OCLP is a great option but for other things it's hit or miss 
Mar 02 16:45:40 <MacinMan>	x86: I'm running Monterey as the last supported OS on this late 2015 iMac
Mar 02 16:46:54 <x86>	someone here who told me about OCLP in the first place, warned me against trying higher than Monterey with OCLP, so maybe Ventura or Sonoma works less well *shrug*
Mar 02 16:47:28 <MacinMan>	They work but they tend to have more random issues
Mar 02 16:47:58 <MacinMan>	It's because after Monterey apple started removing more stuff older Macs relied on
Mar 02 16:48:14 <MacinMan>	At least that's part of it
Mar 02 16:49:09 <MacinMan>	It's like with my late 2013, 13" MBP Monterey runs on it with no root patches necessary so all OCLP is required for is so it will boot
Mar 02 16:49:39 <MacinMan>	Ventura and Sonoma both require root patches for both my macs
Mar 02 16:51:09 <x86>	yeah same with my 2012 MBP
Mar 02 16:51:29 <x86>	well actually I think I may have needed root patches for Monterey also
Mar 02 16:52:06 <MacinMan>	x86: I think it's because unlike yours my late 2013 runs Big Sur natively 
Mar 02 16:52:25 <MacinMan>	Yours stops at Catalina right ?
Mar 02 16:52:28 <x86>	yep
Mar 02 16:58:03 <x86>	I wonder if my MBP could run Sonoma or Ventura in a VM hah
Mar 02 16:58:11 <x86>	(with Monterey as the host OS)
Mar 02 16:58:43 <MacinMan>	It should and if you enable AppleGPU in Fusion you'll get 3D accleration
Mar 02 16:59:06 <MacinMan>	That has to be done in the vmx file for the vm you need to add a couple lines to it
Mar 02 16:59:22 <x86>	one thing I did notice after OCLP'ing to Monterey is that my OS9 / SheepShaver VM would no longer run
Mar 02 16:59:44 <MacinMan>	x86: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/81657
Mar 02 16:59:53 <MacinMan>	About 3D and Apple GPU
Mar 02 16:59:59 <x86>	oh cool
Mar 02 17:00:08 <x86>	I wonder if I could just use VirtualBox though
Mar 02 17:00:19 <MacinMan>	I wouldn't
Mar 02 17:00:25 <MacinMan>	It's not as reliable
Mar 02 17:02:46 <MacinMan>	x86: I have Sonoma via OCLP running on the MBP
Mar 02 17:11:23 <MacinMan>	x86: a screenshot of my MBP on Sonoma via screen sharing: https://flic.kr/p/2pB7YVf
Mar 02 17:21:32 <MacinMan>	utterer: here is one for you, of an old camera I used to have: https://flic.kr/p/jMpn22
Mar 02 17:26:29 <MacinMan>	x86: here is another one for you, for fun of snow leopard running in a Fusion VM.  https://flic.kr/p/EotvuD
Mar 02 17:35:35 <utterer>	a collectors item.  making film for those is now a small online industry
Mar 02 17:36:26 <MacinMan>	I don't have it anymore, should I have kept it ?
Mar 02 17:42:39 <utterer>	Its not something thats worth a fortune just something you don't see much of anymore type of collectors item
Mar 02 17:43:09 <MacinMan>	Got it
Mar 02 17:43:29 <Astrased>	hi MacinMan  how are the frogs ?
Mar 02 17:43:32 <MacinMan>	Does Polaroid even still exist? I know the original company does not but does the brand name ?
Mar 02 17:43:51 <MacinMan>	Astrased: I haven't had frogs in years
Mar 02 17:44:01 <Astrased>	ah
Mar 02 17:44:11 <Astrased>	i saw pics of you and the frogs years ago
Mar 02 17:44:16 <Astrased>	was really nice
Mar 02 17:44:35 <MacinMan>	Yes those pics still exist online in places but nothing current
Mar 02 17:45:58 <MacinMan>	Several years ago, I had a Polaroid portable DVD player
Mar 02 17:46:05 <MacinMan>	It was a decent unit

Mar 03 12:48:09 <pickanick>	Hi had to replace the internal SSD in a Macbook. Installed the blank drive. Have a Time Machine backup (sadly from months back)  and also have the installer for the latest version of Monterey (2024-01 ?) .  Do I want to (a) reinstall from Time Machine (to last years' version of Monterey and then update to the latest Monterey?  Or (b) do a fresh install of newest MontereyOS and then install apps and data from Time Machine?  Will (b) work or what sort of problems can 
Mar 03 12:48:11 <pickanick>	arise?
Mar 03 13:06:01 <pickanick>	It seems that the MacOS Recovery "install over the internet" only installs the original obsolete MacOS version that came with the laptop. 
Mar 03 13:09:56 <pickanick>	ah docs promise latest compatible OS with Opt-Cmd-R 
Mar 03 13:16:55 <pickanick>	This is confusing: the Recovery mode top option is "Restore from Time Machine". which suggests I can restore to an empty disk.  Apple says "Important: You must first reinstall macOS on your Mac before you can restore your files using your Time Machine backup."  https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/recover-all-your-files-mh15638/12.0/mac/12.0   Q: which is true? 
Mar 03 13:50:20 <pickanick>	Do I need to partition a blank drive before I can use the MacOS installer?
Mar 03 13:51:43 <pickanick>	In Recovery I have chosen to Install Monterey (internet install) the dialog box says, "Choose the drive where you want to install MacOS Monterey" and there are no choices.

Mar 04 06:10:40 <Brains>	No idea why.
Mar 04 06:11:33 <Brains>	Lifted. If whomever set it complains, they'll re-do it.
Mar 04 06:13:50 <circle>	Thank you!
Mar 04 06:15:32 <circle>	How long does it take to take effect?  It still says banned
Mar 04 06:22:29 <Brains>	Should've been immediate, but Chanserv kicjbanned you again. Sorry, no idea what's up there.
Mar 04 06:23:16 <circle>	who do I message about this?

Mar 04 06:31:15 <Brains>	One of the other chanops, I guess. Lyle421, Plazma, Ziginox.
Mar 04 06:47:44 <somethingfishy>	Brains: circle: it's probably a chanserv ban, so it needs to be cleared with services
Mar 04 06:48:37 <Brains>	Beyond my meagre skills, then :)
Mar 04 06:49:50 <somethingfishy>	info is probably here: /cs help akick
Mar 04 06:56:46 *	jaybe stretches kinda
Mar 04 07:05:54 <circle>	somethingfishy: yes it appears to be chanserv ban.  "cleared with services" means channel ops have to ask Libera.chat ?
Mar 04 07:09:26 <circle>	Excuse me I may be dropping out, have to switch networks, web chat does not like that.
Mar 04 07:12:28 <gothkat>	Not so much ask, just send the right commands. 
Mar 04 07:24:26 <somethingfishy>	if they return, the answer is "no, that is not a network staff issue"

Mar 04 16:04:26 <godSend23>	sry for delay
Mar 04 16:04:52 <MacinMan>	It's ok I'm doing stuff here
Mar 04 16:25:04 <MacinMan>	How did this happen? I don't remember leaving the channel
Mar 04 16:26:16 <MacinMan>	Anyway here is the question I ask:
Mar 04 16:26:18 <MacinMan>	Hey all, a question of mostly curiosity. How long should I keep a coffee maker? Even if it's still working since most are plastic inside is there any known risks of the chemicals breaking down with the combination of heating and cooling that would eventually lead to unhealthy stuff being put into the coffee? Mine is over 5 years old at this point and still works and the coffee takes fine.  So, I was just curious if things are happening
Mar 04 16:26:18 <MacinMan>	[09:24:00]  <MacinMan>  that I might not see right away with age.
Mar 04 16:28:17 <MacinMan>	I also regularly clean it as well every few months with water / vinegar mix
Mar 04 16:38:04 <MacinMan>	I was also concerned about the longevity of the glass carafe as well even though I've treated it well
Mar 04 16:42:39 <fedorafan>	lol you got problems :D
Mar 04 16:43:03 <fedorafan>	usually as long as it just works i thought
Mar 04 16:43:56 <MacinMan>	I was a genuine question about safety why does that mean I have. Problems?
Mar 04 16:44:05 <MacinMan>	"It"
Mar 04 16:44:09 <fedorafan>	lol its fine i mean
Mar 04 16:44:16 <fedorafan>	health or safety
Mar 04 16:44:51 <cirrusbonsai>	the coffee maker is fine.  you should be more concerned about the water you use.
Mar 04 16:44:59 <fedorafan>	good point
Mar 04 16:45:41 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: how is city water here typically? And the coffee maker does have a charcoal filter 
Mar 04 16:46:18 <fedorafan>	ah
Mar 04 16:46:43 <cirrusbonsai>	I have never trusted Louisiana tap water.  it all comes from the same aquifer, but the infrastructure is old and has issues.
Mar 04 16:46:46 <fedorafan>	now i read further yeah i guess you are right with the chemicals in some degree i guess but i dont know that much about
Mar 04 16:47:32 <fedorafan>	water filter?
Mar 04 16:47:39 <fedorafan>	you also can test the water for stuff
Mar 04 16:47:56 <fedorafan>	maybe that would be a good way to see how much dirt there is in
Mar 04 16:48:17 <cirrusbonsai>	years ago bacteria was found in the water supply, and the state didn't do anything until the federal govt stepped in and threatened to cut funding.  now we get a massive dose of chlorine every month or two to kill the bacteria.
Mar 04 16:48:33 <fedorafan>	phew were there injured
Mar 04 16:48:43 <cirrusbonsai>	several people died, yes
Mar 04 16:48:51 <fedorafan>	that is very hard
Mar 04 16:49:13 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: I've noticed that as I smell that. I didn't think anything of it as Florida had the water treated too
Mar 04 16:49:32 <cirrusbonsai>	I've seen a lot of boil advisories this year, which usually means bacteria.
Mar 04 16:50:14 <cirrusbonsai>	notice the iron and calcium stains around your faucets.  it's not good water.  but it passes the federal standard, most of the time.
Mar 04 16:51:06 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: I miss living in Florida because I don't get zephyr hills spring water here and that was some of the best tasting bottled water
Mar 04 16:52:27 <fedorafan>	but yeah if you take it more serious its not that stupid to think about MacinMan
Mar 04 16:52:45 <fedorafan>	do you often use it
Mar 04 16:53:53 <davros1>	Stumbled into the apple store today, saw the M3 MacBook air
Mar 04 16:54:07 <davros1>	I'm half waiting for m3 Mac studio 
Mar 04 16:54:22 <cirrusbonsai>	MacinMan if you're worried about plastic leaching, bottled water isn't the answer.
Mar 04 16:54:39 <fedorafan>	is it a serious health problem?
Mar 04 16:54:54 <fedorafan>	i know people prefer buying glass bottles because of that
Mar 04 16:55:05 <fedorafan>	and
Mar 04 16:55:29 <fedorafan>	smooth plastic and by time it gets into the water i but not my topic
Mar 04 16:55:31 <cirrusbonsai>	plastic leaching is probably a large issue that no one really talks about.  but like most things, money talks and research suffers.
Mar 04 16:55:40 <fedorafan>	true
Mar 04 16:56:26 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: I was asking in terms of the coffee maker because of it heating and cooling I know it's a concern about water bottles too but I wasn't sure if it's as big because they usually don't get hot enough to melt 
Mar 04 16:58:10 <fedorafan>	there is a chemistry channel here on libera?
Mar 04 16:58:16 <fedorafan>	maybe those guys know more about it
Mar 04 16:58:28 <cirrusbonsai>	We live in a plastic world.  If you're concerned about your coffee maker, just get a new one.  They're cheap.  Personally, I do cold brew or french press.
Mar 04 16:58:39 <fedorafan>	wow
Mar 04 16:58:44 <fedorafan>	how do you realize that
Mar 04 17:00:05 <fedorafan>	is it done by high pressure yeah
Mar 04 17:00:16 <fedorafan>	or with a normal filter and cold water its cool i could do my own research
Mar 04 17:02:09 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: I'm not overly paranoid, no. I was mainly just asking because it's getting older and starting to show it's age more. Even though it's been well taken care o
Mar 04 17:02:35 <fedorafan>	"Leaching is a process in which plastic components come into contact with hot water and release particles into the liquid. This can cause a plastic taste in the coffee, especially if the coffee maker is not made with BPA-free components. The risk of leaching increases with the temperature of the water being used."
Mar 04 17:04:42 <cirrusbonsai>	cold brew?  it's basically like throwing a loaded french press in the refrigerator for 24 hours.  
Mar 04 17:05:10 <MacinMan>	I've had it, I like it I had it with almond milk base
Mar 04 17:05:47 <MacinMan>	It was the mocha with almond milk one I like from cold brew
Mar 04 17:06:39 <fedorafan>	ahhhh thats how its made
Mar 04 17:07:43 <fedorafan>	but french press made with hot water
Mar 04 17:07:45 <fedorafan>	lol
Mar 04 17:07:59 <fedorafan>	its really fine as you can see macin no plastic taste you are safe more or less :D
Mar 04 17:08:53 <cirrusbonsai>	yeah, the difference is that you use cold water instead of hot.  so it's less acidic.  and letting it sit for that long extracts more caffeine.
Mar 04 17:09:04 <fedorafan>	got it
Mar 04 17:09:28 <cirrusbonsai>	it's quite good.  and if you like caffeine, it's the way to go!
Mar 04 17:09:44 <fedorafan>	yeah thanks
Mar 04 17:10:08 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: I tried a pump espresso machine years ago and that was a real punch of flavor
Mar 04 17:10:25 <cirrusbonsai>	I bet!
Mar 04 17:11:05 <swift110-mobile>	Good morning
Mar 04 17:11:30 <fedorafan>	hello
Mar 04 17:11:41 <fedorafan>	does your coffee tastes plastically
Mar 04 17:12:19 <MacinMan>	Not usually so I'm probably ok in that regard
Mar 04 17:12:35 <fedorafan>	yeah i think that is a good indicator
Mar 04 17:13:16 <fedorafan>	relying on what they wrote
Mar 04 17:13:33 <fedorafan>	smell taste
Mar 04 17:13:44 <fedorafan>	yeah those always good indicators
Mar 04 17:13:49 <davros1>	Anyone got anything to say about m3 MacBook airs
Mar 04 17:14:11 <fedorafan>	oh we already got m3
Mar 04 17:17:02 <utterer>	new 13 inch form factor
Mar 04 17:17:08 <utterer>	end of the wedge era
Mar 04 17:17:27 <davros1>	I saw a 15inch one
Mar 04 17:18:20 <utterer>	the current gen mac book era design is my favorite since the original retina mbps
Mar 04 17:21:00 <MacinMan>	Based on the tech news we should have iOS 17.4 today
Mar 04 17:25:02 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: I always wondered I boil advisories applied to making coffee as the water is already boiled while brewing so it didn't make since to do it ahead of time
Mar 04 17:25:33 <cirrusbonsai>	it needs to boil for like 5 mins.  so the coffee maker is not good enough to meet the criteria.
Mar 04 17:26:38 <cirrusbonsai>	most coffee makers don't actually boil water.  they just get it hot enough.
Mar 04 17:27:09 <cirrusbonsai>	our coffee maker in the office gets it to 200°F.  not quite hot enough.
Mar 04 17:27:45 <MacinMan>	Didn't realize it had to get hotter than 100F to boil
Mar 04 17:29:07 <cirrusbonsai>	the boiling point for water is 212°F
Mar 04 17:29:24 <cirrusbonsai>	if it was 100°F we would boil every summer down here
Mar 04 17:31:49 <MacinMan>	I guess I just never knew the true boiling point of water
Mar 04 17:32:21 <MacinMan>	I always thought it was 100 maybe I was confusing it with C instead of F
Mar 04 17:32:44 <cirrusbonsai>	most likely.  212°F = 100°C
Mar 04 17:33:13 <fedorafan>	are you talking about coffee maker with those filters
Mar 04 17:33:24 <fedorafan>	now you often got these permanent filters yeah
Mar 04 17:33:29 <fedorafan>	hard to clean
Mar 04 17:35:28 <fedorafan>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce22H2-0xh4
Mar 04 17:35:41 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: the other thing is I wonder I the  advisories are for certain parts of the state only as I haven't heard a lot right here. And I would think I would if one was issued
Mar 04 17:36:56 <cirrusbonsai>	it's usually by city or parish.
Mar 04 17:37:36 <MacinMan>	Well Livingston covers my area and then there is east Baton Rouge that I would be the closest too there I think
Mar 04 17:39:49 <MacinMan>	I'm actually still learning things about this state as I go along and live here longer
Mar 04 17:40:32 <fedorafan>	:)
Mar 04 17:40:45 <fedorafan>	at the end interesting topic
Mar 04 17:41:02 *	fedorafan needs to make cold brewed coffee
Mar 04 17:41:23 <fedorafan>	didnt think about it once i drink and yeah its much more pleasant to me
Mar 04 17:41:49 <fedorafan>	MacinMan well done sorry thought its not that important but yeah it is
Mar 04 17:41:51 <fedorafan>	well
Mar 04 17:41:52 <fedorafan>	can be
Mar 04 17:42:08 <fedorafan>	spring is coming guys
Mar 04 17:42:46 <cirrusbonsai>	sunshine and mosquitos!!!

Mar 04 19:39:14 <jaybe>	good day all  o/
Mar 04 19:53:56 <highrate>	i'm tryin to back up someones picture archive (iphoto) which is large, usually over a terabyte, whats the best way to find files larger than 500 gigs, and will that work because idk if the archive is actually one file?
Mar 04 19:55:27 <jaybe>	"New M3 MacBook Air Supports Up to Two External Displays With Lid Closed"
Mar 04 19:56:17 <Cpuroast>	kind of expected
Mar 04 19:56:26 <Cpuroast>	same exact limitation as before
Mar 04 19:56:37 <Cpuroast>	an MBA with lid closed is a Mac Mini
Mar 04 20:04:58 <cirrusbonsai>	highrate the Library is one of those Package files.  It can be found in the Pictures folder.  you can right click on it and click Show Package Contents to dig into the library, but I would be cautious about making any sort of change.
Mar 04 20:05:39 <cirrusbonsai>	I don't know if something like the Grand Perspective app can search through the Library, but I would start there.
Mar 04 20:07:47 <highrate>	would it show up as 1 file if i looked for files, say, over 300 gig?
Mar 04 20:07:53 <highrate>	this is large libraries so
Mar 04 20:08:07 <highrate>	i'm all of them over 300 gig
Mar 04 20:08:20 <highrate>	actually lookin for files over 50 gig would be better
Mar 04 20:08:43 <highrate>	i havnt used macos much, so maybe a command line search would be best
Mar 04 20:09:01 <highrate>	i guess i'd have to check the macos 'find file' program
Mar 04 20:09:11 <highrate>	which i would guess is in 'finder' somewhere
Mar 04 20:24:25 <utterer>	if you show package contents of the photo library you can drag that into GrandPerspective and get a breakdown of the full library
Mar 04 20:31:04 <cirrusbonsai>	good tip, utterer 
Mar 04 20:33:20 <jaybe>	another good tip was not messing around- at all really- with the photos library. i’ve 'heard' even 'touching' (reading) and such 'changes things' … or can anyway. be very cautious. you likely can’t make a backup first to 'act upon' - so… heh
Mar 04 20:34:24 <Ferris>	Once it became a package that you can "Show Package Contents" of and not just a plain directory, I've been afraid of diving in to it
Mar 04 20:34:36 <jaybe>	wise ^
Mar 04 20:34:51 <jaybe>	it’s highly suggested to not touch it

Mar 05 16:52:19 <utterer>	its a big day for primary elections

Mar 05 19:18:29 <utterer>	my kingdom for a time based corrector
Mar 05 19:24:29 <utterer>	hmm maybe i can bypass with analog to HDMI converter
Mar 05 19:24:59 <MacinMan>	For those interested, iOS 17.4 is out today. In the process of updating now
Mar 05 19:30:45 <MacinMan>	I hate when dialogs pop up on iOS and disappear before I can read them
Mar 05 19:56:05 <MacinMan>	Apple did a strange update rollout today. They did iPad / and iOS but nothing else. I expected everything to come today since they did the RCs yesterday
Mar 05 19:57:26 <MacinMan>	Not even a security update for Monterey
Mar 05 19:57:51 <Cpuroast>	it's coming
Mar 05 19:57:57 <Cpuroast>	probably tomorrow
Mar 05 19:58:22 <MacinMan>	It's ok, it's just odd how they do things at times
Mar 05 19:59:32 <Cpuroast>	nah
Mar 05 19:59:50 <Cpuroast>	splitting up iOS/iPadOS from everything else isn't the end of the world
Mar 05 20:00:30 <Cpuroast>	or the rest will show up a bit later
Mar 05 20:00:34 <MacinMan>	Oh I know and I think they've done it before but since all the RCs came out yesterday I think it was just expected they'd do it all at once
Mar 05 20:01:15 <Cpuroast>	ah no
Mar 05 20:01:27 <Cpuroast>	iOS/iPadOS 17.4 RC came out on the 28th of Feb
Mar 05 20:01:47 <MacinMan>	Anyway when iOS updates and the phone is unlocked, does it put up a dialog with an ok button saying it was completed? I got a box pop up and then it disappeared after my phone was updated
Mar 05 20:01:54 <MacinMan>	I didn't get a chance to read it
Mar 05 20:01:54 <Cpuroast>	the rest came out on March 4th
Mar 05 20:02:22 <Cpuroast>	so iOS/iPadOS were in RC before everything else
Mar 05 20:02:41 <MacinMan>	I'm trying to figure out if that dialog was something I needed to see
Mar 05 20:03:03 <MacinMan>	And yes you're right but then I thought I heard older versions like Monterey were in RC before ios

Mar 06 20:04:55 <MacinMan>	I wasn't sure if MS added anything specific that's why I was asking. When I used it before it just seemed like chrome with a different theme and name
Mar 06 20:06:18 <Ferris>	only if you're a webdev and manually testing browsers
Mar 06 20:07:29 <MacinMan>	Ferris: I had installed it a few years ago when it first came to the Mac to try it and it didn't seem anything special so I just didn't use it much after that. After cleaning my system and starting fresh I had considered putting it back on. Although, now I don't think I need to
Mar 06 20:07:51 <MacinMan>	I have Firefox chrome and safari which I think is enough for browser coverage 
Mar 06 20:07:59 <Ferris>	yeah it's junk 
Mar 06 20:08:30 <Ferris>	rather, it's leaps and bounds better than Internet Explorer ever was, but still not necessary
Mar 06 20:09:33 <MacinMan>	Ferris: that was my other question does the new edge guarantee IE compatibility with sites that require it over the others or is IE compatibility not really an issue anymore ?
Mar 06 20:10:26 <Ferris>	Our group doesn't bother with IE anymore
Mar 06 20:10:27 <MacinMan>	I took basic web dev years ago but I'm sure what I learned is obsolete now
Mar 06 20:11:01 <Ferris>	the last time I dealt with it was at an internship and the Intranet site required IE6 and nothing else, but that was 10 years ago and it was already archaic back then for that kind of requirement
Mar 06 20:11:02 <MacinMan>	I guess the only thing that wouldn't be obsolete is the HTML code I learned
Mar 06 20:11:42 <MacinMan>	I learned to use tools like front page 2000 as I learned on windows and not the mac
Mar 06 20:14:04 <Ferris>	eek
Mar 06 20:15:09 <Ferris>	There's a small movement of webdevs who are advocating for making the web light again, no huge JS libraries sent to the client, no huge PHP backends generating (or hopefully caching) pages at each request
Mar 06 20:15:10 <MacinMan>	Well that was before I got into Mac OS X. It either had just come out was was being developed   I had a blue and white G3, or some other PPC and classic
Mar 06 20:15:33 <Ferris>	just simple HTML with a little bit of simple JS or PHP as needed
Mar 06 20:15:43 <Ferris>	no crazy CSS 
Mar 06 20:15:51 <MacinMan>	I learned simple HTML as well
Mar 06 20:16:04 <MacinMan>	That's why I was saying I doubt that part is obsolete
Mar 06 20:18:15 <Ferris>	The HTML spec has largely only expanded and not really deprecated stuff. I know <center> was all the rage for a while and that has fallen out of favor and browsers will secretly complain, but it's still supported lol
Mar 06 20:18:25 <Ferris>	for example
Mar 06 20:18:44 <jaybe>	<blink>ftw</blink>
Mar 06 20:19:35 <MacinMan>	I know the <head></head> <body></body> etc
Mar 06 20:20:49 <jaybe>	<🕸️>Hello, World!</🕸️>
Mar 06 20:21:24 <jaybe>	if one is going to get ones head involved,. the body  must also be involved ;)
Mar 06 20:21:42 <Ferris>	lol jaybe, nano did not like those webs http://midspin.net/test/center.html
Mar 06 20:22:12 *	jaybe pets its environment of utf-8-compliant goodness
Mar 06 20:22:33 <jaybe>	Ferris: i am pleased someone is using nano for irc 💥 
Mar 06 20:22:44 <MacinMan>	I remember Mac OS  x used to come with Apache, but I think they took it out right?
Mar 06 20:23:06 <Ferris>	lol not for IRC, but to make http://midspin.net/test/center.html 
Mar 06 20:23:12 <Ferris>	yeah MacinMan 
Mar 06 20:23:14 <jaybe>	ah lolol
Mar 06 20:23:32 <jaybe>	you almost earned cool points for nano-irc'ing
Mar 06 20:23:41 <Ferris>	That'd be a trick
Mar 06 20:23:49 <Ferris>	I use nano to open irc logs if that counts
Mar 06 20:23:59 <jaybe>	the points aren’t real and are often stale and smell of teenager pockets though
Mar 06 20:24:17 <jaybe>	`multitail` ftw
Mar 06 20:24:26 <Ferris>	when I was a teenager I had a walkie talkie in one pocket and a calculator in the other
Mar 06 20:24:52 <Ferris>	I hate when I'm using someone else's docker thingy and it doesn't have nano or multitail installed. are they monsters?
Mar 06 20:25:05 <jaybe>	ew cavepeople
Mar 06 20:31:46 <jaybe>	Ferris: for the toolbox and those docker bulges ~ https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2-dZ7FO7VN/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D
Mar 06 20:38:08 <Ferris>	yes 
Mar 06 20:38:13 <Ferris>	yes exactly
Mar 06 20:39:15 <Ferris>	Is this number even or odd? let me build a docker that pulls a 30mb js library and then run it in a nodejs server 
Mar 06 20:39:28 *	jaybe 🤮 
Mar 06 20:39:45 <jaybe>	i have 'no js' clauses is some contracts haha
Mar 06 20:39:47 <EgonX>	It's only not funny because it's true
Mar 06 20:39:52 <MacinMan>	Poor little jaybe ;)
Mar 06 20:40:25 <jaybe>	MacinMan: no idea what you’re referring to, but 'thanks'?
Mar 06 20:40:37 <jaybe>	poor little demntiaman lol
Mar 06 20:40:40 <MacinMan>	I was referring to your emoji
Mar 06 20:40:53 <jaybe>	vomiting about .js is nothing negative
Mar 06 20:41:00 <jaybe>	it’s a celebration of commonsense
Mar 06 20:41:06 <EgonX>	LOL
Mar 06 20:50:12 *	jaybe ℹ️ "Apple terminates Epic Games developer account, calling it a 'threat' to iOS (techcrunch.com)"
Mar 06 20:55:47 *	setnan .oO(is it a joke ? o_0 seems not)
Mar 06 20:58:14 <setnan>	(i dont have techcrunch account) ok, https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account
Mar 06 21:04:33 <MacinMan>	I'm still finding the occasional thing to update my payment info on. Think I got them all now
Mar 06 21:07:41 <MacinMan>	Question, when a debit / credit card expires in a particular month does it usually mean the end of the month? It usually doesn't give a day. Just the month / year
Mar 06 21:08:33 <Cpuroast>	does it matter?
Mar 06 21:08:45 <Cpuroast>	you usually get your replacement way before it actually experires
Mar 06 21:08:47 <Cpuroast>	expires
Mar 06 21:08:53 <MacinMan>	I ask because my old debit card I removed from payment info showed expiring soon, not expired.  Not really. I was just curious 
Mar 06 21:09:30 <MacinMan>	Cpuroast: in this case I changed banks so I entered a whole new set of card info
Mar 06 21:09:38 <Cpuroast>	right
Mar 06 21:09:42 <MacinMan>	So I'm good to go
Mar 06 21:10:42 <MacinMan>	I do have the updated card from the old bank too though, but that card will also be dead once I close that account next month once all my deposits are known to be in the new account
Mar 06 21:11:15 <NDPMacBook>	I'm in one of those cool quite pods in the Cambridge Library right now.
Mar 06 21:11:18 <MacinMan>	Zelle is a handy tool 
Mar 06 21:16:03 <MacinMan>	Cpuroast: here is a different question. Is there any reason why a single person should have multiple checking accounts? e.g. would there be any benefit for me keeping both accounts?
Mar 06 21:16:26 <swift110-mobile>	NDPMacBook: Cambridge mass or England?
Mar 06 21:16:46 <Cpuroast>	don't have to, but there's nothing inherently from with having more than 1 
Mar 06 21:17:19 <NDPMacBook>	swift110-mobile: Mass-Ah-CHOOOO-ZITZ
Mar 06 21:18:38 <swift110-mobile>	NDPMacBook: that’s cool I go to libraries in dc and will reserve rooms
Mar 06 21:19:15 <NDPMacBook>	I have to help someone via Mac Screen share so that means talking to them. Otherwise I wouldn't need a private room.
Mar 06 21:19:45 <swift110-mobile>	Understood
Mar 06 21:20:27 <swift110-mobile>	It’s a shame that even in a library quiet spaces are the exception rather than the norm
Mar 06 21:23:27 <NDPMacBook>	Well with noise cancelling headsets its not such a big deal.
Mar 06 21:23:35 <NDPMacBook>	And libraries have to evolve to survive.
Mar 06 21:23:39 <swift110-mobile>	That’s cool but it’s still annoying
Mar 06 21:23:55 <NDPMacBook>	I think its charming to hear conversations (quiet on the first floor) and toddlers running around (in their own section in the larger branches).
Mar 06 21:25:01 <swift110-mobile>	Yes it’s good to have a separate area for kids that’s for sure. It’s just that I was taught to be polite to others and not make unnecessary noise while indoors
Mar 06 21:25:26 <swift110-mobile>	So for me it’s common courtesy which sadly isn’t so common anymore
Mar 06 21:25:50 <NDPMacBook>	I hear you.
Mar 06 21:25:55 <NDPMacBook>	I'm as quiet as a church mouse most of the time.
Mar 06 21:26:09 <swift110-mobile>	That’s cool
Mar 06 21:26:57 <swift110-mobile>	Just last week I had a study room at a library and two teen girls were in the room next to me making lots of noise sitting in the dark
Mar 06 21:27:29 <swift110-mobile>	You want to hang out? Fine, but not when you are disturbing people in a study room
Mar 06 21:27:52 <MacinMan>	swift110-mobile: NDPMacBook is quiet unless frustrated then he does this: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4K7oORA_adM ;)
Mar 06 21:27:54 <NDPMacBook>	Yeah I certainly hear that.
Mar 06 21:28:14 <NDPMacBook>	MacinMan: lol
Mar 06 21:28:38 <swift110-mobile>	lol

Mar 06 22:02:23 <jaybe>	Hehe
Mar 06 22:22:51 <delay>	How retarded is the apple site? I click to change the location to change the language and it does nothing
Mar 06 22:22:53 <delay>	thanks a lot for this retardation
Mar 06 22:25:01 <delay>	I have a laptop with these configs
Mar 06 22:25:02 <delay>	2.5 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
Mar 06 22:25:06 <delay>	16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
Mar 06 22:25:12 <delay>	Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB
Mar 06 22:26:00 <delay>	Result: MacOS Sonoma is not suggested as a updated and I will need to use MacOS Monterey until the battery dies and the computer starts to frequently crash without warnings, like it happened to my previous mac
Mar 06 22:26:20 <delay>	also these batteries suck so much
Mar 06 22:26:44 <delay>	electric cars are a joke if their batteries work like mac's batteries
Mar 06 22:27:51 <delay>	I don't even know why they keep making laptops with batteries
Mar 06 22:27:54 <delay>	they last maybe 1 year
Mar 06 22:27:57 <delay>	it's a joke
Mar 06 22:28:06 <delay>	better just to always use the plug
Mar 06 22:39:23 <utterer>	i don’t think retarded is the right terminology to use
Mar 06 22:41:12 <NDPMacBook>	swift110-mobile: lol now I'm near some teens who are so loud I can hear them over my noise cancelling.
Mar 06 22:41:38 <MacinMan>	Be back later, have a good one
Mar 06 22:43:11 <Brains>	delay: Laptop batteries are fine if they're treated correctly. Unfortunately, prior to the T2 appearing that meant *not* leaving your MacBook plugged into the charger all the time. And Sonoma requires Intel+T2 as minimum.
Mar 06 22:43:39 <Brains>	You want to stay current, get rid of that Int-hell antique.
Mar 06 22:44:02 <delay>	I don't even know if I can switch to the m1 chip
Mar 06 22:44:07 <delay>	also how much does it cost
Mar 06 22:44:16 <delay>	maybe it's almost better to buy a news laptop
Mar 06 22:44:59 <Brains>	M2 MacBook Air can be had for as little as US$799 at the moment. There's only another year (maybe two) of Intel support in new macOS anyway.
Mar 06 22:45:24 <delay>	well what i would first need it to replace the battery
Mar 06 22:45:31 <delay>	how much does it cost to switch it
Mar 06 22:45:33 <Cpuroast>	Brains: I disagree, Sonoma runs on the 2019 iMac, which does not have a T2 :)
Mar 06 22:45:45 <jaybe>	hehe
Mar 06 22:45:51 <Brains>	I know, ROasty, its an exception, we're talking laptops here ;)
Mar 06 22:45:52 *	jaybe 🥁💥💦 
Mar 06 22:45:59 <Cpuroast>	Brains: ok :)
Mar 06 22:46:07 <jaybe>	Cpuroast: way to be ready though! ;)
Mar 06 22:46:13 <delay>	I also have an older macbook that sometimes suddently switches off
Mar 06 22:46:15 <delay>	any idea?
Mar 06 22:46:20 <delay>	maybe the cpu is dead?
Mar 06 22:46:33 <Brains>	delay: Switch what? THe battery in your existing laptop? THat's going to depend on exactly which one you have.
Mar 06 22:46:34 <delay>	I don't know if this is due to a crash
Mar 06 22:46:37 <delay>	the battery
Mar 06 22:46:39 <delay>	I have no idea
Mar 06 22:47:10 <delay>	I mean I have an older laptop sometimes just dies
Mar 06 22:47:16 <delay>	it often happens
Mar 06 22:47:17 <Brains>	No, the suddenly-turning-off isn't a CPU problem nor a battery problem, its a heat and/or age problem. 
Mar 06 22:47:20 <delay>	I don't know why
Mar 06 22:47:37 <delay>	age problem
Mar 06 22:47:44 <Brains>	Again, I could tell you exactly why if I knew what machine it was.
Mar 06 22:47:49 <delay>	yes I've observed that mac books were meant to last only 3-4 years
Mar 06 22:47:52 <delay>	then they are dead
Mar 06 22:48:16 <Brains>	Then you're not treating them very nicely, because eight years is how long most MacBooks last.
Mar 06 22:48:18 *	Cpuroast looks at his mid-2012 macbook pro still running strong :)
Mar 06 22:48:21 <delay>	You can tell me exactly?
Mar 06 22:48:42 <delay>	The macbook pro I want to switch the battery from is the one I've given you the specification of above
Mar 06 22:48:45 <Brains>	Every model has quirks that appear over time, and with over thirty years as an Apple tech, I know most of them :)
Mar 06 22:48:54 <delay>	MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)
Mar 06 22:49:12 <jaybe>	mbp last so long
Mar 06 22:49:18 <Brains>	That's better. Specs don't matter as much.
Mar 06 22:49:45 <jaybe>	kept a 2009 mbp for 10 years .sold it for ~600US at the time **right** before m1 breached ;)
Mar 06 22:50:06 <Brains>	And that's nine years old. The battery is bonded to the topcase. There's also an official battery recall program for the 2015 15in.
Mar 06 22:50:22 <jaybe>	easy to read about it and participate adn taek advantage
Mar 06 22:50:29 <delay>	well but this one is from 2017
Mar 06 22:50:31 <delay>	actually
Mar 06 22:50:37 <delay>	I don't know why it says mid 2015
Mar 06 22:50:41 <delay>	it's just the model year
Mar 06 22:50:42 <Brains>	Because that's what it is.
Mar 06 22:50:43 <delay>	I suppose
Mar 06 22:50:52 <delay>	but this was new in 2017
Mar 06 22:50:58 <Brains>	To you, maybe.
Mar 06 22:51:07 <Brains>	THey stopped making them in late 2016.
Mar 06 22:51:22 <jaybe>	i bought a new watering can in 2009 and it was brand new then
Mar 06 22:51:25 <delay>	maybe they stopped making them, but it was new in the box
Mar 06 22:51:31 <Brains>	So its eight, so it is near end of life anyway.
Mar 06 22:51:32 <jaybe>	today is not new because it is not 2009 any longer
Mar 06 22:52:24 <delay>	mine has almost 7 years
Mar 06 22:52:26 <Brains>	delay: See if your machine qualifies. https://support.apple.com/15-inch-macbook-pro-battery-recall
Mar 06 22:52:36 <delay>	and the battery does not last more than 15-30 minutes
Mar 06 22:52:53 <jaybe>	that may indicate a problematic problem
Mar 06 22:53:01 <jaybe>	that is unusual and unexpected behavior
Mar 06 22:53:15 <Brains>	If your machine does not qualify, get rid of it, as it is not worth spending any more money on.
Mar 06 22:53:46 <delay>	ok, thanks I will check that
Mar 06 22:53:51 <delay>	how much do ur batteries last?
Mar 06 22:53:53 <delay>	usually
Mar 06 22:54:03 <delay>	i mean it clearly depends on how you're using ur laptop
Mar 06 22:54:15 <jaybe>	easily couple days
Mar 06 22:54:21 <delay>	wtf
Mar 06 22:54:23 <delay>	really?
Mar 06 22:54:32 <delay>	without having it plugged in?
Mar 06 22:54:41 <Brains>	Joys of Apple silicon.
Mar 06 22:54:53 <jaybe>	man those follow up questions hurt
Mar 06 22:54:54 <delay>	and do u use it everyday?
Mar 06 22:55:06 <jaybe>	they don’t hurt so much as they are cringe
Mar 06 22:55:08 <delay>	well, I've used an m1 too for work and they don't last much, but it wasn't new
Mar 06 22:55:18 <jaybe>	hope your day improves
Mar 06 22:55:23 <Brains>	Getting two or three ten-hour working days off a single charge is not uncommon.
Mar 06 22:55:36 <jaybe>	i pay attention to power usage however so i’m probably 'uncommon
Mar 06 22:56:03 <jaybe>	i.e. display brightness, running applications, connected sockets/services, etc. while mobile… for… battery reasons
Mar 06 22:56:18 <delay>	you're saying that you can work for 3 days, each day for 10 hours, without charging it?
Mar 06 22:56:21 <jaybe>	macos provides for functioning in that performant lane if interested and willing
Mar 06 22:56:41 <Brains>	Most folk, though, will get a whole day off a charge. Unplug from the charger for breakfast, surf-n-work all day & evening, plug in charger before bead, rinse repeat.
Mar 06 22:57:13 <delay>	so what are your recommendations for battery life improvement?
Mar 06 22:57:14 <Brains>	Yes, multiple days per charge with an Apple silicon MacBook is very possible.
Mar 06 22:57:25 <Brains>	Getting rid of Intel, for starters :)
Mar 06 22:57:32 <jaybe>	and if i chose to watch media, use heavy radio bandwidth (wifi), compile giant things all day, etc. then i wouldn’t do that on a battery in the first place, nor expect it out of it
Mar 06 22:57:39 <delay>	well I recently used an m1 for work and it didn't last 1 day
Mar 06 22:57:49 <delay>	but I do some calculations during the day
Mar 06 22:57:54 <delay>	and I have many apps opened, often
Mar 06 22:57:55 <jaybe>	doing 'work' "all day" would use a battery
Mar 06 22:58:01 <jaybe>	common sense
Mar 06 22:58:01 <delay>	so it's not the best for the battery, I suppose
Mar 06 22:58:37 <Brains>	Single biggest power-saving tip with ASi Macs - don't use Chromium-based browsers, don't run Intel-only software that relies on Rosetta2.
Mar 06 22:58:44 <delay>	well, ideally, I'd like to work a entire day without having to recharge
Mar 06 22:58:46 <jaybe>	(and screen brightness)
Mar 06 22:58:58 <jaybe>	then get a wheelbarrow and a car battery
Mar 06 22:59:02 <delay>	so batteries should last at least 18 hours (say 6 for sleeping) without needing to be recharged
Mar 06 22:59:11 <jaybe>	they can
Mar 06 22:59:12 <jaybe>	and do
Mar 06 22:59:26 <Brains>	*nods* Screen is the single-most greediest power consumer on ASi laptops, wifi is second, SoC is third.
Mar 06 22:59:43 <jaybe>	light is bright is lack of night 
Mar 06 22:59:52 <delay>	well I've been using chrome for a long time
Mar 06 22:59:57 <delay>	why do u say that?
Mar 06 22:59:59 <jaybe>	and expensive light when alone at night
Mar 06 23:00:00 <delay>	any evidence?
Mar 06 23:00:03 <Brains>	Because Chrome is shit?
Mar 06 23:00:17 <jaybe>	chrime is ripe for the slaughtering but no one would want to eat any of it
Mar 06 23:00:19 <Brains>	It is horrendously inefficient, code-wise.
Mar 06 23:00:41 <delay>	it's not slow
Mar 06 23:00:45 <jaybe>	hog
Mar 06 23:00:48 <jaybe>	bloated sick hog
Mar 06 23:00:54 <delay>	so what do u use?
Mar 06 23:01:04 <jaybe>	a bloated sick hog that has learned to acquire and huff paint
Mar 06 23:01:16 <delay>	I want to switch to a browser with more privacy and security features

Mar 06 23:01:19 <delay>	tor is too slow
Mar 06 23:01:25 <Brains>	Its a bloaty CPU hog. Its fast the same way a mile-per-gallon drag racer is fast.
Mar 06 23:01:42 <jaybe>	Brains: you’re being too kind :p
Mar 06 23:02:00 <Brains>	:p
Mar 06 23:03:06 <Brains>	Chromium is a CPU-pig no matter what platform it runs on, but its really greedy on macOS (no matter what architecture) because it brings along its own way of doing things that the OS would normally handle.
Mar 06 23:03:33 <jaybe>	and brings its dirty filthy background friend along with it
Mar 06 23:03:41 <jaybe>	s/friends
Mar 06 23:03:47 <Brains>	Fucking Google Keystone. Fucking.
Mar 06 23:04:30 <Brains>	Safari first, Firefox a distant second choice if you require more control over your browsing experience.
Mar 06 23:04:56 <Brains>	I will never, ever, use anything based on Chromium.
Mar 06 23:05:11 *	Brains thinks GoogleTaint™ is nasty
Mar 06 23:05:14 <delay>	I used to use safari back in the day, but I don't know, I got used to this chrome
Mar 06 23:05:24 <delay>	cuz maybe I also used it in the windows back in the day
Mar 06 23:05:28 <delay>	but now I uses edge
Mar 06 23:05:33 <jaybe>	people get used to consumption and misery
Mar 06 23:05:35 <Brains>	Which is Chromium.
Mar 06 23:05:40 <delay>	lol
Mar 06 23:05:41 <jaybe>	best to get used to getting used to something less icky
Mar 06 23:06:00 <delay>	edge is pretty too good i'd say
Mar 06 23:06:15 <delay>	it's fast
Mar 06 23:06:32 <delay>	maybe I'll switch to safari on the mac
Mar 06 23:06:42 <jaybe>	don’t have to 'switch'
Mar 06 23:06:57 <jaybe>	consider using safari on macos next time you use it. browse. be spider like. webby.
Mar 06 23:07:21 <jaybe>	if it works, know it will be most performant with macos and its hardware

Mar 06 23:09:39 <jaybe>	haha
Mar 06 23:11:28 <delay>	so does that mean that you like firefox?
Mar 06 23:11:42 <delay>	I've also tried it in the past, btw
Mar 06 23:12:08 <delay>	but I must tell you, edge has nothing to do with IE
Mar 06 23:12:11 <jaybe>	the fox is also obese and bloated however would be my first choice for a second-opinoin browser
Mar 06 23:12:14 <delay>	only the company
Mar 06 23:12:16 <delay>	that developed it
Mar 06 23:17:55 <Brains>	Edge was initially its own browser & own engine when Microsoft first released it for Windows. Then they decided it was too much effort, swallowed a handful of Fukitol pills and wrapped their own skin around a Chromium engine.
Mar 06 23:18:44 <nebiros>	Brains: I think the only one that doesn't use chromium these days is firefox, :\
Mar 06 23:18:53 <Brains>	I'm quite happy with Firefox, and even happier with its fork Pale Moon.
Mar 06 23:19:24 <Brains>	jaybe: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GH-1s-MbIAAZy0D.jpg
Mar 06 23:20:03 <nebiros>	Brains: works well on macOS?, cause last time I was using firefox it was eating lots of resources, :(
Mar 06 23:20:48 *	jaybe lols - ultimately Brains - yup
Mar 06 23:21:23 <Brains>	nebiros: Its still greedy, but its not a battery glutton like Chrime.
Mar 06 23:22:10 <Brains>	Speed (specifically the lack thereof) doesn't concern me these days. *pats his little Core i5 2c2t MBA web-machine*
Mar 06 23:22:35 <jaybe>	i still sometimes often never email my url
Mar 06 23:22:44 <Brains>	The year is 2026: After losing Jony Ive, Evans Hankey & many other design heavyweights, Apple hired Breville's designer of the toasted sandwich grill to head up their next laptop project. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GH4gUNqXoAADOsk.jpg
Mar 06 23:25:37 <nebiros>	bn_work: looks correct
Mar 06 23:25:41 <nebiros>	erhj
Mar 06 23:29:44 <NDPMacBook>	I believe a sausage dog, or two is in order for dinner tonight.
Mar 06 23:29:55 <delay>	I didn't know edge was built on top of chromium
Mar 06 23:30:05 <delay>	but it actually feels faster than chrome
Mar 06 23:30:26 <delay>	maybe it's because I use chrome on this dying mac
Mar 06 23:30:36 <delay>	while I use edge of my pc, which is newer and more powerful
Mar 06 23:30:47 <delay>	I should try edge on the mac
Mar 06 23:30:50 <delay>	just to check
Mar 06 23:30:54 <delay>	or chrome on the pc
Mar 06 23:40:14 <swift110-mobile>	Hmm

Mar 07 15:11:09 <fris>	thinking about getting the base model of new air
Mar 07 15:11:49 <MacinMan>	fris: the new air looks nice as do the current Pros
Mar 07 15:12:13 <fris>	reallyh only have a max budet of 2000 though
Mar 07 15:12:28 <fris>	and need/want at least 512gb or 1tb ssd
Mar 07 15:12:41 <MacinMan>	I will need a new Mac at some point but I really don't know what choice to make right now.  I prefer desktops but a laptop would be portable
Mar 07 15:13:16 <MacinMan>	Also there is the whole platform concern when it comes to backward compatibility / third party
Mar 07 15:13:32 <MacinMan>	For macOS by itself a new Mac would be fine.
Mar 07 15:13:41 <MacinMan>	And modern software as well
Mar 07 15:14:10 <cirrusbonsai>	i just missed out on an M2 Pro MacMini with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD for $1600 from the refurb page.
Mar 07 15:14:38 <cirrusbonsai>	but scope bloat has started and I'm eyeing a Mac Studio now.
Mar 07 15:15:11 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: the studio looks like a nice mini tower 
Mar 07 15:16:00 <MacinMan>	Larger than a mini but not huge
Mar 07 15:16:28 <cirrusbonsai>	M2 Max for $1869... about the same price as the a new MacMini M2 Pro (same RAM and storage specs).
Mar 07 15:16:56 <MacinMan>	Did they update the mini to M3 yet ?
Mar 07 15:17:18 <cirrusbonsai>	not yet
Mar 07 15:18:09 <MacinMan>	I'm also watching for that larger iMac rumored to come as well
Mar 07 15:18:30 <fris>	MacinMan: i would prob get that
Mar 07 15:18:30 <MacinMan>	I'm just wondering if I should give up on that rumor
Mar 07 15:18:36 <fris>	but 24 inch is way to small currently
Mar 07 15:18:53 <cirrusbonsai>	yeah, the 27" is a nice size
Mar 07 15:19:21 <fris>	need to check owc used stock for some items, they sent me the pdf yesterday
Mar 07 15:19:57 <cirrusbonsai>	yeah, that's my next stop.
Mar 07 15:20:10 <fris>	my friend offered me 1300 for mac mac mini, i bought it for 700 in nov
Mar 07 15:21:13 <fris>	seems they only have m1 series owc used
Mar 07 15:21:18 <fris>	at least here in canada
Mar 07 15:21:22 <MacinMan>	fris: I'm actually fine with my current hardware it's more software I'm concerned about. Open core isn't going to be an option for me as too many things I would want to just work, don't and while Monterey is fine I'm just trying to consider security after it's out of support. Personally I'm not really concerned all that much right now because. I only go to trusted sites, and Chrome and Firefox will continue to receive updates for a while
Mar 07 15:21:22 <MacinMan>	 and beyond that I just do local stuff. So based on that I don't think I'd have a high security risk sticking with an older os
Mar 07 15:21:51 <fris>	2013 12 core, 64gb 2tb ssd mac po for 400$ :p
Mar 07 15:22:17 <fris>	cirrusbonsai: think owc usa has mac studios 
Mar 07 15:22:44 <utterer>	i have like 5 2013 mac pros collecting dust at the office. failover machines for when the failovers fail lol
Mar 07 15:23:08 <fris>	decnet machine to pickup if someone just wants to try mac for first time and on budget
Mar 07 15:23:29 <utterer>	and like 12 mac pro 2. and 3. 1’s that I can’t even give away 
Mar 07 15:23:31 <MacinMan>	utterer: I've heard the trash can pros had quite a few issues
Mar 07 15:23:57 <utterer>	i had a few that were under the apple extended warranty for gpu failure
Mar 07 15:24:33 <MacinMan>	I think Apple did an M series pro didn't they?
Mar 07 15:24:43 <fris>	Apple M2 chip with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine 24GB memory 2.0TB Solid-State Drive 1749
Mar 07 15:24:48 <MacinMan>	Is that machine actually pro like the old chase greater ?
Mar 07 15:24:54 <MacinMan>	Grater 
Mar 07 15:24:55 <fris>	(air)
Mar 07 15:25:01 <utterer>	yes it uses the same
Mar 07 15:25:05 <fris>	MacinMan: no thats the garbage can
Mar 07 15:25:08 <utterer>	chassis
Mar 07 15:25:35 <utterer>	the m series pro uses the same chassis and is basically a studio mounted inside it 
Mar 07 15:25:46 <MacinMan>	oh
Mar 07 15:26:13 <fris>	owc has a m3 macbook pro with 8gb/512 for 1749, wish it had 16 or 24gb :/

Mar 07 15:27:47 <utterer>	i was thinking of using one of the 2013 pros at home to replace my Mac Mini intel that serves as my Homebridge and Zomboid server but it may be overkill 
Mar 07 15:28:09 <fris>	my 2018 mini is my current desktop
Mar 07 15:28:29 <utterer>	yeah the 2018 is my desktop and I have a 2014 is the one above
Mar 07 15:28:44 <fris>	what specs you got on your 2018
Mar 07 15:29:12 <fris>	mines the i7 6 core, 64gb, 2tb, 10gbether maxed out version got for 700 in november
Mar 07 15:29:31 <utterer>	the i5 3ghz, 16GB, 512
Mar 07 15:30:06 <fris>	no real speeed issues, onlything is if im running vmware fusion and running my windows vm and doing windows updates, u can hear the fans going super loud, but i assume that will happen even with silicon
Mar 07 15:30:31 <utterer>	I have yet to hear them on my
Mar 07 15:30:33 <utterer>	MBP
Mar 07 15:31:17 <MacinMan>	fris: I seem to only get fans on this late 2015 iMac when watching 4K content on Youtube. Other than that, it's pretty quiet
Mar 07 15:31:39 <fris>	or when chrome goes nuts i hear fans :p
Mar 07 15:32:22 <utterer>	I keep my mini vertical and I think that caused the ethernet on it to fail. Had to do an AppleCare replacement
Mar 07 15:32:39 <kferris>	ports down?
Mar 07 15:33:01 <utterer>	disappeared altogether as if it didn’t exist
Mar 07 15:33:02 <fris>	have 10gb ethernet, but i dont have a direct ethernet connection :p
Mar 07 15:33:03 <MacinMan>	fris: Sonoma runs decently in a Fusion VM on this iMac so I might do that for a while. Keep Monterey as the stable host and then just use a vm for stuff that needs a newer version as most of the stuff isn't really intense so works fine in a vm
Mar 07 15:33:25 <fris>	im on monterey
Mar 07 15:33:33 <fris>	i can upgrade to sonoma
Mar 07 15:33:54 <utterer>	the new nas I got has 2.5gb ports. what a weird standard
Mar 07 15:34:10 <utterer>	quasi-standard
Mar 07 15:35:35 <MacinMan>	fris: I tried Sonoma with open core legacy patcher and for the most was stable with the exception of certain graphics  related stuff. And honestly I like Monterey better and not a fan of all the changes apple is making to the OS.
Mar 07 15:35:41 <fris>	well i like total finder and it doesnt work with sonoma (works with ventura) so i could upgrade i guess to that
Mar 07 15:37:04 <MacinMan>	fris: if I use Ventura, or Sonoma on this iMac by Open Core I would lose 3D acceleration in VMs and a few other quirks and while it wouldn't be a daily need I prefer things to just work when I need / want them
Mar 07 15:37:38 <fris>	well total finder kinda works but you have to right click finder icon each time, instead of just cliking on finder icon for new window'
Mar 07 15:40:22 <MacinMan>	fris: I was curious about something, maybe you can answer this. No one on the forum bothered to try:  what does Ventura / Sonoma base the find my Mac setting on?  What I mean is when I had Sonoma on the iMac it always said it was off in the device info under iCloud while the MBP on Sonoma / Ventura said on. The only difference between the two was the default network connection. The iMac is ethernet and the MBP is WiFi but the iMac has
Mar 07 15:40:22 <MacinMan>	 Wifi on as the secondary connection but not connected just so location works.
Mar 07 15:42:33 <MacinMan>	I know it's also functioning on the iMac as well, because it shows up in Find My
Mar 07 16:02:11 <MacinMan>	Also the side channel mitigation setting in VMware what exactly is this for when it comes to a virtual machine ?
Mar 07 16:02:33 <MacinMan>	I usually disable it because it tends to slow down the VM
Mar 07 16:13:00 <MacinMan>	I'm also considering creating a Mojave install iso as to not take up a USB drive.  Hopefully the Mac can boot from a DVD
Mar 07 16:14:55 <MacinMan>	I think since Mojave was smaller it should fit on a dual layer disc
Mar 07 16:20:03 <MacinMan>	I've asked this before, but there isn't any reason to go older Thant Mojave for legacy support correct?
Mar 07 16:20:55 <cirrusbonsai>	Legacy support of what?
Mar 07 16:21:15 <MacinMan>	32 bit apps / games that won't run on a 64 bit only os
Mar 07 16:22:44 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: this iMac can go all the way back to El Capitan, but I don't think I need to go back that far for an install of a legacy OS to use when Needed so that's why I'm picking Mojave 
Mar 07 16:22:45 <cirrusbonsai>	ah.  I try not to hang on to old apps.  you would know more than me.
Mar 07 16:24:10 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: well some of the launchers on GOG were never updated for modern macOS so if I want to play them I either need a windows VM or a 32 bit capable macOS. So I'm thinking 32 - bit macOS to not have the VM overhead
Mar 07 16:29:17 <MacinMan>	The DVD idea is out though, I didn't think Mojave would be be bigger than 8.5 GB
Mar 07 17:11:01 <swift110-mobile>	Oh
Mar 07 17:12:20 <swift110-mobile>	utterer: you in the us?
Mar 07 17:12:41 <swift110-mobile>	I wouldn’t mind one of those Mac pros
Mar 07 17:12:55 <conr>	what is the quickest way to reply to a messages app thread with only a keyboard?
Mar 07 17:13:45 <conr>	i've tried `cmd + n` or the `cmd + f` options but they are janky when searching for contacts.
Mar 07 17:23:58 <pocketprotector>	you know when you add an account through mail and it sends you off to your provides login page.. in my case its chrome... is there a special name for the window that gets created? im trying to figure out how to enable my extensions on that chrome window to autofill passwords.
Mar 07 17:24:12 <pocketprotector>	providers
Mar 07 17:24:34 <pocketprotector>	some how its sending me to a chrome window without any features.

Mar 07 17:40:24 <conr>	How you toggle your search results (cmd + f) on macos messages.app with a keyboard? up and down arrow keys don't work.
Mar 07 17:41:36 <jaybe>	"Show More"
Mar 07 17:41:53 <jaybe>	unfortunately, requires an action

Mar 07 17:48:31 <conr>	smh
Mar 07 17:48:44 <jaybe>	nah- at least you figured it out and can do it! :)

Mar 07 19:53:19 <MacinMan>	Well, just did the rest of my updates today. 
Mar 07 19:53:24 <MacinMan>	Just got done with the mac
Mar 07 20:08:22 <MacinMan>	Updating to 14.4 in a VM to see what it adds.  I got a Sonoma VM set up today and it's actually working quite well or looking at apps that require a newer macOS version.  I just didn't install the pro apps because those don't support running in a virtual machine but everything else I wanted to look at seems to work.

Mar 07 20:12:02 <MacinMan>	Anyone happen to know what AEServer is?  It doesn't show up in accessibility on a new install but after I've installed stuff and have used it for a while it shows up in the accessibility section in privacy settings
Mar 07 20:12:23 <MacinMan>	I want to say Apple Event but not sure what's causing it to be put there
Mar 07 20:13:01 <MacinMan>	For example I don't think it showed up until after the Monterey update today. 
Mar 07 20:13:52 <MacinMan>	I've also been keeping an eye on my iMac's EFI firmware in SilentKnight and that wasn't updated either.
Mar 07 20:44:04 <cirrusbonsai>	MacinMan google it.  AEServer is fine.
Mar 07 20:45:21 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: I wasn't worried about it. was just curious if anyone knew off the top of their heads
Mar 07 20:45:32 <MacinMan>	I'll look it up at some point
Mar 07 20:52:51 <MacinMan>	cirrusbonsai: ok so it's for remote apple events just looked it up. Meaning it probably gets activated when I use screen sharing

Mar 09 14:55:15 <MacinMan>	Strange, somehow the VM went to sleep but the window never went back 
Mar 09 14:55:21 <MacinMan>	"Black"
Mar 09 21:36:48 <Brains>	G'day.
Mar 09 22:05:58 <Buzzlewoo>	yo
Mar 09 22:18:49 <MacinMan>	Hey utterer is Curve (formally vectermator ) worth paying for the pro subscription?  I bought the affinity suite up front so just wondered if curve would offer me anything that doesn't do.
Mar 09 22:21:17 <MacinMan>	I remember you deleted it when you saw it went to subscription. Just wondered if you ever went back to it after seeing if they offered anything useful
Mar 09 22:25:11 <Buzzlewoo>	I deleted vectornator for the same reason. went affinity years ago. solid kit.
Mar 09 22:26:36 <MacinMan>	Buzzlewoo: when Affinity released version 2 in 2022, I think it was, I purchased the whole suite for a one time payment of $99. Prior to that I only had affinity photo in the version 1x series
Mar 09 22:27:54 <MacinMan>	When I took graphics / broadcast the adobe creative suite was used plus the old version of Final Cut Studio. Now things have changed so much I am not sure what's the standard today
Mar 09 22:41:00 <Buzzlewoo>	Adobe is still the standard but the other apps aren't crap. in fact in many ways, affinity has leapfrogged adobe
Mar 09 22:41:43 <MacinMan>	Well, I know some loyal adobe users quit when they went subscription only as well
Mar 09 22:41:58 <Buzzlewoo>	factprs to consider: what do your employers / clients / colleagues use, MUST you use the same apps, exactly and when, exactly, wll AI evaporate "employment" as we know it?
Mar 09 22:42:54 <MacinMan>	Buzzlewoo: in my case and right now, I would be looking at this situation as an independent creator but also seeking compatibility  with the general public too
Mar 09 22:43:54 <Buzzlewoo>	in that case, you need only concern yourself with producing the deliverables you owe your clients
Mar 09 22:44:25 <Buzzlewoo>	I've been using adobe since illustrator came on a single floppy disk. I'd happily go into battle with Affinitiy.
Mar 09 22:46:05 <Buzzlewoo>	affinity can read and write adobe files; the exceptino is InDesign to Publisher..you can go one way, not the other
Mar 09 22:46:37 <Buzzlewoo>	adobe is investing in AI; affinity has not yet made such a move.
Mar 09 22:46:59 <Brains>	... thank the gods.
Mar 09 22:47:12 <Brains>	AI art is an oxymoron.
Mar 09 22:47:29 <MacinMan>	Buzzlewoo: for photos I have Pixelmator pro, affinity photo and Gimp for the three tool selection
Mar 09 22:48:07 <MacinMan>	I also have Inkscape as an illustrator alternative as well as the affinity variant as well
Mar 09 22:50:32 <Buzzlewoo>	true enough, Brains  but for many, "good enough" wins the race
Mar 09 22:50:56 <Buzzlewoo>	inkscape is most worthy, as are gimp and scribus. and don't forget blender, y'all
Mar 09 22:51:08 <Buzzlewoo>	I've done pro level work with all 3
Mar 09 22:51:43 <MacinMan>	Thank you I forgot about Blender,  I have that as well
Mar 09 22:52:18 <circuitbone>	It the datasets are vetted, it's a fine tool.
Mar 09 22:53:07 <circuitbone>	The problem arises when commercial data / information is used without permission to compete against your own commercialisation.
Mar 09 22:53:25 <Buzzlewoo>	circuitbone  huh?
Mar 09 22:56:41 <Brains>	Today's "AI" was meant to do the tedious stuff for creative people, not doing the creative stuff for tedious people :)
Mar 09 22:57:28 <circuitbone>	The current tools out there under the umbrella for generative ai using gans are trained on scraped data ( illegal procurement )
Mar 09 22:57:49 <circuitbone>	Some companies have vetted datasets ( Adobe ) for one.
Mar 09 23:00:11 <Buzzlewoo>	oh got it. yeah but that doesn't seem to matter to the AI set. all's fair in love, war, and eliminating overhead and people
Mar 09 23:00:17 <Buzzlewoo>	swipery is ever on the table
Mar 09 23:00:30 <circuitbone>	Anything that uses a dataset like this will be under scrutiny later for legal ramifications. https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/
Mar 09 23:02:24 <circuitbone>	Everywhere I have worked in developing games, the lawyers have to vett the work we produce to make sure it's commercially viable to distribute. This component is usually skipped over with get rich with ai videos. They only care about the views, scams happen.
Mar 09 23:02:41 <circuitbone>	Same for all other commercial mediums.
Mar 09 23:02:54 <circuitbone>	At some stage we will have C2PA for all media.
Mar 09 23:04:07 <circuitbone>	If you are dumb enough to buy prompts and generate works for the intent to go commercial, you might have some sad face days on your horizon. https://promptbase.com/
Mar 09 23:04:39 <Buzzlewoo>	who will pick up the righteous legal banner?
Mar 09 23:04:56 <circuitbone>	At the moment there are two large cases awaiting evaluation.
Mar 09 23:05:05 <Buzzlewoo>	really? I did not know that.
Mar 09 23:05:21 <circuitbone>	stay in your lane
Mar 09 23:05:38 <Buzzlewoo>	if your pockets are deep enough, any crime you commit becomes law
Mar 09 23:05:55 <circuitbone>	https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23587393/ai-art-copyright-lawsuit-getty-images-stable-diffusion
Mar 09 23:06:38 <circuitbone>	Many other large corporations are awaiting verdicts. The font masters of the world will peck at the corpse next.
Mar 09 23:11:24 <circuitbone>	It's a little difficult to plead innocence or denial when the hallucinations statistical data produces near perfect watermarks. https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/uowomvMZ/media_FUvJfuDXsAEnpR5.png
Mar 09 23:12:49 <circuitbone>	If you want to use a tool like that commercially, Adobe firefly is currently using vetted datasets.

Mar 10 17:43:40 <NDPMacBook>	I've received reports from my stomach that Dunkin Donuts is brazenly holding Sausage and Egg sandwiches on Croissants, with Hasbrowns and Gatorades along with sugary glazed donuts. I'm going to have to check out this transgression.
Mar 10 18:11:09 <conr>	does anybody have a NFS share they mount with their macOS device? i'm able to do it, but its only in read-only mode. Can't r/w.

Mar 10 19:36:12 <swift110-mobile>	hey Buzzlewoo 
Mar 10 19:51:05 <jaybe>	'day all
Mar 10 20:16:44 <puff>	Afternoon.  I'm looking for suggestions for programming editors available on MacOSX, that won't be too complicated for a beginner programmer (my friend, mac user, artist) and won't be too annoying for me (mostly Linux guy, experienced programmer, lifelong emacs fan).
Mar 10 20:17:34 <puff>	I've been teaching my friend to program.  So far we've been working on javascript in a proprietary app called max/msp (my friend is an artist who does a lot of stuff with max/msp).  The max/msp default editor for javascript files is very limited.  Tried to use some other Mac editor the other day, but it kept trying to capitalize words for us, etc, ended up being more trouble than it was worth.
Mar 10 20:20:46 <NDPMacBook>	Hope this helps puff https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/javascript-editors-mac/
Mar 10 20:21:00 <jaybe>	Sublime Text
Mar 10 20:21:04 <puff>	NDPMacBook: Thanks.
Mar 10 20:21:09 <puff>	jaybe: Thanks.

Mar 10 20:40:39 <setnan>	puff: (MacOSX is the old name, 2016 ;) ) for js on macOS most of my contacts primarily use VSCode, personally i use VSCodium (same concept as Chrome vs Chromium), mainly because its popularity, advanced autocompletion and a lot of extensions (for web dev) that make life easier, but maybe not the first choice for a total beginner. Sublime Text is cool and probably the easiest
Mar 10 20:42:19 <setnan>	(i use BBEdit free version too for quick and fast edit + sftp)
Mar 10 21:29:19 <Buzzlewoo>	yo
