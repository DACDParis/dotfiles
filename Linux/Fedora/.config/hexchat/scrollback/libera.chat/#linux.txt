T 1710209080 18<27preach18>	and the hex numbers are just the opcodes that the assembly uses underneath i.e. the actual bytes in the binary at those offsets
T 1710209114 18<27preach18>	maybe you meant to "break main" instead ?
T 1710209181 18<29monkeyPlus18>	so every file, has similiar offsets...but a file on filesystem, is different

T 1710209313 18<29monkeyPlus18>	ah ok, so elf files are different between source and binary?

T 1710209622 18<22espresso18>	monkeyPlus: well the source would be .c, .cpp, .h, .py, whatever like on github, right? gdb works only on compiled binaries, showing virtual offsets (starting at 0) since that's more useful than starting at 0xBAADF00D. binary will be the same in RAM as on FS

T 1710236207 18<25Guest652818>	With a point release I have a guaranteed stability, since I know for certain that the system's ABI is not going to change until the next release, that is every 2 years circa for Debian. That's by the very definition a stable system, since nothing changes other than security updates. That's the model that I prefer.
T 1710236235 18<20Gamah18>	as far as an 'os' or 'flavor' of linux idk... but if you're someone who cares about having bleeding edge patches you should consider an OS with a reasonable packagae manager that lets you select those channels with minimal effort... and gives you an option to rollback

T 1710248589 18<22peetaur18>	ok...so with a container I think this is not "pci/usb passthrough" as in VMs, so forget about what I said about not having the driver bound in the host too or what kind of controller it is (SAS HBA or SATA). (which I think is abusing this passthrough term... if the host takes a file open io and has to use its own zfs driver, etc. that is not pass through... pass through means it goes to the hardware or whatever it points to without translating anything)

T 1710484931 18<22espresso18>	I just switched to Konversation and find it's much like HexChat

T 1710485241 18<25mdogg18>	espresso: Does it store user data to ~/.config/Konversation ?   Some programs store data all over the place which I find annoying, so I'm just curious.
T 1710485355 18<22espresso18>	mdogg: seems rather configurable and can do a minimal UI, and uses ~/.config/konversationrc (and a dir in ~/.local/share/konversation)
T 1710485604 18<25mdogg18>	If I'm honest, a different IRC client would need to have at least one fairly remarkable feature or perk before I would consider switching from HexChat.  I feel the same way about Konsole for a terminal and KeePassXC for a password manager.
T 1710485624 18<25mdogg18>	I'm sure you know how ti is - you use something for so long it just becomes a part of you somehow.
T 1710485671 18*	24ski finds it annoying when programs store data in `~/.config',`~/.local',`~/.cache'
T 1710485725 18<25mdogg18>	Actually, I have only been using KeePassXC for a few years.  Someone in #Libera recommended that I try that.  Prior to KeePassXC, I had been saving my usernames/passwords in an encrypted .odf sheet.
T 1710485770 18<22espresso18>	I do *really* like Konsole. and I also like HexChat but it was getting killed in Xwayland by some things like closing Firefox, so I thought I'd look.
T 1710485782 18<25mdogg18>	Several people in Libera mentioned it, actually.  They said it would change my life, and they were right.
T 1710485957 18<25mdogg18>	I couple of hours ago, I logged into Wayland for the first time in 9 months.  I updated my distro and the new Plasma was included so I decided to give Wayland another shot.  I had some really weird issues in the past, too.  So far things seem to be running well, but it is nice to know I still have x11 as a backup just in case.
T 1710486024 18<26KindOne18>	I use keepassxc + veracrypt, the keypassxc file is inside a veracrypt volume that is synced between all my laptops/desktops
T 1710486101 18<22espresso18>	(and Konversation's SysTray/notification functionality is a lot like HexChat) yeah, we still have X if needed. I'm still 7z-ing my non-browser passwords (heh) but will check out the tip on keepass
T 1710486114 18<25mdogg18>	One problem I had in HexChat (which is now corrected) was that when I hit the top-right 'x' to close the app, I have it set to minimize to the systray.  9 months ago when I clicked on the HexChat icon in the systray to bring it back up, it didn't do anything.  I would have to click around underneath different icons in order to bring it back up - sometimes between the battery and the clock would do it and other times under the volume would do it.
T 1710486114 18<25mdogg18>	Weird things like that.
T 1710486197 18<25mdogg18>	KindOne: Out of curiousity, how do you access it from your phone when you're out of town?
T 1710486278 18<26KindOne18>	I have a laptop.
T 1710486294 18<25mdogg18>	Ah cool.
T 1710486382 18<25mdogg18>	Oh, lemme see if UT still plays.  Just a sec.
T 1710486627 18<25mdogg18>	Runs just fine.  It does output "WARNING: Running setxkbmap against an Xwayland server" when I exit though, but whatever.
T 1710487045 18<20cappy18>	ski: It's easy enough to symlink ~/.config/hexchat to a place more convenient. I've done this to have HexChat hold all the logs on a separate mounted volume, more easily backed up.
T 1710487290 18<29noobaroo18>	Is there an equivalent to symlinks in exfat?
T 1710487333 18<24ski18>	i'd rather make `~/.config' an empty file
T 1710487401 18<20cappy18>	noobaroo: ExFAT does not support symlinks.
T 1710487415 18<22espresso18>	noobaroo: no. but you may be able to make a bind mount, which is even more like a real directory than symlink

T 1710487759 18<22espresso18>	it's like a mount or symlink that transparently maps access to <source> to <destination>. I use it to 'move' the storage of some directories to more appropriate storage, to save nvme space/wear

T 1710488071 18<24ski18>	(having image preview encourages (some) users to send useless images. and it makes the context span worse)
T 1710488264 18<25mdogg18>	lockywolf: Your "sorting" comment reminded me-  I'd like to be able to right-click a username and have a 'notes" option, which would just be plain-text but attached to the user.

It is not meant for daily use, as their site itself says and using another DE on it defeats the whole point of it; getting latest updates to KDE first and foremost
