T 1709389573 18<25peac18>	if your terminal stores history in a file you could tail it

T 1709389595 18<25peac18>	otherwise i think gnu screen would be the way to go. used to have it in bashrc to always be in a screen session
T 1709389607 18<22pell_18>	no_gravity: you can redirect output to a file or to another command

T 1709389654 18<20no_gravity18>	pell_: Sure, but I often decide *after* I executed the command that I would like to have the output in a file.
T 1709389682 18<20no_gravity18>	The last lines are obviously stored somewhere. Since I can scroll up and down.
T 1709389696 18<22pell_18>	no_gravity: redirect it with the command... rm -v file > rm_output.txt
T 1709389702 18<20no_gravity18>	pell_: Sure, but I often decide *after* I executed the command that I would like to have the output in a file.

T 1709389732 18<20no_gravity18>	ayecee: Sure. But if the terminal program had a way to tell it "Give me your buffer", that would be awesome.
T 1709389739 18<29ayecee18>	maybe there's a way to get terminal buffer contents through some escape sequence, but i don't know one offhand.
T 1709389750 18<25peac18>	no_gravity: could be stored in ram

T 1709389774 18<22pell_18>	maybe readline keeps a cache? that may be worth looking into. or maybe your terminal emulator does
T 1709389775 18<25peac18>	or floppy
T 1709389785 18<29ayecee18>	or maybe it's stored on post-it notes furiously scribbled by a gerbil.
T 1709389800 18<29ayecee18>	no, readline wouldn't cache that.
T 1709389813 18<25peac18>	are you on spice or something ?
T 1709389820 18<22pell_18>	I know there's a cache somewhere because you can scroll back
T 1709389828 18<29ayecee18>	yeah. it's in the terminal program.
T 1709389931 18<20no_gravity18>	One nice way to make output more user friendly would then be to indent blocks of content. Then the user can close all folds in vim and have a nice overview.
T 1709389937 18<22pell_18>	you could always alias or symlink commands to automatically output to an output file when you use them
T 1709389947 18<19wantyapps18>	ayecee: not sure. It works in the tty too..
T 1709389970 18<29ayecee18>	in the console? yeah. the console is the terminal in that case.
T 1709389996 18<22pell_18>	terminal emulators use readline for textual stuff
T 1709390007 18<22pell_18>	that's why I suspect readline keeps that cache
T 1709390008 18<29ayecee18>	no, shells do.

T 1709390140 18<27JanC18>	I mean, maybe that confuses people re: shell vs. terminal
T 1709390146 18<29ayecee18>	for sure
T 1709390189 18<29ayecee18>	no_gravity: if there's a way to get the terminal buffer programmatically, i think it would be specific to the terminal you're using.

T 1709390304 18<29ayecee18>	no_gravity: i thought termcap might have something for that, but while it can move the cursor around the screen, i don't think it can read what's at that point.
T 1709390325 18<22pell_18>	I do know the difference. I've compiled shells before, or I'd have no awareness of readline
T 1709390346 18<20no_gravity18>	ayecee: It would also have to read what is currently not on screen.
T 1709390388 18<29ayecee18>	reckon the buffer is kind of a virtual screen, and what you see is like a viewport onto the bottom of it.
T 1709390406 18<20no_gravity18>	Ha, I found a semi-manual way. Konsole has a "select all" menu entry. It lets you copy everything in the buffer, even the invisible parts. So I am able to paste that into vim afterwards.
T 1709390417 18<29ayecee18>	slick
T 1709390476 18<22pell_18>	no_gravity: if that works for you, why not just scroll back and manually select and copy the line you want
T 1709390501 18<29ayecee18>	because this is faster
T 1709390504 18<27JanC18>	https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECRQCRA.html can read from the screen (but it's not implemented in all terminals)
T 1709390509 18<29ayecee18>	less schlepping around on the scroll bar
T 1709390536 18<27JanC18>	maybe there are other optional or terminal-specific ways
T 1709390536 18<29ayecee18>	JanC: seems to be a checksum
T 1709390539 18<20no_gravity18>	pell_: True, that also works.
T 1709390551 18<29ayecee18>	pretty neat though.
T 1709390559 18<22pell_18>	no_gravity: I thought you wanted something you could run from a script
T 1709390567 18<27JanC18>	ayecee: you can do a 1√ó1 "checksum"
T 1709390568 18<20no_gravity18>	pell_: That would be best.
T 1709390583 18<20no_gravity18>	I guess I could the "select all" and "copy" commands to the konsole terminal via a script.
T 1709390587 18<29ayecee18>	pell_: did you? why'd you ask about scrolling back?
T 1709390591 18<20no_gravity18>	I guess I could send the "select all" and "copy" commands to the konsole terminal via a script.
T 1709390591 18<27JanC18>	let's say it can be abused to get characters
T 1709390616 18<27JanC18>	it's intended for running test suites
T 1709390627 18<22pell_18>	ayecee: because in order to scroll back, the information has to be stored in a cache somewhere, or in memory
T 1709390630 18<29ayecee18>	JanC: that's pretty cool
T 1709390645 18<29ayecee18>	pell_: i think you've misunderstood my question.
T 1709390664 18<29ayecee18>	it's okay. it was rhetorical.
T 1709390696 18<27JanC18>	I'm sure screen, tmux, kitty & some other terminals have terminal-specific ways to get content...
T 1709390698 18<22pell_18>	if it's stored somewhere, there ought to be a way to access it from a script was my point
T 1709390752 18<20no_gravity18>	pell_: And it is. I would expect you can send the "select all" and "copy" commands to the window from a script and then access the clipboard.
T 1709390767 18<29ayecee18>	my point was that scrolling back and selecting wouldn't be accessing it from a script.
T 1709390883 18<27JanC18>	you could use accessibility APIs to access it in many GUI terminals probably
T 1709390913 18<27JanC18>	but that would be rather convoluted & error-prone
T 1709390945 18<22pell_18>	ayecee: and my point is that if you're going to take your hand off the keyboard to use your mouse to access a menu item to put it into a file, you could just as easily scroll back and get the exact thing you want

T 1709475808 18<26frib18>	BIOS was forcing me to manually select my boot drive every time because "GPT header was corrupt". It recommended using BIOS auto recovery of the header, so I did. I no longer have to manually select the boot disk but now my RAID 5 array will not mount because it "can't read superblock on /dev/md2"

T 1709475926 18<22gog18>	but maybe that's what corrupted your GPT header
T 1709475949 18<26frib18>	If I knew one disk was a problem I could rebuild from parity but I really don't even know what happened
T 1709475955 18<25peac18>	the data will stay where it is, so as long as you can rebuild your metadata correctly it should work
T 1709475983 18<26frib18>	peac, it can't hurt to try to rebuild the metadata at this point right? assuming it won't change the data anyway?

T 1709534952 18<27virginiasplane18>	Got curious so I'm asking: How many people here are adjusting their swappiness? The default on a Debian system is 60. You can adjust it in /etc/sysctl.conf. The line looks like this: vm.swappiness=40...
T 1709535015 18<27virginiasplane18>	I think if you don't adjust it, at least on Ubuntu, it's not even there. You have to add it ... But anyway, I changed mine from 60 to 40 and if I have to guess, people don't mess with it... you can render your system unstable if the swappiness doesn't meet the demands of something like i/o wait, memory preassure etc.

T 1709535196 18<27virginiasplane18>	You shouldn't have to create swap files. I only have them because if I didn't, my VMs wouldn't run and the system would either freeze all the time or just wouldn't open any number of apps. I'm not much for Windows obviously ... but on something like Windows, you don't really have a choice. If the memory isn't there, it just won't work... You can adjust paging on Windows but I don't think it's as flexible as swap on Linux

T 1709535660 18<27Affliction18>	It'll start writing "inactive" pages to swap even before it starts evicting them, iirc. No perf hit there, then when you really hit memory pressure, the pages already written can be evicted immediately.
T 1709535839 18<27Affliction18>	I used to tune it down on servers; the idea being they should have enough real RAM for their workload, and swap is more "emergency overflow", but today, meh.

T 1709576994 18<29monr0e18>	MacGyver: In this instance, it is because no pulseaudio candidate is a suitable replacement for the version of pipewire that I have installed, despite there being a version in the repo - thus it thinks something is borken
T 1709577028 18<29ayecee18>	well no, it means that this package depends on a package named pulseaudio, which is not installed
T 1709577045 18<29monr0e18>	usually apt would seek to install a dependency, no?

T 1709635146 18<26stwange18>	livingbeef do i=`echo $i | perl -pe 's/\s//g'`; echo "${i}-Tuesday"; done removes the problem in an ugly way, so it must be some control character

T 1709656249 18<25mdogg18>	If you install an application from source, there will be a file that lists the required dependencies as well but it's a bit more tricky.
T 1709656359 18<25mdogg18>	It's generally better to let your package manager handle the programs you want to install/uninstall because that way it also takes care of any updates and patches that need to take as well.  If you install a program from source then you are responsible for applying any new versions or patches yourself.
T 1709656739 18<25mdogg18>	Oh, one other benefit to using your distro's package manager:  If you try uninstalling something (like 'liblua5_1-5' for example) it will warn you that doing so will impact several other applications, such as mpv and several others.  That way you know which applications will be impacted if you continue.

T 1709687417 18<27bcn_18>	I used iptables rules to allow speficic EXPECTED outbound traffic, then log all, then allow all, so that I create log entries for unexpected outbound.  I recently converted to nftables https://pastebin.com/Tery1ARc and I think maybe its not optimal?  also I'm noticing that SyncThing is making lots of hard to predict port number udp streams that flood the logs, so could I perhaps allow syncthing by process name somehow?
T 1709687481 18<25yziquel18>	rbox and I'm confused. I need to sort all that out. Because standard linux kernels seem to give me page faults and general protection faults when trying to run some virtualisation.

T 1709687863 18<25yziquel18>	katia many general protection faults. And it seems to depend on kernel. For now, I get my kernels from my distros. But it seems sensitive. Occurs with qemu based virtualisation mostly.
T 1709687890 18<25yziquel18>	katia got a frozen VM now. And it seems that if I change the kernel, it's not frozen anymore.

T 1709687920 18<25yziquel18>	katia so I'm double checking all that, and now wondering about that kernel I've got delivered in /boot/HP.

T 1709687961 18<19katia18>	anyway could be anything, could be that you are encountering a bug that is introduced in a modern kernel for example. or some misconfiguration.
T 1709687994 18<25yziquel18>	katia yeah. I'm trying to dive into that. which is why I'm looking at that /boot/HP kernel and wondering...

T 1709688132 18<25yziquel18>	katia i'm really conservative. I back up. then I run file.
T 1709688521 18<19ZLima1218>	yziquel: I don't think file can modify files

T 1709691423 18<19Artfaith18>	It depends on the hardware. Traditionally, you, depending on the hardware, either send a request to get sensors state, or connect to device listening to events, and then, based on known protocol, decodes the received data.

If it's all closed source, I would listen to the events it sends on Kernel (e.g. straced at low levels), and would try implementing based on the data obtained, and hopefully it's well organized and not encrypted/compressed to be distinguishable.

T 1709725683 18<22phogg18>	in fact this much: lsmod | awk '{ print $1 }' | xargs modinfo

T 1709725728 18<22phogg18>	kernels ship with modules, you don't need to work backward from a module to find a kernel version

T 1709725768 18<22phogg18>	how do you know which versions are non-buggy?
T 1709725835 18<25yziquel18>	phogg I require zfs >= 2.2 because zfs < 2.1.x hits a Sapphire Rapids specific bug on avx512f+vmexit page fault, which hits people having Sapphire Rapids + virtualisation + zfs < 2.2.

T 1709725889 18<22phogg18>	sounds like what you need is to look at zfs release documentation for kernels which zfs 2.2 can be applied to, then find the highest such kernel available from your package repo
T 1709725918 18<22phogg18>	this is not something modinfo is going to tell you
T 1709725944 18<25yziquel18>	phogg this is indeed something a TUI tool like aptitude should give me.

T 1709726040 18<22phogg18>	but even then it would not constrain your kernel version
T 1709726084 18<22phogg18>	there's just no way to know which kernel version range is compatible with a module *just* by looking at the module. You have to be a developer of that module, or read enough of it and the kernel source to understand when compatibility breaks
T 1709726129 18<22phogg18>	given that most modules are in-kernel and the compatible version is "the current one only", there's not much call for attempting to sort this out generically
T 1709726136 18<22phogg18>	so, again, check zfs docs
T 1709726141 18<28livingbeef18>	The module should complain during compilation if the version isn't compatible
