T 1710013163 18<20Dus1018>	hello, I am using jq to filter the output of JSON that is output from the `gh` client into another format.  I have the resulting JSON just as I would want it, but I need to have it usable on the shell, which would include escaping characters and getting rid of the line breaks.  jq has a filter called @sh for this very purpose, but I keep getting an error: jq: error (at <stdin>:0): object ({"include":...) can not be escaped for shell
T 1710013223 18<22Anjor18>	Could you use a combination of jq filters to extract the necessary data and then manually escape characters and remove line breaks?

T 1710013359 18<22CrtxReavr18>	Dus10, are you using the -r switch with jq?
T 1710013409 18<22CrtxReavr18>	Dus10, pastebin us a json sample and what you want from it.

T 1710013617 18<20Dus1018>	I need to be able to assign it to an environment variable and then use it again on the shell later
T 1710013637 18<20Dus1018>	so, what it should do is get rid of the new lines and escape the double quotes
T 1710013711 18<22rbox18>	so assign it to an environment varialbe
T 1710013727 18<20Dus1018>	well, that wasn't helpful
T 1710013756 18<20Dus1018>	assigning it to an environment variable is useless until it is properly escaped
T 1710013829 18<22rbox18>	are you sure about that?
T 1710013834 18<20Dus1018>	yes
T 1710013846 18<20Dus1018>	otherwise I wouldn't have asked
T 1710013882 18<22rbox18>	because I have a program that outputs $b, you would agree one has to escape that $
T 1710013885 18<20Dus1018>	It can be assigned to an environment variable, it is just what I do with it afterards that needs it
T 1710013890 18<22rbox18>	but i just do TEST=$(./blah2)
T 1710013892 18<22rbox18>	and it works just fine

T 1710049670 18<19stability18>	bg3?  x4?  i frequently rsync the whole system, with lots of hardlinks which rsync uses up lots of memory calculating.  i was thinking of trying open-world games; dunno if those use lots of memory.  and merely /running/ firefox uses lots of memory for me because i am insane and cannot keep control of ht number of tabs.
T 1710049904 18<27preach18>	I had tired of rsync'ing huge amounts of files all the time and switched to a distributed network filesystem

T 1710049989 18<26fuwu18>	is there a command for automount, the same way a device gets mounted when you plug it in?  (like after you unmounted it with gparted)
T 1710049996 18<27preach18>	that way I don't have to constantly re-scan millions of files looking for changes
T 1710050010 18<27preach18>	gparted is not related to mounting though
T 1710050033 18<26fuwu18>	gparted can unmount devices
T 1710050083 18<26fuwu18>	doesn't matter just assume it is unmounted and you want to run a command to virtually unplug and plug back in the device
T 1710050140 18<27preach18>	well re-plugging is also different than un/mounting
T 1710050226 18<26fuwu18>	that's besides the point
T 1710050314 18<22espresso18>	it does seem rsync can eat some RAM, though it is really fast here on local M.2 and disks. And @stability I meant Baldur's Gate 3 and X4 Foundations. 7 Days to Die (open-world) may use more RAM but haven't crashed it more.
T 1710050334 18<27preach18>	and it can wear down an ssd

T 1710050388 18<27preach18>	that could mean removing power for example
T 1710050397 18<26fuwu18>	i said it's related to unmounting a device, which it is
T 1710050413 18<26fuwu18>	replugging is akin to mounting -- not unmounting
T 1710050442 18<22espresso18>	I usually only rsync *from* ssd, if that matters, and it does not usually read the whole files
T 1710050458 18<26fuwu18>	if a device is unmounted, then if you unplug it and replug it back in it, it will automount

T 1710050544 18<19stability18>	it annoys me that you cannot unmount upon unplugging.  i'd rather just skip automounting until it gets that right.

T 1710050618 18<27preach18>	which to me is more related to 'plugging' than mounting

T 1710051938 18<29ayecee18>	looking at it closer, i think this could not be cancelled. otherwise, dmsetup would have to track the original contents of the blocks that have been merged up to that point, and it probably doesn't.
T 1710052119 18<19vlt18>	ayecee: But maybe – and that’s why I’m asking here first – it can just restart writing the changed blocks and will just not change the ones that already have been written.

T 1710107101 18<22gog18>	it's one way to accomplish it. idk if mdadm does it without complaint as i've never tried that
T 1710107103 18<26hexnewbie18>	I don't think where we are drawing these *particular* scenarios from the question
T 1710107123 18<29tusko18>	AndyCap: I suppose I just want to avoid losing data on some drive because it took a long time to download and would be tedious to get again. I don't think RAID 1 is neccessarily the best option.
T 1710107144 18<26hexnewbie18>	3 RAID 1s of two disks (2*3 = 6) is the only obvious one that comes as interpretation of the question (though there are plenty non-obvious ones, including mixing and matching disks on multiple partitions)
T 1710107163 18<26hexnewbie18>	(or having some 6-way mirrors, some 3-way mirrors and some 2-way mirrors)
T 1710107191 18<29tusko18>	gog: both btrfs and zfs are attractive. I'd just have to learn more about them
T 1710107233 18<27AndyCap18>	tusko: are the drives all different sizes? and do you expect any kind of performance from this?
T 1710107283 18<28Mus118>	tusko, regarding zfs, be aware: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38553008
T 1710107286 18<27AndyCap18>	tusko: have you considered raid-6 for instance?
T 1710107325 18<29tusko18>	We can simplify it a lot, probably. I was looking at getting two drives, same size, and putting those two drives in a mirroring configuration (or another if there is better).
T 1710107408 18<27AndyCap18>	tusko:if you have two drives then mirroring is probably the most useful config.
T 1710107459 18<29tusko18>	I would certainly consider RAID 6 if I had many drives. In this case I was just considering a 2 drive setup for redundancy.
T 1710107470 18<29tusko18>	I wonder, how would I know if a drive failed in such a setup?
T 1710107480 18<27AndyCap18>	tusko: which setup?
T 1710107490 18<29tusko18>	mirroring with 2 drives
T 1710107529 18<28frostschutz18>	tusko, mdadm monitor would send you mail, among other things. of course you have to specify your mail address and setup sendmail or whatever
T 1710107534 18<27AndyCap18>	tusko: you can set up monitoring with md and have it do stuff like email you if it detects a failure, have a look at your distro's docs
T 1710107540 18<27preach18>	RAID10 is the only answer
T 1710107551 18<27preach18>	6 will not scale and can get _very_ slow

T 1710107591 18<29tusko18>	I noticed SMR and CMR drives. Had no idea what that means.

T 1710107597 18<29tusko18>	I should really understand RAID better, too.
T 1710107613 18<27preach18>	replacing one disk in my raidz2 takes 14 days
T 1710107638 18<28frostschutz18>	tusko, SMR is slower than CMR, and not cheap enough to make up for it ;-)
T 1710107659 18<27preach18>	for a single disk SMR is fine IMO. but in RAID it can quickly avalanche
T 1710107668 18<27AndyCap18>	tusko: SMR drives write much larger chunks at a time, but that means more housekeeping
