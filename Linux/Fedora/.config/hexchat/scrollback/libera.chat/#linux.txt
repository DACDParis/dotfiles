I have the resulting JSON just as I would want it, but I need to have it usable on the shell, which would include escaping characters and getting rid of the line breaks.  jq has a filter called @sh for this very purpose, but I keep getting an error: jq: error (at <stdin>:0): object ({"include":...) can not be escaped for shell
T 1710013223 18<22Anjor18>	Could you use a combination of jq filters to extract the necessary data and then manually escape characters and remove line breaks?

T 1710063175 18<22elektrinis18>	so cloudflare is hitting my website files, but displaying an error
T 1710065279 18<26jim18>	elektrinis, dunno if this is the case... but it could be, that you need forward dns for the name (something.com) to IP (12.34.56.78) AND you also need -reverse- dns, meaning IP (12.34.56.78) to name (something.com) (using a dns record called a PTR record)
T 1710066452 18<22elektrinis18>	well it's an internal ip, like 192.168...

T 1710106511 18<26hexnewbie18>	I was once entertaining the removal of the overly complex and kludgy Ceph by running giant LVM VGs with lots of disks, and making RAID-1s between LVs randomly placed on different PVs.
T 1710106626 18<26hexnewbie18>	Problem is, to have the LVs be on different hosts, you have to create a whole lot of iSCSI shares, RAID them on the clients, possibly map a whole bunch of devices to the VMs. Which is like a lot of scripts

T 1710106957 18<27AndyCap18>	tusko: it's technically possible, but if it's a good idea or not is very dependent on what you're planning to use it for and why you think this gives you an advantage

T 1710107325 18<29tusko18>	We can simplify it a lot, probably. I was looking at getting two drives, same size, and putting those two drives in a mirroring configuration (or another if there is better).
T 1710107408 18<27AndyCap18>	tusko:if you have two drives then mirroring is probably the most useful config.
T 1710107459 18<29tusko18>	I would certainly consider RAID 6 if I had many drives. In this case I was just considering a 2 drive setup for redundancy.

T 1710116743 18<29nvz18>	MangoFetish: my opinion is, that all linux distros are capable of being modified and that you choose a distro because of the priorities and particular goals of the distribution. Find one that matches what you're looking for and set it up how you want. I wouldnt use some spinoff of a spinoff kinda distro they generally lack good support

T 1710116788 18<22MangoFetish18>	nvz, do you consider Lubuntu one of those spinoff of a spinoff distros?

T 1710116893 18<29nvz18>	MangoFetish: yes its clearly a spinoff of ubuntu which is a spinoff of debian and from an outside perspective all it offers is making an LXQt desktop which you could achieve with Debian by selecting LXQt in th intall
T 1710116899 18<22MangoFetish18>	Lxqt is liteweight perfection
T 1710116906 18<22MangoFetish18>	really, thats true lol

T 1710116934 18<29nvz18>	MangoFetish: thats the wrong way to approach linux and distros in general is to think of it as the out of box experience rather than the underlying distro's community goals and priorities
T 1710116937 18<22rbox18>	if you likse lxqt, then use it
T 1710116938 18<22MangoFetish18>	Ubuntu gets newer versions of software though right? Debian looks like 10 years old last time I used it
T 1710116940 18<22rbox18>	problem solved
T 1710116949 18<29nvz18>	MangoFetish: in the long run what you will find is far more important is the community behind a distro

T 1710175458 18<26Khaytsus18>	nginx would listen on 80 and 443 and do the proxying for you

T 1710180120 18<22gog18>	iirc grub has a module for lvm volumes
T 1710180169 18<22gog18>	there just has to be enough space for grub-install to embed it. alternatively for UEFI systems the EFI System Partition cannot be within an LVM volume

T 1710180779 18<22peetaur18>	OwlWizard: if you read the docs, they'll say you can boot healthy or degraded on ext4 on mdadm (metadata 0.90, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2; raid 0, 1, 10, 5, 6, etc.) on lvm .....but in my experience only metadata 0.90 or 1.0 and raid 1 or 10 are reliable.
T 1710180824 18<22peetaur18>	and that's why I said raid1 on boot before...   rootfs can be anything else... the initramfs has the job of supporting it and can do anything you configure (eg. maybe a hook script to run a degraded nearly failed raid ...but grub has nothing to do with it so can't fail there)
T 1710180952 18<22peetaur18>	for a machine sitting in front of you it's not so bad ...but if you have to ssh in to fix some boot problem that's just every day stuff like a disk died (happens all the time if you have enough machines), I find it absurd and too much hassle if it can't just boot.

T 1710194473 18<25mdogg18>	In this context, logical volumes can be used to create RAID volumes.
T 1710194492 18<25mdogg18>	So the RAID volume is made up of logical volumes.
T 1710194534 18<25mdogg18>	That's the difference between hardware and software RAID>
T 1710194578 18<25OwlWizard18>	so if i got this right. im going to partition my disk's then group those into logical volumes. and then raid those volumes?
T 1710194678 18<25mdogg18>	If you're using something like btrfs, you can use that to create your volumes for a RAID array, and yes they will be logical volumes.
T 1710194754 18<25OwlWizard18>	im mostly talking about linux lvm rather than btrfs
T 1710194776 18<25OwlWizard18>	or ist btrfs supposed to be installed ontop of that?
T 1710194813 18<25mdogg18>	That makes it easy in case you have say, 6 hard drives in RAID-1.  If a single disk in the array fails, you can tell btrfs which disk failed and that you will be pulling it out.  BTRFS will then move data around so you can remove DISK-x.  Then you can leave it like that or when you replace Disk-x, you can tell btrfs that you did that and it will move data around to accommodate the new replacement.
T 1710194892 18<25mdogg18>	Well, I like using btrfs because it's native to Linux and it can be setup as a typical software RAID volume.
T 1710194896 18<25mdogg18>	But zfs can also be used.
T 1710194964 18<25OwlWizard18>	isnt lvm its own thing?

T 1710195310 18<25mdogg18>	All you can do is start using it.  Make sure you have a backup just in case things get harry and go south.  Everybody was a noob at everything at some point.
T 1710195406 18<25OwlWizard18>	so the most basic thing would be to software raid, my 2 ssd's and put ext4 ont that, i just thought that logical volumes looked neat
T 1710195420 18<25mdogg18>	In openSUSE, by default the OS now likes to create a logical volume for /home under the root partition.  It's labeled @/home.  The advantage is that if root gets too small and @home is pretty big, users have the option of moving space from @/home to their root partition or visa versa.
T 1710195485 18<25mdogg18>	The disadvantage is that if the root partition gets screwed up or if the user bricks the OS by doing something they shouldn't have, their @/home partition with all their data is also impacted because it's a logical volume under the root partition.
T 1710195586 18<25OwlWizard18>	i guess ill just do the normal raid thing with ext4 on that
T 1710195642 18<26Khaytsus18>	Make sure you're doing raid in LInux, not some mobo hardware raid

T 1710195737 18<26hexnewbie18>	Setting up Linux MD RAID is quite straight-forward-ish, even some installers let you do it
T 1710195786 18<25OwlWizard18>	i think the debian installer gives you the option. i now only need to get a drive to backup my install onto
T 1710195843 18<26Khaytsus18>	OwlWizard: Another thing to rememeber.. no matter what RAID you set up, RAID is not backup.  If you delete a file, it's gone.  If your array dies for some reason, etc.  You need to have backups too.
T 1710195888 18<25OwlWizard18>	Khaytsus, im aware of that and i definitly need to do better when it comes to doing backups
T 1710195896 18<26Khaytsus18>	Cool
T 1710195916 18<26Khaytsus18>	Some people are like, but, mirror is a backup, if a drive dies it's still fine!  etc..
T 1710195927 18<25OwlWizard18>	a mirror is for hardware failure

T 1710195996 18<25OwlWizard18>	i want to learn way more about linux but at the moment most of my time is taking up with learning to code
T 1710195997 18<26hexnewbie18>	OwlWizard: You'd probably still have to have LVM involved, though, since you are likely to want to, ahem, partition the RAID (and LVM is much more flexible choice than partitions)
T 1710196025 18<26hexnewbie18>	But in that case it mostly acts as glorified partitioning until you need some of its more advanced features

T 1710205042 18<26akk18>	which might be right -- my problem is that I moved aside prefs.js while testing something, and when I restored the old prefs.js, UBO had forgotten all of its settings
T 1710205068 18<26akk18>	so I'd like to restore them from a backup, but for that I'd need to know where they are

T 1710206358 18<26superkuh18>	I did use -a. I just forgot to have root permissions for the process.
T 1710206377 18<26akk18>	good, then another -a with root should only copy the files that didn't get copied last time

T 1710209080 18<27preach18>	and the hex numbers are just the opcodes that the assembly uses underneath i.e. the actual bytes in the binary at those offsets
T 1710209114 18<27preach18>	maybe you meant to "break main" instead ?
T 1710209181 18<29monkeyPlus18>	so every file, has similiar offsets...but a file on filesystem, is different

T 1710209313 18<29monkeyPlus18>	ah ok, so elf files are different between source and binary?

T 1710209622 18<22espresso18>	monkeyPlus: well the source would be .c, .cpp, .h, .py, whatever like on github, right? gdb works only on compiled binaries, showing virtual offsets (starting at 0) since that's more useful than starting at 0xBAADF00D. binary will be the same in RAM as on FS
T 1710209746 18<22espresso18>	monkeyPlus: text used by the program will be compiled into the binaries, which you can find if you look enough
