T 1708484130 18<25tomman18>	can connect just fine from ISP A (the one supplying the static IP)
T 1708484156 18<25tomman18>	but the server box itself gets to the Internet through ISP B!
T 1708484176 18<25tomman18>	(this dumbfounded me when the box was reporting the wrong public IP to our customer portal)
T 1708484257 18<25tomman18>	In fact most of the boxes on the same LAN go outside via ISP B, dunno what's the role of ISP A here

T 1708509206 18<25mdogg18>	Not really..  You would typically use a pair of virtual Ethernet interfaces to create a connection between namespaces.  One end of the veth pair resides in namespace A, connected to the bridge, while the other end resides in namespace B and can be connected to the interface you want.

T 1708515204 18<25mdogg18>	Harm133: RR bonds are passive optical components.  If you meant something like establishing a direct link using the network interfaces, you would create a point-to-pint network with a crossover cable or use dedicated fiberoptic transceivers.  Then you can configure both interfaces for the same subnet and disable any other network interfaces on the hosts.
T 1708515270 18<25mdogg18>	Bes ure that your firewall rules are setup properly for the new link.
T 1708515708 18<25mdogg18>	Inline: The Wi-Fi interface might not be designed to handle the additional overhead of bridging and routing, leading to instability.  You might try reducing the frequency of ARP announcements, or disabling them completely by adjusting them in ssyctlsettings.  You could also try setting up a separate routing table for your wireless network which may help alleviate some of the issues.

T 1708589436 18<22stallmanator18>	Haha, good point
T 1708589452 18<22stallmanator18>	So are you suggesting I should try openflow (onos right?)
T 1708589457 18<26dminuoso18>	Put it this way, openflow is certainly not a hot growing topic.
T 1708589509 18<26dminuoso18>	There's a bunch of approaches you could all label SDN. We wrote what I dub an SDN compiler that takes a network description and compiles it into configuration that we provision our network infrastructure with. 
T 1708589566 18<26dminuoso18>	Under the hood we use VXLAN+EVPN rather than openflow, mostly because it satisfies our needs and gave us good hardware options.
T 1708589610 18<22stallmanator18>	Vxlan is that used to create virtual switches or something?
T 1708589646 18<26dminuoso18>	VXLAN is a red herring, honestly.
T 1708589675 18<26dminuoso18>	The principal idea is that you have a simple L3 underlay network over which you carry your described network.
T 1708589690 18<26dminuoso18>	So the packages in your described network must be packaged to be carried over that L3 underlay network.
T 1708589735 18<26dminuoso18>	VXLAN takes care of the packaging, EVPN encompasses a set of standards and technologies to exchange discovery of information
T 1708589773 18<26dminuoso18>	So in a way you can use EVPN to build an SDN solution with, much like you can use Openflow - except EVPN is more restrictive in what kind of networking you can accomplish.
T 1708589909 18<26dminuoso18>	In our case, you just declare a bunch of interfaces to participate in a VRF, then the SDN compiler will generate all the necessary configuration. EVPN will then help connect everything together while the packages between the interfaces will be VXLAN encapsulated and send according to some routing information (mediated by EVPN)
T 1708590132 18<22stallmanator18>	Vrf?
T 1708590152 18<22stallmanator18>	Oh

T 1708590266 18<22stallmanator18>	Not sure what all this complicated stuff is achieving
T 1708590302 18<26dminuoso18>	stallmanator: So we have a bunch of datacenters. Sometimes we want a server one rack and a server in another rack be able to talk to each other.
T 1708590302 18<26dminuoso18>	Or we have a server that just wants internet connectivity.
T 1708590369 18<22stallmanator18>	And these servers are not necessarily in the same datacenter right? Because otherwise it makes little sense
T 1708590383 18<26dminuoso18>	Maybe, maybe not, it does not matter.
T 1708590462 18<26dminuoso18>	Even within the same data center, its just effort that can go wrong.
T 1708590501 18<26dminuoso18>	Our approach has multiple considerations:
T 1708590564 18<26dminuoso18>	a) encapsulation: means the underlay cant see the packages, that simplifies architectural choices and we can carry different protocols (l2 or l3 routed traffic) over the same network.
T 1708590576 18<26dminuoso18>	and because its encapsulated, transporting l2 is safe, no risk of loops
T 1708590619 18<26dminuoso18>	b) horizontal scalability: we can just add switches and increase total throughput of the entire network, no hierarchial design with extremely expensive high performance switches or routers needed.
T 1708590669 18<26dminuoso18>	c) removing the human factor: no screwup in configuration, no bgp errors, no outages.
T 1708590695 18<26dminuoso18>	d) we have optimization potential, because at compilation time we know the hierarchy of the network, we can guide VXLAN/EVPN to carry traffic certain ways
T 1708590719 18<26dminuoso18>	e) we get to employ formal techniques to analyze the entire network for problems before we push it into configuration
T 1708590831 18<19needle18>	Nothing to add to this. Good explanation and a good plan.
T 1708590926 18<19needle18>	Maybe that such a EVPN/BGP fabric can be build using cheap pizza boxes routers, and everything is protocol based. Instead of using expencive one box highly redundant gear.
T 1708591029 18<19needle18>	and it is super scalable once set up.

T 1708625295 18<26minimal18>	for each (v)lan you have 1 or more subnets (i.e. 1 IPv4, 1 IPv6 if you're using that)
T 1708625333 18<26minimal18>	traffic between (v)lan subnets require a router that is attached to multiple (v)lans
T 1708625385 18<25tomman18>	OK, so that means I need a VLAN-aware router too.
T 1708625413 18<25tomman18>	not just the switches
T 1708625482 18<26minimal18>	well typically a router would be connected to a "trunk" switch port
T 1708625506 18<26minimal18>	you have a router that doesn't understand VLANs?
T 1708625506 18<25tomman18>	that's a word I've seen mentioned many times in the literature I'm reading, yes
T 1708625519 18<25tomman18>	At this stage we have NOTHING
T 1708625523 18<25tomman18>	we will start from scratch
T 1708625540 18<25tomman18>	the current network is "a bunch of dumb switches and a RouterBoard"
T 1708625572 18<26minimal18>	you don't strictly need to have a VLAN-aware router, you could connect multiple router interfaces to the switch with each switch port being for a specific VLAN....but that's not something typially done
T 1708625594 18<25tomman18>	ha, I was thinking on that :D
T 1708625611 18<26minimal18>	but if for example you want to have 50 VLANs then you'd need a router with 50 ethernet interfaces lol
T 1708625638 18<25tomman18>	Fortunately in this case I already identified that we won't need more than 4 or 5 VLANs
T 1708625643 18<26minimal18>	whereas typically you'd have a single ethernet interface connected to a single trunk switch port
T 1708625767 18<26minimal18>	"the current network is "a bunch of dumb switches and a RouterBoard" - but you're not talking about the current network, you're talking about changing to new VLAN-capable switches etc
T 1708625785 18<25tomman18>	yeah, hence why my "we're starting from scratch" remark
T 1708625790 18<25tomman18>	right now we have nothing
T 1708625796 18<25tomman18>	just a blank canvas
T 1708625879 18<26minimal18>	so then you should really get a VLAN capable router
T 1708625958 18<25tomman18>	OK, I COULD salvage the Routerboard they have right now, if it has the right feature set for that
T 1708625972 18<25tomman18>	it's a RB750Gr3
T 1708625987 18<25tomman18>	otherwise I'll tell them to "buy something else on top of the switches"
T 1708626147 18<25tomman18>	ha, now I need to pick between "IEEE 802.1Q", "Cisco VTP" and "something else"
T 1708626339 18<26minimal18>	tomman: sounds like you need to spend some time reading docs about VLANs to actually understand it

T 1708626391 18<26minimal18>	so then why are your making recommendations to someone about something you don't (currently) understand?
T 1708626414 18<25tomman18>	They have no other options
T 1708626425 18<25tomman18>	again, I got involved on this for $RAISNS
T 1708626511 18<26minimal18>	and you're not concerned that you might make incorrect recommendations based on not (fully) understanding things?
T 1708626536 18<25tomman18>	I'm well aware of that, and they are also well aware of that too

T 1708627311 18<26minimal18>	I assume they're expecting you get out Wireshark, capture SMB/CIFS traffic from/to their app and diagnose why things aren't working from that lol
T 1708627412 18<20rpifan18>	so there an application that has a fixed domain name on it, it uses this name to send log data. we are migrating the server the server that it sends to but it needs to be under a new name, ideally we'd keep both servers connected to get the data. is there a way to accomplish that? maybe using nginx redirection or some kind of fancy ip trick?
T 1708627602 18<26elf18>	can the application send log data to multiple destinations simultaneously? eg as syslog can
T 1708627631 18<26elf18>	if so, build the new log server, merge the two log sets after the fact
T 1708627669 18<20rpifan18>	afaik i dont think so, it seems the application pushes data to our sentry instance
T 1708627671 18<20rpifan18>	using a token
T 1708627676 18<26elf18>	or you could get all fancy with some sort of load balancing / distributed log forwarder in front of the multiple log servers if HA is that important
T 1708627711 18<20rpifan18>	nah this is meant to be a temporary solution until the log errors match up in the new server.
T 1708627717 18<20rpifan18>	since we can't migrate all of the old logs
T 1708627764 18<26elf18>	well... maybe you just need to be really quick when swapping the IP from the old -> new log server :)
T 1708627847 18<25tomman18>	ha, the user manual of the TP-Stink managed switches have exactly the "different departments" usecase I actually need
T 1708627956 18<26elf18>	tomman, typically most orgs have a router with firewall functionality and an interface in each subnet/vlan
T 1708627957 18<20Allie18>	tomman: it's almost as if they're quite good switches for the right usecase :D
T 1708628008 18<25tomman18>	it's kinda barebones, but the explanation seems relatively simple to grasp
T 1708628080 18<25tomman18>	ah, "trunk port" is a "tagged port" in non-Cisco-ese
T 1708628086 18<25tomman18>	--Cisco-ese
T 1708628098 18<25tomman18>	of course there had to be Cisco and non-Cisco lingo for the same shit
T 1708628322 18<25tomman18>	"access" = untagged port = plug computers here
T 1708628341 18<25tomman18>	"trunk" = tagged port = plug VLAN-aware switches and routers here
T 1708628346 18<25tomman18>	OK, I now understand that part

T 1708628700 18<20rpifan18>	or i wonder if i can just set a dns to change the name from the old to the new
T 1708628719 18<22baldpope18>	tomman, trunk -> also for servers that are multi-homed

T 1708676478 18<25Lope18>	I need to decide how to architect my network/infrastructure, any opinions, relevant experiences, comments or suggestions will be appreciated.
T 1708676499 18<25Lope18>	The way I have it currently is I have an internet-router, that provides internet to all the other VM's
T 1708676567 18<25Lope18>	Then I've got what I call a service-router, it does SSL-termination, SSL passthrough, pihole and dnsmasq for my local network, it also hosts a VPN server so all my things can connect to my other things.
T 1708676585 18<25Lope18>	things being movable things like laptops etc.
T 1708676611 18<25Lope18>	Now I'm introducing LTE, so I'm not only reliant on fiber.
T 1708676622 18<25Lope18>	So naturally the internet-router should do that, obviously.
T 1708676657 18<25Lope18>	However that changes things a bit. Because normally incoming connections come to the internet-router and it DNAT's them to the service-router.
T 1708676668 18<25Lope18>	However when I'm on LTE, can't get incoming connections on the LTE
T 1708676730 18<25Lope18>	So what I've done as a temporary workaround is I manually establish a VPN connection from my service-router to a VPS somewhere. Then I manually run a script that updates the A records of all my hostnames to the VPS IP.
T 1708676751 18<25Lope18>	Then the incoming connections go to the VPS, through the VPN to my service-router directly.
T 1708676766 18<25Lope18>	So this is where my architecture has become messy.
T 1708676784 18<25Lope18>	Because my service-router now needs to KNOW when the internet-router is using LTE
T 1708676807 18<25Lope18>	Normally the internet-router was updating all the hostnames' A records to the dynamic internet IP.
T 1708676831 18<25Lope18>	I suppose the internet-router could also update the A records to the VPS's IP.
T 1708676845 18<25Lope18>	but since the internet-router isn't managing the VPN that seems bad.
T 1708676920 18<25Lope18>	So it seems obvious that my internet-router should be setting up the VPN connection, but the reason why I don't do it is that I don't need all outgoing traffic to go through the VPN.
T 1708676981 18<25Lope18>	The reason why the service-router's outgoing traffic needs to go through the VPN, is that the VPS does DNAT to the service-router. And the service-router's services can't reply if it's default route isn't the VPS, so the traffic can go back out the way it came in.
T 1708677028 18<25Lope18>	I'm not a NAT expert. I've seen some indication that potentially SNAT would solve that issue. But my networking skills are in dodgy territory at that point.
T 1708677071 18<25Lope18>	I'm a programmer so obviously I have no problem making my service-router monitor the connection status on my internet-router.
T 1708677081 18<25Lope18>	But it just SEEMS MESSY.
T 1708677095 18<25Lope18>	And mess now normally equals problems later.

T 1708682467 18<25Daniel18>	you should be able to use different clients depending on the type of VPN server

T 1708721221 18<19ishan18>	Hi, I am trying to setup snmp monitoring for my rb5009. I have added a snmp exporter on mikrotik(config: https://paste.debian.net/plainh/703c7fba) and I am using a telegraf for the snmp trap server.

T 1709233131 18<27catphish18>	there's no way we can really guess without knowing how the server generates and sends the data, or how the clients receive or process it

T 1709233418 18<24Harm13318>	catphish how so? The clients are showing differing behaviour, I don't understand how the server would be the cause?
T 1709233449 18<27catphish18>	to be clear though, iperf3 gives the full 10G speed to both clients?
T 1709233495 18<24Harm13318>	by my recollection, yes
T 1709233499 18<27catphish18>	if so, clearly the hardware isn't the problem, and the OS isn't the problem, and since you swapped out the receiver with nc, it's reeasonable to assume that's not the problem either
T 1709233508 18<27catphish18>	that only leaves the server, right?
T 1709233612 18<24Harm13318>	well, yesterday I was playing around with the rx ring buffer size on the slower client
T 1709233623 18<24Harm13318>	increasing it from 256 to 4k improved performance by 15%~
T 1709233638 18<24Harm13318>	so that would point ot the client side again
T 1709233695 18<27catphish18>	i think you need to do a simpler test with a single plain tcp socket at each end sending dummy data as fast as possible

T 1709275917 18<26dminuoso18>	And by routability I mean that, in both directions, there is routes along the entire path for your desired connection.
T 1709275938 18<26dminuoso18>	From your perspective, your router (and the router behind it) need either a default route (or be in the DFZ)

T 1709276135 18<26dminuoso18>	marcopolo1: In fact, by its very definition, a router necessarily always has two routes at minimum.
T 1709276153 18<26dminuoso18>	Because a router connects multiple networks, so at minimum it will have a route for each of those networks it is connected to

T 1709276358 18<26dminuoso18>	This is something where in smaller and simpler cases the company might provide a VPN - but that requires exposing that stack over the internet.
T 1709276389 18<26dminuoso18>	Which is why something like this only happens for larger shops where the cost of that separate infrastructure is considered worth to combat the security risks of exposing a VPN in the internet.
T 1709276409 18<26Cowclops18>	So like my pfsense router knows what the next hop is because you set an upstream gateway IP. But thats the most boring version of routing (just taking a singular upstream gateway and doing nat from lan IPs to wan IPs and the nsending it to the next hop which is on the same subnet but knowing nothing else about how the internet is wired)

T 1709276597 18<26dminuoso18>	marcopolo1: No, not a $path actually!
T 1709276603 18<20mlu18>	marcopolo1: the router reads the IP address and figures out which path to send you on (i.e. what's the next hop)
T 1709276613 18<26Cowclops18>	but its like a 16 way intersection and there are 6GB of data to let you know which way each path goes to
T 1709276617 18<26dminuoso18>	marcopolo1: But your thought was good, and there exist other notions than routes that more closely resemble paths.
T 1709276627 18<26dminuoso18>	mlu: A route is really just a "next hop" bit of that path.
T 1709276638 18<26dminuoso18>	So if you think of a path of a set of sections, then a route is a singular section of that path.
T 1709276642 18<20mlu18>	yep
T 1709276657 18<20mlu18>	ie. I have a few subnets within my intranet (think: three LANs)
T 1709276677 18<26dminuoso18>	marcopolo1: as a consequence, no single router knows about the path of the connection - and the path back might be different too.
T 1709276678 18<20mlu18>	when a router sees a packet, it will read the destination IP address and decide where to send it
T 1709276693 18<20mlu18>	and if it doesn't match my three LANs and is a valid IP address, it goes to the default route (i.e. up to the itnernet)
T 1709276701 18<26Cowclops18>	BGP, OSPF, and the like (not completely interchangeable but work on the same premise of "deciding what route a packet should take") are dynamic so you a router gets a table that says "if your destination is this address, your next hop is this router"
T 1709276716 18<26Cowclops18>	But you can make a much simpler example at home with static routing tables
T 1709276739 18<25marcopolo118>	So it looks into its dns and if it doesnt find anything it sends it to the next router until one knows something ?
T 1709276747 18<20mlu18>	marcopolo1: not exactly
T 1709276752 18<26Cowclops18>	The routing table is really what tells it where to go, how the routing table gets populated is what makes for the difference between bgp, ospf, and just static routes
T 1709276763 18<20mlu18>	marcopolo1: tehre's literally a table -- it matches the most specific route
T 1709276765 18<26Cowclops18>	Nah, DNS just turns it into the address
T 1709276790 18<26Cowclops18>	But lots of companies own lots of IP network blocks, so to know where data needs to go on the PUBLIC INTERNET is massive
T 1709276792 18<20mlu18>	marcopolo1: i.e. on a typical LAN router, you'd have something like 192.168.1.0/24 routes to the LAN, 0.0.0.0/0 goes upstream (to the internet)
T 1709276809 18<26Cowclops18>	On the flip side you could setup OSFP "inside" a corporate network, so that if you fire up a new router with new subnets it can let the other routers know how to get to it

T 1709276956 18<26dminuoso18>	marcopolo1: "a default route" (one for 0.0.0.0/0) is generally considered "least matching", and its in that sense that it is a "default route", because it acts as a catch all networks you do not have better/more specific routes for.
T 1709276973 18<25marcopolo118>	So if 192.168.1.0/24 sends a request to google, it routes it to 0.0.0.0/0?
