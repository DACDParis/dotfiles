I have (setq tab-bar-mode t) and (setq tab-bar-show t) in my init.el. The tabs are shown at startup, but I need to do "M-x tab-bar-mode" twice, to turn it off and on again, then the keys work.

T 1710102061 18<20corwin18>	I think you might want to start it with a function call, rather than by setting the variable.  E.g. something in your init scripts like (tab-bar-mode 1)
T 1710102152 18<20corwin18>	Looks like if you set it via customize it should take effect, actually > Setting this variable directly does not take effect; either customize it (see the info node ‘Easy Customization’) or call the function ‘tab-bar-mode’.
T 1710102167 18<20corwin18>	So, you can probably just do (setopt tab-bar-mode t)
T 1710102278 18<27sham118>	Yeah, customize plays special tricks with stuff

If you have something it init.el (ignoring use-package, for the moment), you should likely be calling the global-minor-mode's function, or else using setopt on the minor-mode var.

T 1710151742 18<28alcor18>	angry_vincent: You might want to look into `package-install-file', passing it the tar.xz Archive for ebuild-mode
T 1710151846 18<28alcor18>	angry_vincent: That aside, I would expect the mode to work even on remote files via TRAMP. TRAMP is a powerful remote access facility that allows for comfortable editing of files on remote systems, and any locally-installed modes usually work on remote files just as well as they do on local files.

T 1710154122 18<20pkal18>	Highly biased, I'd say.  I haven't used projectile (horrible name btw) for a few years now, so I cannot really comment on the differences.  I've contributed to project.el and like the API.  Being built-in also means that more packages tend to make use of it, than with some third-party packages.

T 1710154381 18<20pkal18>	In general, I'd recommend trying out built-in packages first.  If something is missing, it might be worth trying to implement it yourself (e.g. project didn't have project-compile, so I wrote a patch) or create a feature request.  It is usually not that difficult to extend the code, it's just that the maintainers didn't know about that use-case.

T 1710244168 18<24Odin-LAP18>	My guess would be that because info is designed for long-form and reference manuals, the assumption is that either you're reading through the nodes or looking for a specific function. In the first case, the prose text should be providing the information and you don't need a summary list, and in the latter case you're assumed not to care which node it's in so the full index is enough.
T 1710244436 18<19twb18>	If you are used to man, the way you make info work like man is "info emacs | less"

T 1710244506 18<19twb18>	I don't know about the info manual, but you can do M-x apropos-function RET or similar to get a report like that

That aside, Emacs is just a tool you can use for common sysadmin tasks – editing files, taking notes, doing some scripting. As a SysAdmin you're probably going to do lots of things on remote systems via SSH, so perhaps look into things like TRAMP, dired, and wdired because you'll use them a lot for remote system
