T 1708646682 18*	24Odin-LAP had a notion of using SVG as the basis for a GUI system back in 2002 or 2001.

T 1708646804 18<29wgreenhouse18>	maybe better in a browser than anywhere else as it is an xml _document_
T 1708646818 18<24Odin-LAP18>	SVG is actually stupid well supported, it's just not a banner feature of anything.
T 1708646833 18<28technomancy18>	I really ought to add some color to that page tho
T 1708646859 18<29wgreenhouse18>	Odin-LAP: still shocking that not every xmpp client will work with svg avatars :P

T 1708646954 18<28technomancy18>	democracy works!!
T 1708646983 18<28technomancy18>	my favorite stupid fact about PNG is that the official logo for PNG actually renders terribly as a PNG and is much better as a JPG

T 1708647148 18<20johnjaye18>	is tiff lossless? hmmm
T 1708647180 18<24Odin-LAP18>	johnjaye: TIFF allows multiple compression formats, most of which are lossless.
T 1708647210 18<24Odin-LAP18>	johnjaye: However, JPEG is not, and it's fairly common in TIFF.

T 1708647328 18<20johnjaye18>	right. i mean it's nice to have one format for lossy and one for lossless
T 1708647403 18<19e1f18>	there was probably a good reason why they chose png over svg-- it's possible that at one time, one or more of the browsers they tested the site against couldn't render svg images. i speak from experience having received well-meaning suggestions from random people about how to improve things
T 1708647524 18<24Odin-LAP18>	e1f: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's actually the reason they had. That reason had just gone away by the point I brought it up, and I think I was careful to mention that I didn't think anyone had made a mistake.

T 1708650186 18<28technomancy18>	there's been a lot of shit takes about section 230 going around lately

T 1708662236 18<24rudybot18>	bpalmer: there could be text objects for those things. the text-object commands are grouped into "secondary-modals", and implemented as command overrides. when you hit 'd' in modal-cmd-mode, it puts you into modal-1off-kill-mode, which overrides commands like "next-line" to alternatives which find a text object corresponding to that movement. i went with this design because it automatically uses your favorite binding for "next-line"

T 1708708826 18<20thuna`18>	corwin's suggestion is probably what you are looking for but it would be nice if you could explain the context behind this snippet.
T 1708708886 18<27hab2518>	thuna`: thanks, your solution is an improvement. I'd love it if I could avoid writing "transient-mark-mode" twice though since that is more error prone. In this case my `my/setq-with-boundp-and-type-check` does a `boundp` check practically eliminates the chance of a mistyping error (you'd have to mistype to another bound symbol)
T 1708708951 18<27hab2518>	thuna: but nonetheless it would be cool if there was a solution for this typing twice problem that worked in the general case where there is not a `boundp` check afterwords
T 1708708981 18<20corwin18>	Isn't transient-mark-mode the mode var for transient mark, a global minor mode, thus always buffer local?
T 1708709045 18<27hab2518>	thuna`: The reason `my/setq-with-boundp-and-type-check` is a macro is to mirror the interface of `setq`. This is only possible through a macro since `setq` is a special form
T 1708709060 18<20corwin18>	Hmm.  Disabling it gives me "disabled" not "disabled in current buffer", so perhaps not.
T 1708709098 18<20thuna`18>	corwin: transient-mark-mode doesn't seem to be buffer-local, since it's dv doesn't have a "this variable automatically becomes buffer-local when set"
T 1708709148 18<20corwin18>	hab25: So, it's to avoid having to quote the symbol given as the first arg? (FTR, I think I asked "why a macro" first ;)
T 1708709185 18<20thuna`18>	hab25: That "mistype-protection" is very much not a good idea.  As for `-and-type-check', it's not obvious to me how you would specify how to type-check with how you are calling the macro, so it seems overall redundant

T 1708709478 18<27hab2518>	Trust is not absolute, humans make mistakes. That is part of the motivation for writing tests.

T 1709573306 18<20lispmacs[work]18>	I have been moving many of my usual shell calls into Emacs interactive functions, but a downside is that Emacs, unlike Gnome console, does not send a notification to you when a command completes

T 1709573460 18<20corwin18>	lispmacs[work]: I think one typical solution here could be dbus.  Your programs might send notifications that way, and too Emacs has the `dbus' package.
T 1709573665 18<20lispmacs[work]18>	corwin: well, sending the notification is easy, since notify-send is already available, but the question is how does Emacs now to run another command once the command run by async-shell-command is finished?
T 1709573704 18<20lispmacs[work]18>	I could of course add "&& notify-send" onto the end of the command, but was looking for some way to make that implicit

T 1709675750 18<20bpalmer18>	I'm a little rusty so my examples aren't great, but imagine you're tracking purchases of people and displaying for each user how much they've spent in total. A classic denormalized model might be something like Account(id, name, ...)  and Purchase(id, account_id, foreign key (account_id) references account(id), itemname, cost)
T 1709675796 18<29quiliro18>	I thought you were talking about joins in elisp
T 1709675812 18<20bpalmer18>	so the classic relational way would be to do a join and sum across those tables. And when an account is deleted, you're going to be locking the purchase table and deleting all rows that reference the account.

T 1709675931 18<20bpalmer18>	then sometime after your business closes, you go through a list of all the deleted accounts, and remove them from the purchase table. Similarly, you deal with all returned purchases in bulk and subtract them from the RunningSum table

T 1709707728 18<22RickAstley18>	How do I tell emacs minibuffer it should always use a certain path?
T 1709707749 18<20bpalmer18>	RickAstley: what do you mean?
T 1709707754 18<22RickAstley18>	For instance I always want it to go to home when I find file. Not the current directory
T 1709707779 18<22RickAstley18>	bpalmer: using helm-find-file I always want it to start at ~/ not current dir
T 1709707788 18<22RickAstley18>	Although I want this behavior to change depending on the major mode
T 1709707825 18<29wgreenhouse18>	RickAstley: see ,,dv read-file-name-function
T 1709707825 18<22fsbot18>	The function called by ‘read-file-name’ to do its work.
T 1709707825 18<22fsbot18>	It should accept the same arguments as ‘read-file-name’.
T 1709707825 18<22fsbot18>	Defined in `/usr/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/minibuffer.elc'.
T 1709707827 18<20bpalmer18>	RickAstley: by default, find file (and thus probably helm-find-file) will use the path in default-directory to start from
T 1709707851 18<20bpalmer18>	RickAstley: you can simply set this value (such as with M-x cd RET ), either interactively, or in your mode hook
T 1709707893 18<29wgreenhouse18>	or, yeah, manipulate default-directory (which is buffer local) from a mode hook--better than defining a new read-file-name-function. :)

T 1709707963 18<22RickAstley18>	any way to bookmark / mark this IRC fragment with circe and org-remark
T 1709708224 18<22RickAstley18>	Wondering if there's a way to save circe-channel-mode in like a text file as an irc log then highlight stuff
T 1709708281 18<22RickAstley18>	I see there's erclogging...
T 1709708326 18<22RickAstley18>	wasamasa: where do I read about how to log with circe
T 1709708344 18<20bpalmer18>	you can just copy and paste things into a text file.
T 1709708361 18<20bpalmer18>	otherwise, I believe circe has a logging module, but you'll have to check its documentation
T 1709708384 18<22RickAstley18>	how do I pull up manual on emacs package I always forget this
T 1709708397 18<22RickAstley18>	M-x info no circe entry :/

T 1709708800 18<22RickAstley18>	circe doesn't log until buffer killed and if you kill buffer it leaves the channel :/
T 1709708857 18<20bpalmer18>	that doesn't seem like it's useful behavior, so I wonder if you might be misinterpreting something
T 1709709125 18<22RickAstley18>	odd, circe logs even when the buffer isn't killed
T 1709709130 18<22RickAstley18>	idk why the docs say that
T 1709709133 18<22RickAstley18>	I'll update them
T 1709709428 18<22RickAstley18>	can someone replay for me the question I asked before I was asking about logging and what the answer was
T 1709709446 18<22RickAstley18>	idk if there's a bot here for that
T 1709709560 18<22RickAstley18>	I wonder if someone sent me weird unicode if the write file could pwn me :D
T 1709709852 18<24bkhl18>	Certainly stuff like this can happen with bugs in UTF-8 parsing: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2008-37/
T 1709711057 18<26Viking66718>	pffft. No luck searching for an oil painter called Minteer. I can see pictures, but no biographical data on them whatsoever aside from their having painted in the 1940s and '50s.
T 1709711352 18<26Viking66718>	 I'm also not having much luck with another artist simply titled H. Carter.
T 1709715044 18<28philipp_18>	When I use M-x compile, why does the command run in some other directory, but not in the directory of the current file or in default-directory?
T 1709715073 18<28philipp_18>	Nevermind, I was using recompile instead of compile.
T 1709715812 18<26Viking66718>	And here was I thinking that compile actually compiled emacs. It doesn't, but I guess it could be taught how - I went the bash script route, but there's no reason I couldn't have figured out how to do it from within Emacs itself - the only problem being replacing the running binary.
