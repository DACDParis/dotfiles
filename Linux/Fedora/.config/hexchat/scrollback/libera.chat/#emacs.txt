T 1709573306 18<20lispmacs[work]18>	I have been moving many of my usual shell calls into Emacs interactive functions, but a downside is that Emacs, unlike Gnome console, does not send a notification to you when a command completes

T 1709573333 18<20corwin18>	technomancy: "this stuff" (everything is cHat, actually) has been getting gradually more of my attention for some time now.  I have a "make it all a daemon" project going as of this weekend, so maybe I'll even publish it somewhere for people to wrinkle their brows at.  It's a crap ton of shell and perl scripts atm, badly failing DRY

T 1709573460 18<20corwin18>	lispmacs[work]: I think one typical solution here could be dbus.  Your programs might send notifications that way, and too Emacs has the `dbus' package.
T 1709573665 18<20lispmacs[work]18>	corwin: well, sending the notification is easy, since notify-send is already available, but the question is how does Emacs now to run another command once the command run by async-shell-command is finished?
T 1709573704 18<20lispmacs[work]18>	I could of course add "&& notify-send" onto the end of the command, but was looking for some way to make that implicit

T 1709659816 18<28technomancy18>	I wouldn't trust anyone at a director level to assess the accuracy of any code (but a director at tesla/openAI much, much less)

T 1709661303 18<29weary-traveler18>	if this is a development machine where you don't have admin privileges, it increases the utility of having something like nix or guix. might not be easy, but might be worth the effort, but that is indeed for you to decide

T 1709665273 18<29davemq18>	To be a little pedantic, TCP doesn't deal in messages, it deals in a stream of octets. You can get a 0 length read for EOF OR for a non-blocking read, though IIRC a non-blocking read typically returns -1 and sets an errno like EWOULDBLOCK
T 1709665368 18<19wasamasa18>	sham1: in any case, my point is that a torrent client is quite the expedition into uncharted waters and I stopped working on it since I ran out of time :(

T 1709675321 18<27sham118>	Or what do you mean by patching up
T 1709675750 18<20bpalmer18>	I'm a little rusty so my examples aren't great, but imagine you're tracking purchases of people and displaying for each user how much they've spent in total. A classic denormalized model might be something like Account(id, name, ...)  and Purchase(id, account_id, foreign key (account_id) references account(id), itemname, cost)
T 1709675796 18<29quiliro18>	I thought you were talking about joins in elisp
T 1709675812 18<20bpalmer18>	so the classic relational way would be to do a join and sum across those tables. And when an account is deleted, you're going to be locking the purchase table and deleting all rows that reference the account.

T 1709675878 18<20bpalmer18>	but you could also just write into Purchase without ever joining back into Account table, and also keep a RunningSum(account id, total)  table that you just add to at the same time that you insert into purchase
T 1709675931 18<20bpalmer18>	then sometime after your business closes, you go through a list of all the deleted accounts, and remove them from the purchase table. Similarly, you deal with all returned purchases in bulk and subtract them from the RunningSum table

T 1709753185 18<27nij-18>	The emacs bytecode VM is the internal core to emacs. Elisp code gets compiled to instructions for that VM, and the VM then controls the other part of emacs.

T 1709824874 18<20pkal18>	ndegruchy: If this is of any use, in a Scheme-like language macro could be handled this way by a meta-interpreter: (apply func (map (if (macro? func) eval identity) args))
T 1709824876 18<27ndegruchy18>	NotThatRPG: You can kill the connection (or try, anyway) from that buffer, but it might be interesting to poke around and see why it's stuck 'open'. Maybe it's set to keep connections alive for long-lived editing processes. I know my default config requires TRAMP to reconnect constantly

T 1709849251 18<19ldb18>	thuna`: are you sure? because nobody uses the real sendmail command line program today, they all using some kind of command compatible to it though. msmtp is a popular one, postfix or exim provides sendmail command but that requires a admin that knows how to set things up.
T 1709849296 18<19ldb18>	if you have not setup non of these, then likely you are using smtpmail, which uses `smtpmail-mail-address'

For the record, neither mail-envelope-from nor smtpmail-mail-address seem to effect the result, though setting the X-Message-SMTP-Method header to "smtp smtp.gmail.com ADDRESS" does work so I will set message-server-alist to do that.
T 1709849690 18<20corwin18>	Necktwi: Please don't test client connection/autojoin/etc settings in a channel with hundreds of people.  The network has ##test ##test2 .. ##testn for this.  Maybe run another client to chat with us here while you bounce with the other in and out of ##test?
T 1709849847 18<19ldb18>	thuna`: if X-Message-SMTP-Method then it is smtpmail.el, you need also set `mail-specify-envelope-from' to t to have it acknowledge mail-envelope-from

T 1710102061 18<20corwin18>	I think you might want to start it with a function call, rather than by setting the variable.  E.g. something in your init scripts like (tab-bar-mode 1)

T 1710103010 18<22sneezle18>	dcb: I don't have a `custom.el`. Emacs did write once or twice user customizations in the `init.el` - is `custom.el` the place where those customizations belong? Like setting a theme?
T 1710103044 18<20corwin18>	if you use custom then you are implicitly using setopt.  or smth. anyway, you engage the "magic" of customize for changing variables according to the needs of the packages that create said customizations.  If you have something it init.el (ignoring use-package, for the moment), you should likely be calling the global-minor-mode's function, or else using setopt on the minor-mode var.
T 1710103093 18<20corwin18>	custom.el is, I assume, the value of `custom-file', which just let's us extract the ugly "don't mess with me" stuff that customize saves to another file.
T 1710103181 18<27sham118>	Yeah, that's exactly it
T 1710103187 18<19dcb18>	sneezle: yes, it's the file where I keep the customization done through `customize` and friends: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Saving-Customizations.html
T 1710103189 18<27sham118>	IIRC you also have to load it manually
T 1710103203 18<27sham118>	So just (load custom-file) at the bottom of the init.el
T 1710103228 18<27sham118>	I also use my custom-file for site-local functionality, since I have it on .gitignore
T 1710103233 18<20corwin18>	Yeah, that's an important gotcha with `custom-file', (as far as I know) it does not automatically require our "custom.el" or whatever. We need to ensure that happens by adding something like (setq custom-file "custom.el") and then (require "custom.el")
T 1710103240 18<27sham118>	Anything that needs to be synced is in init.el or early-init.el
T 1710103268 18<20corwin18>	Or maybe I mean load-library.  I'm pretty sure that's what I use, but I suspect it probably doesn't matter very much.
T 1710103280 18<27sham118>	Just (load) works
