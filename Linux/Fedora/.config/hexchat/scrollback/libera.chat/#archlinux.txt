T 1702314891 18<28Exa18>	Hello, I just installed a PCI card with wi-fi and bluetooth but I don't need the wi-fi part, I'm wondering if there is something that can be disabled so that it doesn't look for networks needlessly.  I only have dhdpcd and systemd-networkd enabled that could trigger this, or maybe I could blacklist iwlwifi (the module that is loaded).  Note that I don't want to disable the bluetooth part, but I would not be surprised if it works as a pair.  Thanks.

T 1702315105 18<28Exa18>	MacGyver: can it be done at boot (I mean I can write a systemd unit for that but there could be a better way)?
T 1702315124 18<27MacGyver18>	Exa: The default configuration we ship remembers rfkill state, I think.
T 1702315182 18<27MacGyver18>	Exa: I might be wrong -- see whether you see log messages for "Starting Load/Save RF Kill Switch Status..." in the journal when you execute rfkill.
T 1702315232 18<27MacGyver18>	Exa: If you want to configure it for a device you provision, i.e. it has to happen at *first* boot, I can look up how exactly that works again but it sounds like that's not the issue.
T 1702315235 18<28Exa18>	MacGyver: I have the systemd-rfkill unit already started (before running anything)
T 1702315250 18<28Exa18>	hmm, it's a static unit
T 1702315271 18<27MacGyver18>	Exa: Yes but that doesn't mean it actually *blocks*, it just applies rfkill state.
T 1702315278 18<27MacGyver18>	Exa: By default that's unblocked.
T 1702315284 18<29Pikk3wyn18>	it does remember in the default config
T 1702315288 18<27MacGyver18>	Exa: You actually have to make a change.
T 1702315303 18<29Pikk3wyn18>	Exa: it should show in the log of systemctl status systemd-rfkill.service
T 1702315314 18<29Pikk3wyn18>	whether it saved/loaded the state
T 1702315320 18<28Exa18>	MacGyver: it did start something when I have run the rfkill command
T 1702315346 18<27MacGyver18>	Exa: Then it's supposed to have saved rfkill state and will (attempt to) apply that at next boot.
T 1702315381 18<27MacGyver18>	Exa: If you now run `rfkill` without argument you'll see wlan listed as "blocked" under SOFT.
T 1702315428 18<28Exa18>	it saved something in /var/lib/systemd/rfkill (checked the manual).  I'm going to reboot to check if bluetooth is still there

T 1702315732 18<22rapha18>	Hi all! In my xrandr output, there is a 3rd screen (besides builtin and HDMI) called "None-2-1" ... what could that be caused by, and can i get rid of it? (this is an Nvidia Optimus laptop with Optimus disabled in the BIOS ... could it be related to that?)
T 1702315883 18<29Pikk3wyn18>	rapha: it's probably related, and it's unlikely you can get rid of it
T 1702315895 18<25nathan18>	I assume it's disconnected? My laptop shows disconnected "screens" in xrandr that could be connected via usb-c

T 1702316214 18<29Pikk3wyn18>	does it only appear with optimus disabled?
T 1702316239 18<27MacGyver18>	Exa: "Hard blocked" is usually only set when the device is disabled at UEFI level or has some kind of in-hardware kill switch.
T 1702316271 18<27MacGyver18>	Exa: Soft blocked usually works fine.

T 1702318161 18<27MacGyver18>	I was thinking "drive firmware crash could've survived SATA cable unplug".
T 1702318189 18<20fenugrec18>	(or a buggy SSD firmware, which may maintain some state through a data cable re-seat)
T 1702318211 18<20fenugrec18>	but yeah, this is all conjecture. Piece of garbage works for now, hopefully lasts another 4-5 years
T 1702318243 18<22rapha18>	Pikk3wyn: no idea what a mux is. i disabled optimus in order to get the sound card working, and i do have sound output now ... still no working microphone though. the reason i was asking about the "None" display is that, once i plug in the HDMI screen and close the lid, it does switch off the internal, but now the desktop becomes a double-width virtual desktop, which is annoying.
T 1702318281 18<29Pikk3wyn18>	rapha: closing the laptop wouldnt turn off the screen in xrandr
T 1702318291 18<29Pikk3wyn18>	rapha: you can use xrandr --off eDP-1

T 1702318345 18<22rapha18>	for some reason though, the desktop ends up being 5120x1440px

T 1708438134 18<29astralc18>	what wrong with that? it is new version, so pkgrel should be reset
T 1708438226 18<27FreeFull18>	Well, the maintainer changed the PKGBUILD (fixed an install path), incremented the pkgrel, but because the pkgver ended up being the same as the previously-installed package, and pkgrel got reset to 1, it didn't update my installed version
T 1708438252 18<27FreeFull18>	Ok, so the fix is to make the pkgver variable match what pkgver() outputs

T 1708442659 18<27Namarrgon18>	yes, since arch tends to ship vanilla software the information often applies to other distro that haven't meddled too much with the software

T 1708442885 18<20Juest18>	i see, is that why the wiki does not provide further detailed instructions on the installation of it?
T 1708442931 18<20port1918>	I suggest you look into Artix, an Arch Linux derivative offering a selection of non-systemd init systems, but otherwise staying close to upstream

T 1708443068 18<29Foxboron18>	They pull all service files from other distros, like Void, Gentoo and Alpine.
T 1708443072 18<20port1918>	As far as I can tell they patch existing arch packages that provide systemd services
T 1708443084 18<20Juest18>	correct
T 1708443092 18<29Foxboron18>	It's a frankenstein distro, they pull PKGBUILDs from Arch and then add service files from another distro and serve this to users
T 1708443096 18<20Juest18>	is that not considered supported?
T 1708443096 18<29Foxboron18>	Go use something proper

T 1708443110 18<20port1918>	Exactly, there is little actual work going on besides building ISOs and maintaining a website
T 1708443139 18<20port1918>	I second the suggestion of Foxboron to just use sth proper instead, should you be at all open to that idea 
T 1708443157 18<20Juest18>	at least its convenient to users who want the benefits of arch while using a different initd
T 1708443170 18<29Foxboron18>	You get none of the benefits. It's not Arch

T 1708443225 18<20port1918>	There is far worse in terms of arch derivatives
T 1708443237 18<29Foxboron18>	Then go have fun and rely on their non-existing support when you need it

T 1708538636 18<24predicament18>	and symlinks are all over the place
T 1708538642 18<28Vorpal18>	predicament: so: in PKGBUILDs you can mark certain files as backup. This is what makes pacman save a .pacnew file when upgrading and you change the config file. I'm asking, can it also be applied to symlinks or just regular files? As pacman(8) talks about comparing md5sums I don't see how it could work.
T 1708538665 18<28Vorpal18>	maybe it would hash the target path of the symlink?

T 1708538826 18<28Vorpal18>	"HANDLING CONFIG FILES" in pacman(8) is no help. Because it talks about md5sums. What does that mean for symlinks?
