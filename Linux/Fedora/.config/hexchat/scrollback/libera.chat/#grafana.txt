T 1710151970 18<20hmht18>	MrTrick: I don't have a perfect solution yet, but maybe: You have the count_over_time(... [1d]) time, and there's a "step" time in the query options. Setting the "step" to 1d might be more like what you want, you'll probably want to put the count_over_time back to [$__auto] when you switch to that.
T 1710152221 18<20hmht18>	The buckets will be aligned to your dashboard's range instead of midnight. Haven't figured out how to do that yet.

T 1710152357 18<20hmht18>	the [] denotes the window, as you figured out already, so it's not what you want here.
