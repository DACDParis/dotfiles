T 1708514036 18<27akrawt118>	well I got this old audiofire audio interface, which seems has too old firmware version to run on modern hw/sw
T 1708514089 18<27akrawt118>	it seems in order to update it to the next firmware version , from where I will have more options for updating it to the newest available  I need some old set of hw with firewire port and win xp or like macos tiger or something
T 1708514113 18<27akrawt118>	not even sure which macos it would need in that case. was gonna look for the used market, for some ancient mac mini or smth :)
T 1708514182 18<28href18>	maybe use a vm? afaik you can run old macoses this way
T 1708514448 18<27akrawt118>	well yeah I was askig about it early. after brief googling it seemed like a task with little chances for success

T 1708514664 18<27akrawt118>	so should be able to grab one quick enough when it gets clear which os/hw has more chances to success in this task
T 1708514791 18<28href18>	parallels and vmware can do that iirc. and they should support doing the passthrough of the interface
T 1708514816 18<28href18>	anyway even on older macos getting an audiofire to run isn't a fun task, struggled about that like 4-5 years ago

T 1708516058 18<27akrawt118>	well yeah, if your device firmware is something higher then the very first one
T 1708516063 18<27akrawt118>	at least what it seems like to me
T 1708516077 18<27akrawt118>	because Im usccessfuly using same model line device since like 2006

T 1708517439 18<25Brains18>	That AudioFire is PowerPC-era stuff, so unless you're prepared to use an older Mac with an older OS X, you'd be better off selling it to a Windows user, as there's some hobbyist-level support.
T 1708517531 18<25Brains18>	Depending on which AudioFire it is - say, its a 12 & not a 4, you should be able to use it with Mavericks (10.9.5) and no higher. Snowkitty on a suitable Mac would be the sweet spot for the whole line.
