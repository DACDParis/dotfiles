T 1702314605 18<29akrumov18>	Has anyone else encountered the following issue? I've built Ansible from the devel branch, and when I try to execute a playbook, I receive the following error: ansible_ansible.builtin.file_payload.zip/ansible/module_utils/basic.py, line 5, SyntaxError: future feature annotations is not defined. From what I've seen, there is a pull request (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81902) that make changes to this. I'm using Python version 3.11.4 with Ansible
T 1702314605 18<29akrumov18>	[core 2.17.0.dev0] (devel a9919dd7f6).
T 1702315120 18<20jms118>	question: is there a way to have a message printed (like `ansible.builtin.debug`) at the very end of a playbook run? we're going to have playbooks which invoke several dozen different roles, which will potentially generate a couple thousand screenfuls of output, and i need a "you need to reboot the machine" message to print at the very end of the output so the user doesn't miss it
T 1702315211 18<29akrumov18>	Did you try to use post_tasks ?
T 1702315460 18<19oblikoamorale18>	akrumov: works for me. doublecheck your python version (anything 3.7+ should work) https://dpaste.org/yv3u9
T 1702315737 18<20jms118>	i didn't try, because i didn't know such a thing existed. reading about it now.
T 1702315924 18<20jms118>	okay, so pre_tasks and post_tasks can be declared in a playbook. is there a way for a ROLE to declare tasks that need to be done at the end of the playbook which called it?
T 1702315946 18<29akrumov18>	oblikoamorale I just tested it on 2 different machines with this python version with same results. Did you run only this command or build the ansible and run playbook or task ?
T 1702315996 18<19oblikoamorale18>	what is your python version on target host?
T 1702316065 18<19oblikoamorale18>	apparently 2.17 will require at least python 3.7
T 1702316108 18<29akrumov18>	python3.10
T 1702316206 18<19oblikoamorale18>	and if you try to make that import on py3.10 as I showed, will it fail?

T 1702316276 18<19oblikoamorale18>	huh. works for me on py 3.10.12.  and no, I didn't build ansible. just testing the error you have indicated
T 1702316334 18<19oblikoamorale18>	is it possible you have more than one py3 version on target host and interpreter discovery somehow chooses wrong one?
T 1702316405 18<29akrumov18>	I was thinking the same so I set the interpretter in the inventory:
T 1702316521 18<29akrumov18>	jms1 I don think this is possible. I just don get it why post_tasks doesn't´t work for you ?
T 1702316662 18<19oblikoamorale18>	does it fail if you run 'ansible -m file -a "path=/tmp/test state=touch" localhost' ? on the host with py 3.11
T 1702316704 18<29akrumov18>	This is working
T 1702316794 18<19oblikoamorale18>	then doublecheck your python interpreter assumptions.   ansible -m setup -a "filter=ansible_python" target_host
T 1702316958 18<20jms118>	akrumov: i don't know either. again, i didn't know "post_tasks" existed until ten minutes ago. i haven't had time to try it. is there a way for code within the roles to dynamically add messages to an array, and then a "post_tasks" item could just print the array?
T 1702317147 18<29akrumov18>	Yes, you need to use set_fact. set_fact:
T 1702317147 18<29akrumov18>	 messages: "{{ messages + ['Your message here'] }}"
T 1702317253 18<20jms118>	so `messages` is like a "global variable" ... over time would that build `['a','b','c']` or `['a',['b',['c']]]` ?
T 1702317304 18<29akrumov18>	jms1 ['a','b','c']

T 1702317546 18<24sahil_18>	Hi. I was learning ansible, and was tinkering with it. 3 arch VMs and 1 debian VM. This is the playbook https://termbin.com/d7j7 .  And I got this https://termbin.com/nm9r . It says ok=8 for debian one 192.168.122.19, rest it says 1 ok. is that 8 because of 2 gather facts and 6 plays, or what. And what's that ok=1 for the other 3 VMs
T 1702317556 18<29akrumov18>	Here is the output: https://dpaste.org/jVMKv
T 1702317579 18<19oblikoamorale18>	jms1: I've been there. and honestly the idea for human to track playbook execution results is rather silly. if you still think you have to do this, look at handlers. they are run on play end
T 1702317614 18<19oblikoamorale18>	akrumov: I'm out of ideas
T 1702317615 18<24sahil_18>	And why didn't it try to run on the arch VMs again. After the first package install failure, it didn't even try.
T 1702317728 18<20jms118>	oblikomorale: is there an alternative, i.e. some way for a human to *reliably* be told that a change that ansible made, requires that they take a specific action? i.e. reboot to enable/disable selinux, restart a service that *cannot* be restarted outside of a maintenance window, that kinda thing
T 1702318073 18<19oblikoamorale18>	handlers. make handlers to do a debug: msg: whatever message you need.  notify handler on needed task(s).  as a free bonus messages will be host specific without the need of additional processing that set_fact method will require

T 1702321004 18<20jms118>	the current puppet code base is handling everything from centos 5 forward ... ansible is going to be RHEL 9 and later, so i'm pushing to make selinux non-configurable, or at least only enforcing/permissive but never disabled ... until that happens i still have to be able to handle going to/from disabled (and after that i'll still need to handle "from" disabled, in which case a reboot is still needed)
T 1702321085 18<20jms118>	plus there are some other changes that normally require service restarts, but we're not allowed to restart certain services outside of a maintenance window, so instead we just print a message saying "service xyz needs to be restarted" so the production guys are at least *aware* of it

T 1708525263 18<25StyXman18>	Gekk: you will need to show a little bit more of that code, and "doesn't help" is not very much descriptive of the outcome you're actully getting

T 1708528228 18<19oblikoamorale18>	tags can be applied to tasks either statically or dynamically. but the only way to choose what tags to run is --tags argument of ansible-playbook

T 1708535815 18<24mathstuf18>	hi, is there a reason why `ansible-playbook --check` seems to be trying to actually perform actions?
T 1708536431 18<24mathstuf18>	the first failing action i have is https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/lineinfile_module.html
T 1708536448 18<24mathstuf18>	the file doesnt exist because the package isnt installed (which seems fine given that we're in `--check`)?
T 1708536505 18<24bkhl18>	And the lineinfile task has 'create: true'?
T 1708536902 18<24mathstuf18>	nope
T 1708536941 18<24mathstuf18>	ok, that looks relevant
T 1708539041 18<19flowerysong18>	Modules that support check mode will generally still fail in cases where it can't possibly perform the action (in this case because the file doesn't exist.) To skip the task entirely in check mode. you have to add a condition.
T 1708539060 18<19flowerysong18>	https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_checkmode.html#skipping-tasks-or-ignoring-errors-in-check-mode
T 1708539099 18<19flowerysong18>	(Adding `create: true` probably isn't a good fix for this particular task, because you normally want it to fail if the file doesn't exist.)
T 1708541014 18<22SuperLag18>	If you're using the Ansible provider for Terraform, does that assume the Ansible binaries are already on the box?
T 1708541226 18<19flowerysong18>	That's really a Terraform question, but the answer's probably 'yes.'
T 1708541301 18<19flowerysong18>	Just like if you were using `community.general.terraform` it needs Terraform to already be installed wherever the module is run.

T 1709073696 18<29awb18>	Looking for some help with run_once and role handlers. I have a role that writes a file on the controller and I do this with a handler. I do a flush_handlers right after notify from another role's tasks. What I see now is that the first target in a group stops processing the rest of the tasks until every other target is done. Any idea what might be going on there?
T 1709074179 18<25nerdette18>	did you set -vvv and have a look?
T 1709074227 18<25nerdette18>	I remember there was also an option to save the generated python scripts on the target
T 1709074245 18<29awb18>	Yes and it wasn't super helpful. I just reduced my plays to a simple test case and will run it again real quick...
T 1709074246 18<19flowerysong18>	Sounds like a bug. What version of ansible-core are you using? (Also, because it needs to be ruled out: are you using Mitogen?)
T 1709074378 18<29awb18>	2.16.3 and I don't know what Mitogen is :D
T 1709075266 18<19flowerysong18>	I can't reproduce your result with the information you've provided, so the issue probably lies somewhere in the details that you haven't provided.
T 1709075833 18<29awb18>	I think I might have found something. I am looking at the -vvv output and following along the handler's tasks, it suddenly jumps back to the invoking task list. Let me see if I can describe it...
T 1709076078 18<29awb18>	I see all these RUNNING HANDLER lines and they are all correct. It gets to a waitfor, which it correctly skips. The next task is a pause, which should also be skipped but instead it executes the next task after I did the handler flush. Meaning, it "jumps back" to the calling role. I see a TASK with the /wrong/ task description (the previous one from the handler) but the correct filename and execution.
T 1709076103 18<29awb18>	Could this be caused by using a pause with a prompt in a handler?
T 1709076194 18<29awb18>	It also only executes that next task for targets that are not the first one, the one it correctly used for the run_once.
T 1709076393 18<29awb18>	I should probably also add that this all worked just fine previously when it was not a role, but import_tasks. To answer the obvious question of "what changed?" :D
T 1709076502 18<25nerdette18>	btw., I believe I found my issue: old syntax. Correct I believe is:  loop: "{{ (files.files | sort(attribute='mtime'))[:-2] }}" ... testing it
T 1709077191 18<25nerdette18>	... just removed a few thousand backup files, looks good :-)
T 1709077252 18<29awb18>	Nice job, nerdette!
T 1709077333 18<29awb18>	OK, so my problem is getting a bit more weird. The task in the handler that is mislabeled (i.e., it "jumps back") is always the fourth one. The target group is five hosts, four of which show up in that task.
T 1709077364 18<29awb18>	I am going to change it all to debug tasks to eliminate any conditionals interfering.

T 1709083249 18<29awb18>	I use that pretty commonly and it's a good idea. I just think it is more hassle that it is worth in this case. I just move the handler code into tasks/main.yml and do an import_role instead. Works.

T 1709205853 18<24Shadur18>	(BEcause it turns out that if you have a cluster running with corosync, and you install and configure keepalived on one of its nodes, and keepalived is restarted, they get into an argument about who is in charge of things and Bad Stuff Happens. Given that stuff you install corosync or keepalived on tends to have HA requirements, this is not something you want to see in a production environment)

T 1709473899 18<19ljkimz18>	Is it expected that using `required_if` in a custom module argument spec makes the parameters that are tested implicitly required? I have a simple module with a parameter `enabled` which is not required for all uses of the module. However, we do want to specify that a few other parameters are required WHEN `enabled` is used.

T 1709629987 18<27colo18>	Haxxa: I see :) well, I would write a shellscript for the target device that sets the modem up in the expected way once, then use an inventory of all remote hosts and a task using that script via the ansible `script` module to mass-deploy/execute it. job done.
T 1709630003 18<27colo18>	(the script would use minicom, if you have that on each remote host)
T 1709630097 18<22Haxxa18>	So I have been using minicom interactively thus far. How do I use minicom with a script and make it wait for AT: OK for example, where commands can take 10 seconds to reply
T 1709630212 18<27colo18>	you can try automating minicom (using expect, for example), or use another tool for serial comms that is more friendly towards non-interactive use. maybe check out https://linux.die.net/man/1/runscript first.
