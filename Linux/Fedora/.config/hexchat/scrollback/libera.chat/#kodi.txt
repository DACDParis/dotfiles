T 1709629547 18<27Guest4718>	Hello guys, I installed kodi however after installing it I get "Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue, has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which means that Firefox can only connect to it securely." On several websites.
T 1709629548 18<27Guest4718>	Is this supposed to happen if not, how do I fix it?
T 1709629752 18<26Nei18>	either you got a virus infected kodi or it is unrelated to kodi
T 1709629818 18<26Nei18>	make sure you get kodi from https://kodi.tv and be careful with piraccy addons 
T 1709629909 18<27Guest4718>	I did download from that link and it happened before installing add-ons.
T 1709629909 18<27Guest4718>	To check out if kodi caused it, I also installed it on my phone and there the same issue occurs. After deleting the application from my phone it stopped giving these connection errors.
T 1709629910 18<27Guest4718>	I uninstalled kodi from my windows laptop but it still occurs
T 1709629934 18<26Nei18>	then it is unlikely that this is related to kodi
T 1709630028 18<26Nei18>	if you had these issues with your phone while on the same internet line as your PC, try using another internet connection and see if it makes a difference
T 1709630091 18<27Guest4718>	I might have found something. When I disconnect my laptop from wifi and use my phone hotspot the sites work
T 1709630091 18<27Guest4718>	However the same sites worked when I did not have kodi installed and was on the wifi. So it might be a combination of kodi and the wifi network
T 1709630126 18<26Nei18>	you could try restarting your wifi
T 1709630289 18<27Guest1118>	It is not my own wifi network but, still strange that it only started occurring after installing kodi.
T 1709630289 18<27Guest1118>	ANyway I will wait with it until I am at home on my own network again (currently at a hotel).
T 1709630290 18<27Guest1118>	Thank you for the help Nei
T 1709630350 18<26Nei18>	don't trust hotel network ;-)
T 1709630368 18<27DjSlash18>	it's quite possible that the hotel network has done something 
T 1709630411 18<27Guest1118>	Have a nice day
T 1709630413 18<27DjSlash18>	that firefox can't reach sites over https is not something that kodi has any influence on
T 1709630472 18<27Guest1118>	 the same site worked yesterday during the day. When I did not have kodi installed. ANd since from my side kodi was the only thing that changed I wanted to check if it was a possibility. But the hotel might have changed something on their side
T 1709631140 18<28deebo18>	you visited a site that used HSTS previously, and then on hotel wifi they tried to tamper with the connection and firefox reported that
T 1709631161 18<28deebo18>	possible trying to present their login portal as the site you requested

T 1710100164 18<24Guest8018>	Hi, I've just started with Kodi.. I'm having a problem playing DVDs. Whenever I set DVDs to autoplay, the disc will run as expected and the expected title menu appears as it would with a store bought DVD player, however.. after this happens a popup appears in the way of this, asking me to browse the DVD. Is there some way I can disable that
T 1710100164 18<24Guest8018>	behaviour and just auto play the DVD?
T 1710100926 18<26Nei18>	is the popup menu coming from Windows?
T 1710101110 18<24Guest8018>	No, it's a kodi style popup.. the OS is libreelec
T 1710101198 18<26Nei18>	ok idk maybe someone else can help you
T 1710101321 18<24Guest8018>	Sure, thanks anyway. I'll try it with a OS to see what happens, I was just hoping it was a simple config fix.
T 1710101331 18<24Guest8018>	with a live OS*
T 1710103763 18<24Guest8018>	Okay, so trying it with a live devuan USB stick.. I found I can play without that annoying popup. The problem was solved by installing and configuring libdvd-pkg.. I could then start with a fresh kodi config and both kodi and kodi-standalone were working fine. I guess then they don't have the normal debian libdvdcss setup in libreelec, or it needs

T 1710103830 18<24Guest8018>	probably the latter, maybe due to distribution restrictions on dvd libs
