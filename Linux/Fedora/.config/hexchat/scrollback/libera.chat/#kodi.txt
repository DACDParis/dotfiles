T 1709629547 18<27Guest4718>	Hello guys, I installed kodi however after installing it I get "Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue, has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which means that Firefox can only connect to it securely." On several websites.
T 1709629548 18<27Guest4718>	Is this supposed to happen if not, how do I fix it?
T 1709629752 18<26Nei18>	either you got a virus infected kodi or it is unrelated to kodi
T 1709629818 18<26Nei18>	make sure you get kodi from https://kodi.tv and be careful with piraccy addons 
T 1709629909 18<27Guest4718>	I did download from that link and it happened before installing add-ons.
T 1709629909 18<27Guest4718>	To check out if kodi caused it, I also installed it on my phone and there the same issue occurs. After deleting the application from my phone it stopped giving these connection errors.
T 1709629910 18<27Guest4718>	I uninstalled kodi from my windows laptop but it still occurs
T 1709629934 18<26Nei18>	then it is unlikely that this is related to kodi
T 1709630028 18<26Nei18>	if you had these issues with your phone while on the same internet line as your PC, try using another internet connection and see if it makes a difference
T 1709630091 18<27Guest4718>	I might have found something. When I disconnect my laptop from wifi and use my phone hotspot the sites work
T 1709630091 18<27Guest4718>	However the same sites worked when I did not have kodi installed and was on the wifi. So it might be a combination of kodi and the wifi network
T 1709630126 18<26Nei18>	you could try restarting your wifi
T 1709630289 18<27Guest1118>	It is not my own wifi network but, still strange that it only started occurring after installing kodi.
T 1709630289 18<27Guest1118>	ANyway I will wait with it until I am at home on my own network again (currently at a hotel).
T 1709630290 18<27Guest1118>	Thank you for the help Nei
T 1709630350 18<26Nei18>	don't trust hotel network ;-)
T 1709630368 18<27DjSlash18>	it's quite possible that the hotel network has done something 
T 1709630411 18<27Guest1118>	Have a nice day
T 1709630413 18<27DjSlash18>	that firefox can't reach sites over https is not something that kodi has any influence on
T 1709630472 18<27Guest1118>	 the same site worked yesterday during the day. When I did not have kodi installed. ANd since from my side kodi was the only thing that changed I wanted to check if it was a possibility. But the hotel might have changed something on their side
T 1709631140 18<28deebo18>	you visited a site that used HSTS previously, and then on hotel wifi they tried to tamper with the connection and firefox reported that
T 1709631161 18<28deebo18>	possible trying to present their login portal as the site you requested

Is there some way I can disable that

The problem was solved by installing and configuring libdvd-pkg.. I could then start with a fresh kodi config and both kodi and kodi-standalone were working fine. I guess then they don't have the normal debian libdvdcss setup in libreelec, or it needs

T 1710506013 18<25TuxJobs218>	One thing that I do find annoying is that the volume is extremely low on these TV episodes, which they shouldn't be because I've viewed them on the computer as well, but they are in Kodi, and thus I have to press a button on the controller (I use a cheap old USB gamepad to control Kodi) and then increase the dB of loudness compensation (or something like that), but that value seems to reset each time you view it, or perhaps per-file.

It expands on existing surround sound systems by adding height channels, allowing sounds to be interpreted as three-dimensional objects with neither horizontal nor vertical limitations." <-- Sounds fancy.
