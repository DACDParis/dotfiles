T 1708633734 18<27JanC18>	sney: I think this is related to that Russian HexChat fork (they renamed it to RubIRC or something like that, but apparently forgot to change the default/support channel name)
T 1708633847 18<27sney18>	yeah, that default being compiled in was a big problem for oftc #debian for years too 
T 1708633869 18<27JanC18>	oh?
T 1708633921 18<27sney18>	xchat on ubuntu pointed to there, and then when I fixed it with the first hexchat upload, every non-ubuntu debian derivative pointed there as well 
T 1708633948 18<27incog18>	just make the default efnet we'll play with them
T 1708634031 18<25korn3r18>	i wonder what exactly that RubIRC has different from the original Hexchat :)
T 1708634068 18<27sney18>	probably just default dark mode or something 
T 1708634136 18<27JanC18>	based on the screenshot it seems like they changed the default server list
T 1708634150 18<27sney18>	impressive that they still connect here, then 
T 1708634189 18<27JanC18>	also, the source is available as a .tar.xz
T 1708634202 18<27incog18>	it looks like this http://global.net.ru/rubirc/win/win-1.png
T 1708634219 18<27incog18>	so just like hexchat
T 1708634229 18<27sney18>	I don't read cyrillic but what I can see doesn't look any different 
T 1708634287 18<27incog18>	i would die to see an irc client specifically made for the art scene, we like to pump ascii scrolls on efnet
T 1708634301 18<27incog18>	and well, hexchat cant pump, no nice /play function
T 1708634314 18<27incog18>	so you gotta grab irssi or pirate mirc
T 1708634316 18<27JanC18>	the server list seems to have names like "International" & "Portuguese" & such instead of the networks
T 1708634373 18<27sney18>	incog: have you checked for a script with a different name that does a similar job as /play ? someone in here mentioned something like that a few days ago 
T 1708634395 18<27incog18>	https://mircart.org/ you all missing out, thinkin its just spam
T 1708634403 18<27JanC18>	I remember something like that, but don't remember the details
T 1708634439 18<27JanC18>	probably saw it when looking through someone's hexchat scripts repo  :)
T 1708634447 18<27JanC18>	or maybe xchat even
T 1708634479 18<27sney18>	incog: I don't know where you get the idea that people in this channel are "against" something just because hexchat doesn't have this function built in
T 1708634494 18<27sney18>	nobody here made that decision, and hexchat is popular because it supports loads of addons. do the math.
T 1708634517 18<27incog18>	nah libera is just like freenode in that respect, ascii art is seen as spam
T 1708634529 18<27JanC18>	it depends on the channel
T 1708634539 18<27sney18>	?? nobody in this channel makes those decisions for libera either 
T 1708634555 18<27sney18>	I'm on a private network that used to have weekly flood fridays lol
T 1708634555 18<27incog18>	im talking as a culture sney not individuals
T 1708634565 18<27JanC18>	if you want to start ##incogsasciiart please do  :)
T 1708634655 18<27JanC18>	there already also are channels where it is *encouraged* to spam what music you are listening to for example, even if most other channels don't like that
T 1708635023 18<27JanC18>	hm, seems like it shouldn't auto-join this channel...
T 1708635118 18<27sney18>	it probably has the joind.c default that suggests it when you connect to libera 
T 1708635125 18<27JanC18>	it auto-joins #rubirc now
T 1708635137 18<27sney18>	there's no "auto join" but it only requires pressing enter on a dialog without reading it 
T 1708635138 18<27JanC18>	but maybe an earlier version didn't
T 1708635155 18<27sney18>	https://github.com/hexchat/hexchat/blob/master/src/fe-gtk/joind.c#L250
T 1708635200 18<27JanC18>	it says « gtk_entry_set_text (GTK_ENTRY (entry1), "#rubirc"); » now
T 1708635258 18<27sney18>	well, hopefully that change proliferates 
T 1708635414 18<25korn3r18>	JanC: looks like some student project. also guy release 2.16.3 version on 1st january.

T 1708635476 18<27JanC18>	don't trust the times in the archive
T 1708635555 18<25korn3r18>	JanC: VK.com page of this thing has rubirc-2.16.3-1-rosa2021.1.x86_64.rpm posted a 1th of january )
T 1708635597 18<25korn3r18>	2.16.3-2 on 8th january and so on.. probably he just added +2 to original build
T 1708635604 18<27JanC18>	so do the internal date/time inside the archive, but Apache directories say differently  :)
T 1708635614 18<27JanC18>	oh
T 1708635695 18<27JanC18>	right, first influx of Russians with RubIRC was on January 1st indeed
T 1708635776 18<25korn3r18>	well.. there is not much russians, that VK.com community have only one member (developer). and almost no other mentiones over the internet
T 1708635824 18<27JanC18>	probably school friends  :)

T 1708641264 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	And /play is a 4 line script.
T 1708641312 18<27JanC18>	a bit more than that I'm sure
T 1708641370 18<27JanC18>	you don't want to block everything while posting 1 line per second from a 50-line file   :)
T 1708641643 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	/play has a delay? I thought it just dumps a text file into the channel. Until you are disconnected for MaxQ exceeded.
T 1708641677 18<27sney18>	aiui it is a bit more involved than just /exec -o cat homeanusbleach.txt 
T 1708641710 18<27sney18>	yeah, this has a whole bunch of switches and options https://www.mirc.com/help/html/index.html?playing_files.html
T 1708641826 18<27JanC18>	I thought the example given a couple days ago involved a delay between lines?  I might be wrong though...
T 1708641845 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	"If you have flood protection turned on, /play sends all lines through the flood protection feature to prevent you from flooding yourself off the server."
T 1708641879 18<27JanC18>	"""This plays the file poem.txt to the current window, which must be a query or channel window, with a default delay of 1000 milliseconds, ie. 1 second. """
T 1708641903 18<27JanC18>	so 1sec is the default, it seems
T 1708641930 18<27JanC18>	maybe with flood protection on there is no such delay?
T 1708641962 18<27JanC18>	it's not exactly clear from that documentation  :)
T 1708642406 18<27sney18>	1sec between lines is a great way to get your art interrupted with a lot of (✂ﾟ∀ﾟ)✂ CUTTO
T 1708642656 18<27incog18>	<DasBrain^Hex> /play has a delay?
T 1708642661 18<27incog18>	it has a delay you can config
T 1708642673 18<27incog18>	to get around sill flood protection serverside

T 1708644408 18<27incog18>	as it should be
T 1708644463 18<27incog18>	right now i have a much weirder problem however, do you see these rainbow bands on my latest art? https://pastebin.com/raw/eYYYrT1K
T 1708644477 18<27incog18>	they shouldnt be there, its like bizarre bleed-thru
T 1708644489 18<27incog18>	i have no idea how to mitigate it
T 1708644509 18<25Tum18>	it's due to subpixel rendering 
T 1708644519 18<25Tum18>	or scaling 
T 1708644555 18<25Tum18>	you can use subpixels to render greyscale content resulting in sharper lines since each pixel is actually 3 pixels, one for each color 
T 1708644562 18<25Tum18>	depends on the software displaying it though
T 1708644571 18<27incog18>	irc clients
T 1708644613 18<25Tum18>	Depends on the platform then. macOS does not use subpixel rendering but Windows does, and most Linux distros do.
T 1708644647 18<25Tum18>	in all cases it can be disabled if need be but keep in mind most people will see it WITH subpixel rendering, since it's still default on Windows
T 1708644673 18<25Tum18>	If you screenshot some text on Windows and zoom into it, you will see red and blue on the edges of the text
T 1708644689 18<25Tum18>	when displayed at 1x you won't normally see the colors, it just looks like crisper text rendering
T 1708644734 18<25Tum18>	HexChat uses GTK so it depends how your GTK is configured also
T 1708645036 18<27JanC18>	just don't use subpixel rendering, it's broken by design
T 1708645103 18<27JanC18>	I've never used that because when it's enabled I see colour fringes on all text, which gives me a headache...
T 1708645273 18<27JanC18>	Tum: unfortunately some people (like me) *do* see those colour fringes

T 1709258098 18<26pabs318>	warsoul: hmm, changing the colours works fine for me. does it work if you restart hexchat?
T 1709258339 18<28warsoul18>	pabs3 no i have done everything
T 1709258345 18<28warsoul18>	will still keep this colors

T 1709258542 18<26pabs318>	and which version of hexchat are you using? from FreeBSD or self-built?

T 1709258862 18<28warsoul18>	it should be change once i change it in preferences
T 1709259323 18<26pabs318>	definitely weird
T 1709259373 18<26pabs318>	maybe try in a Linux live image on the same machine to start with, confirm that it works somewhere for you at least
T 1709259446 18<27JanC18>	you have to look up in Text Events what colours are used for that particular type of text
T 1709259466 18<27JanC18>	or just use (or at least start from) an existing theme
T 1709259521 18<27JanC18>	like I explained 5 days ago...
T 1709259791 18<28warsoul18>	JanC i have change this colors before in another OS like debian etc...

T 1709260259 18<26pabs318>	it works for me in prefs without changing the text events
T 1709260603 18<28warsoul18>	JanC can you explain again how to load the theme please?
T 1709260666 18<27JanC18>	pabs3: but in the Text Events you can see what colour is used, and thus which one to replace
T 1709260797 18<26pabs318>	hmm, ok
T 1709260865 18<27JanC18>	warsoul: https://hexchat.github.io/themes.html & https://hexchat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appearance.html#theme-files
T 1709260998 18<27JanC18>	e.g. the example I gave last time, for me the "Your Message" template is "%C20%H<%H$4$1%H>%H%O%C30$t$2%O"
T 1709261029 18<27JanC18>	there colour #20 is used for my nick, and colour #30 for the rest of the line
T 1709261039 18<28warsoul18>	theme worked
T 1709261142 18<28warsoul18>	thanks JanC
T 1709261174 18<27JanC18>	BTW: if you have a HexChat configuration that works well on any of your computers, you can just copy it over to another one, and it will work the same there...
T 1709261189 18<28warsoul18>	i thought about that

T 1709262124 18<26pabs318>	hmm, '/doat #foo say bar' does not add to the up-arrow message history
T 1709262619 18<27JanC18>	it adds the whole line to where you entered it I presume
T 1709262652 18<26pabs318>	yep
T 1709262656 18<27JanC18>	but not '/say bar' to #foo?
T 1709262663 18<27JanC18>	probably for the best?
T 1709262666 18<26pabs318>	right
T 1709262707 18*	26pabs3 not sure
T 1709262721 18*	26pabs3 kind of thinking having both would be best
T 1709262819 18<27JanC18>	it could be used in a script or from a keyboard shortcut or as part of a /timer command, etc., and do you really want it added to your history in all of those cases?

T 1709316508 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	Well, I did update/rewrite the Tcl plugin. Mostly for personal use, but it is on Github: https://github.com/DasBrain/hexchat-addons/tree/master/c/tcl
T 1709316598 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	The good news: It works with 64-bit. Before, it would just crash on windows. (pointers were cast to int, which is 32-bit on win64)
T 1709316616 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	The bad news: It breaks all existing Tcl scripts.
T 1709316654 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	(Because the new API is closer to the plugin API.)
T 1709316767 18<27JanC18>	how bad is the breakage though?
T 1709316794 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	New API.
T 1709316878 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	I think I wrote some compat script, which provides the old API: https://github.com/DasBrain/hexchat-addons/blob/master/c/tcl/compat.tcl - but no idea how complete it is.
T 1709316883 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	I forgot.
T 1709316900 18<27JanC18>	that sounds like it would be useful
T 1709316921 18<27JanC18>	even when it's not complete, it would mean less changes are needed

T 1709366971 18<27Jaxx18>	I know. but remember,he has been doing this if im not wrong since 2009
T 1709367064 18<28gothkat18>	If you find a fork that is doing something better, by all means, go for it. But short of hiring someone, you’re not getting hourly builds here. 
T 1709367095 18<27Jaxx18>	i understand. i hope it continues,because its really good client
T 1709367129 18<25korn3r18>	why would you prefer frequently updated client over good client?
T 1709367781 18<27Jaxx18>	dont u think sooner or later any programme or even a irc client can get bad if its not getting updated. cuz u never know if it have bugs etc. and nobody will use a buggy client..
T 1709368353 18<28gothkat18>	When/if something better appears, I’ll switch. Whether anyone is actively planning on making changes makes zero difference to how it performs today and tomorrow. 
T 1709368564 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	Correct. The only thing this means for me now is: There will be no new features.
T 1709368652 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	And if some exploit/crash or other stuff is found, maybe someone will step up and fix it. Maybe I am the person who will fix it (mostly for myself, and then figure out how to distribute the fix - not looking forward to that)
T 1709368694 18<28DasBrain^Hex18>	But currently - I do not see a need to change anything for myself, so... why bother.
T 1709368727 18<27Jaxx18>	i just switched until further notice
T 1709368847 18<28gothkat18>	You do you Jaxx, but if HexChat was the best client for your needs last month, it still is today and still will be tomorrow too.

T 1710010263 18<24sorcier18>	i'm fairly new to programming, just trying to get this to work as hexchat doesn't have this functionality built it and there's nothing that I can use that has it(mIRC but that's Windows based)
T 1710010268 18<27JanC18>	and you use format strings elsewhere already, so I assume you know how to use them with command()
