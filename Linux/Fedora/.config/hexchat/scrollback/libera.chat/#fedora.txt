T 1708626444 18<19dowdle18>	Voidwarped: How Fedora has operated historically... whatever was the latest kernel at the time is what you get on a new release... and after the ~13 months of lifecycle, it goes EOL with the latest kernel what was available at that time.  Given that there are 4 different major kernel releases per year... and that it seems Fedora has a kernel update every few days... it's hard to imaging them maintaining builds for multiple kernels per release.
T 1708626678 18<26Khaytsus18>	I think Fedora would generally say if you need an LTS install, use RHEL.
