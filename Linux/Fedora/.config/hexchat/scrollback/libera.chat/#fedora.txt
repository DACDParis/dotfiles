T 1708626444 18<19dowdle18>	Voidwarped: How Fedora has operated historically... whatever was the latest kernel at the time is what you get on a new release... and after the ~13 months of lifecycle, it goes EOL with the latest kernel what was available at that time.  Given that there are 4 different major kernel releases per year... and that it seems Fedora has a kernel update every few days... it's hard to imaging them maintaining builds for multiple kernels per release.
T 1708626678 18<26Khaytsus18>	I think Fedora would generally say if you need an LTS install, use RHEL.

T 1709760406 18<28Exa18>	Hello, I'm considering installing Kinoite for my parent's new computer.  I've never used Fedora or any of its flavours, but I like the idea of immutable filesystems and using flatpak as main packaging distribution.  Is there anything I should know about it?  How is it easy for someone not good with computers to make updates on this distro?  I guess the flatpak part uses discover?  What about the operating 
T 1709760411 18<28Exa18>	system part?  For the record, their current computer has Xubuntu, but the transition from XFCE to KDE should be good.  Thanks.
T 1709760556 18<19dowdle18>	Exa: I haven't used the immutable (now they call it Atomic I think?) flavors myself... but hey... maybe try it in a VM or something to get some experience with it.  Only graphical apps are in flatpaks so if you want any command line stuff, you'll need to use toolbox and/or distrobox.
T 1709760557 18<26Khaytsus18>	Exa: It's pretty much made for such use cases.. it's nearly unbreakable.  And yes, KDE Discover will keep the system up to date.
T 1709760791 18<28Exa18>	dowdle: I already bought the new computer so I'll try first on real hardware myself anyway, but I wanted to get some thoughts cleared on irc first (I got the iso downloaded on my bt client already so I'm going to burn it on my usb key right now)
T 1709760812 18<28Exa18>	Khaytsus: thank you, this is what I expected
T 1709760884 18<28Exa18>	I'm just wondering how system updates work, since I would not be able to try it if I just install latest version.  is there any chance I could find a video, for example?  I'm expecting it to be different from vanilla fedora updates, but maybe it uses the same interface?  or maybe I could check for silverblue videos?
T 1709760933 18<19dowdle18>	Exa: You might could get a previous release and upgrade it to the current release?
T 1709760943 18<28Exa18>	yeah I could do that in a VM
T 1709760955 18<19dowdle18>	I wonder if they have an F40 pre-release to upgrade to from F39?
T 1709760992 18<19dowdle18>	Exa: I believe it uses rpm-ostree under the hood... which I believe is very similar to say... git... where it only has to replace changed files.
T 1709761044 18<28Exa18>	I'm downloading 38 too.  maybe I'll have to install it without a network interface, so I don't have updates during installation, if that exists??
T 1709761051 18<19dowdle18>	Exa: And it keeps the previous release so you can switch back to it if, for some reason you don't like the upgrade.  I don't think that happens so it's a solution looking for a problem :)
T 1709761075 18<28Exa18>	I guess the immutable part helps with that
T 1709761087 18<19dowdle18>	Exa: Not being package based, I don't think there is an option for updates-during-install... but I could be wrong.
T 1709761154 18<28Exa18>	if I like it, I could even try the sway flavour for myself :P
T 1709761165 18<19dowdle18>	Exa: And even with Fedora live media, there isn't an upgrade-during-install option... because those aren't package-based (for the install).

T 1710073028 18<20felsokning18>	Hello! I'm writing/developing an Octopus Deploy Worker Tool container for Fedora to be used by Octopus Deploy/Calamari during deployments. The only pertitent fact from this is this is all within a container context. Inside the container, I am pulling a particular tool, umoci, from github (releases haven't been published in like two years - but it's still actively developed) and using make to create it. This works locally by `docker build -t <tag> 
T 1710073028 18<20felsokning18>	.` AND via `docker-compose...`. I am building Alpine, Arch, Debian, and Fedora images (not related but showing this only affects Fedora).
T 1710073087 18<20felsokning18>	However, when I build these images git github actions using an ubuntu runner (to publish to docker hub), Fedora breaks because go is missing?

T 1710073168 18<20felsokning18>	No -- but they're not installed via local dockerfile, either; it's the same dockerfile.
T 1710073286 18<20felsokning18>	Dockerfile steps: && git clone https://github.com/opencontainers/umoci.git \ && cd umoci \ && make -si DESTDIR=/ install > /dev/null \ && cd / \ && rm -rf umoci
T 1710073569 18<25NthDegree18>	that suggests the Fedora image doesn't include golang and needs to be explicitly pulled in
T 1710073971 18<20felsokning18>	Does this mean that Build Kit is fudging things behind the scenes by including go references (internally) -- or masking them, like it does grep or the like?
