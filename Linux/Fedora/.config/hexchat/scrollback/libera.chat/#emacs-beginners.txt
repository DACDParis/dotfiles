T 1708789057 18<20corwin18>	heistema: assuming your config was working file but now isn't it's likely you are hitting some new bug with elgot.  The usual move in that case is to create a set of minimum steps to reproduce the error and then create a bug report, ideally from an Emacs -Q session where you run M-x report-emacs-bug RET right after reproducing the error.

T 1709707241 18<28piyush_2418>	Hello,
T 1709707314 18<28piyush_2418>	I am having trouble with my config and although lsp-mode is installed but it still doesn't open up in a C file (I have also configured lsp-clangd)
T 1709707371 18<28piyush_2418>	I am getting an error although with `counsel-projectile` package. Could that be hindering lsp-mode?
T 1709707646 18<20bpalmer18>	It's possible. What's the error?
T 1709707676 18<20bpalmer18>	and, what is your configuration that would run lsp ? Are you using eglot or lsp-ui?
T 1709707819 18<28piyush_2418>	the counsel-projectile error is simple: Error (use-package): Cannot load counsel-projectile
T 1709707949 18<28piyush_2418>	However, i just commented out the counsel-projectile section, there is still no lsp-mode
T 1709708037 18<28piyush_2418>	bpalmer: I am not using eglot, using `lsp-mode`
T 1709708198 18<20bpalmer18>	piyush_24: what happens if you do M-x lsp RET
T 1709708321 18<28piyush_2418>	bplamer: that gives me the option to import the project root and starts clangd once I import it.
T 1709708378 18<28piyush_2418>	However, this option lsp, in the M-x mini buffer was not available as long as I had the `use-package counsel-projectile` line in my config
T 1709708382 18<20bpalmer18>	piyush_24: so it sounds like you need to add a call to lsp to your major mode hook
T 1709708389 18<20bpalmer18>	something like (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'lsp)
T 1709708636 18<28piyush_2418>	I have this in my config:   :hook (((c-mode c++-mode objc-mode) . lsp-deferred)
T 1709708645 18<28piyush_2418>	I guess the deferred is causing the issue?
T 1709708774 18<20bpalmer18>	ah. I don't know lsp-deferred.
T 1709708787 18<20bpalmer18>	also make sure you're not using c-ts-mode (which uses treesitter)
T 1709708793 18<28piyush_2418>	Also counsel-projectile is a valid package. In fact its also avaialable in `M-x package-list-packages`, why would I get this error: Error (use-package): Cannot load counsel-projectile
T 1709708796 18<20bpalmer18>	C-h v major-mode RET 
T 1709708815 18<20bpalmer18>	piyush_24: I don't know. I'd suggest tackling one problem at a time, though.
T 1709708839 18<28piyush_2418>	I am using c-ts-mode, why is it not recommended?
T 1709708871 18<20bpalmer18>	it's fine, but c-ts-mode is not in that list you write, only c-mode
T 1709708875 18<20bpalmer18>	you can try adding it there
T 1709708942 18<28piyush_2418>	I have a separate list for c-ts-mode. 
T 1709708997 18<20bpalmer18>	so you add lsp-deferred to c-ts-mode-hook ?
T 1709709058 18<28piyush_2418>	I do
T 1709709081 18<28piyush_2418>	I just checked, apparently lsp-deferred is an optimization option, to not enable lsp until required
T 1709709192 18<20bpalmer18>	ok, and C-h v c-ts-mode-hook RET shows that it is there?
