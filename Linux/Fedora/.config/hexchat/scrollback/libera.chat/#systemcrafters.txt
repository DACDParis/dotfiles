T 1709725215 18<24sahil_18>	yes I found that when I searched treesit. Also doom actually seems better to get started with emacs, than custom config (I am using native-comp)

T 1709725265 18<20alternateved18>	Yeah, if you don't know much about Emacs then Doom can be a good starting point (at the same time it could make things harder)

T 1709725686 18<29trev18>	why would treesitter help? is the lag most likely from the major-mode?

T 1709753626 18<28morganw18>	SummerEmacs: For the question you posted on reddit about problems with autosave when org mode files have / in them, I would guess that you have some kind of hook which looks to update org process cookies.  So the problem would not be the autosave settings, but rather something that is automatically trying to update the files.

T 1710146043 18<26daviwil18>	I don't really see Guile as a language for the average VS Code user, but definitely the tooling should be equally good across "hacker" editors
T 1710146067 18<26daviwil18>	I don't mean that as a diss on VS Code users, more that the people who use VS Code are typically writing a different kind of app

T 1710146116 18<26daviwil18>	guile-ares-rs is definitely an attempt to make Guile more usable across all editors that have nREPL support

T 1710164221 18<19zororg18>	Kinda I came to conclusion that leveraging the plain org mode would be good. Many pointed out to use tags and headlines very much with notes. And after using packages like `consult` `org-ql`, I can feel that there is no need for zettel system for org mode users.

T 1710167856 18<20alternateved18>	I mostly track changes by git diffs

T 1710167957 18<28glenneth18>	so you run git for every change?

T 1710168256 18<28glenneth18>	the script I am woking on works, but only when the paths are hard coded.  daviwil helped me out, i commented out my working section, and incorporated those changes.  I'm still getting errors but different ones.  Think it has more to do with my command line arguments now
T 1710168274 18<26daviwil18>	glenneth: What I do is commit the current state of my code when I'm happy with it, then I run `git diff` after making changes to check out what I've done since the last commit
T 1710168291 18<26daviwil18>	I do that with `magit-status` to make things easier to navigate inside of Emacs

T 1710168604 18<19benoitj18>	I think it's somewhat related to the perception that developers write a lot of code in a day. nope.
T 1710168611 18<28glenneth18>	the script isn't correctly parsing the --target option even though it's clearly provided in the command line

T 1710168859 18<19benoitj18>	daviwil: that course uses geiser I guess

T 1710168951 18<19benoitj18>	daviwil: did you try Andrew's nrepl for geiser/emacs?
T 1710168969 18<26daviwil18>	glenneth: I actually discovered it by running into the same problem when I experimented with your snippet, I saw that --target value wasn't showing up in the result list and my guess was that since --target was the first parameter being passed in, it was somehow being skipped.  turns out I was right!
T 1710168986 18<26daviwil18>	benoitj: we took at look at it on stream a few months back, it works to a basic level but not for enough along yet

T 1710174502 18<29Fade18>	by POSIX, tilde is a shell alias for $HOME
T 1710174516 18<28morganw18>	That looks like a file named ~
T 1710174547 18<28morganw18>	try: ls -al '~'
T 1710174587 18<29Fade18>	I misread what you were saying
T 1710174606 18<20naokotani18>	ok weird
T 1710174607 18<29Fade18>	if you do 'ls -il' you will be able to find the inode of the file
T 1710174617 18<20naokotani18>	I did that and foudn it had a .config in it
T 1710174623 18<20naokotani18>	with nothing but weechat config
T 1710174631 18<29Fade18>	then do 'find . -inum <inode-number> -exec rm -i {} \;'
T 1710174632 18<20naokotani18>	I had sort of thought it was related to weechat but wasnt sure how
T 1710174660 18<28morganw18>	You should just be able to delete it normally as long as the shell doesn't expand it
T 1710174667 18<29Fade18>	it's almost certainly a bug in the file handling logic of weechat.
T 1710174685 18<20naokotani18>	morganw: thats is what worries me...
T 1710174691 18<29Fade18>	at least in Bash, you're going to need to go through the inode.
T 1710174695 18<26Marvin218>	at least from the trigger list, it uses Strings and inlcudes the table schema, but that's why you are probably vastly overcome by the lifetimes since you'll try to blame a line of pyhton in over 5 years
T 1710174695 18<20naokotani18>	i Iguess I could empty it and use rmdir to me sure
T 1710174774 18<29Fade18>	you can also refer to the file as ~/~ because the shell will only expand the first tilde.
T 1710174804 18<20naokotani18>	oh
T 1710174813 18<20naokotani18>	dired used it's super power to delete it

T 1710174826 18<28morganw18>	As long as it is quoted I wouldn't have thought you would need to do anything special to delete it.  It just needs to not expand.
T 1710174828 18<26Marvin218>	As long as it runs everywhere easily.
T 1710174850 18<20naokotani18>	I tried it in quotes with rmdir and it said its not empty
T 1710174861 18<29Fade18>	I'm reaching into the ancient archives of my memory, but I recall having a problem with this in the past that required I use the inode.
T 1710174864 18<26Marvin218>	I'm reaching into the ancient archives of my primary keys to be read some brain expert talking about
T 1710174903 18<28morganw18>	If it isn't empty then I don't think that is related to how to reference it, unless you are accidentally expanding it.
T 1710174932 18<20naokotani18>	well its gone and I ain't brining it back lol
T 1710174932 18<29Fade18>	that's true
T 1710174957 18<20naokotani18>	i definitely wasn't going to mess with rm -r '~'
T 1710174966 18<29Fade18>	you either went to some pains to create the file to begin with, or there's a file handler in your running software with a bug in it.
T 1710175006 18<20naokotani18>	Since it only had a .config and that only had weechat directory im going to go on a limb and assume wechat did it
T 1710175025 18<29Fade18>	that would be reasonable
T 1710175034 18<20naokotani18>	my GUESS is that wehnt I did the auto fonfig slash commands .config/weechat didn't exist so it tried to create it
T 1710175051 18<20naokotani18>	but thats a whild guess for sure
T 1710175061 18<29Fade18>	it's also possible that the directory file with the tilde name was created, and it messed with weechat's filename expansion code.

I hope no one quits right away because they think an user is a jerk. Basically I would have liked if the name of the bot made it clear it was a bot that was learning.

How about MarvBot (still 7 chars) or other combos that are longer like MarvinBot, MarvinDaBot DaBot (pronounced like benoitj) sounds like a classy last name
T 1710178687 18<29Fade18>	I could privmsg the user from the bot the first time they show up, but this might be percieved as more annoying/aggressive than just not knowing it's an artificial idiot.

T 1710188631 18<20naokotani18>	yeah. That was off. something called PAM was on and I read the docstring and it said it can override password off
T 1710188641 18<20naokotani18>	not really sure whta that is
T 1710188824 18<28shom18>	trev: that's neat. I do have a super minimal neovim config... hmm :)
T 1710188883 18<28shom18>	alright folks, catch you later. I'll be working on track 3: systemd or nah? ;)
T 1710188899 18<19benoitj18>	pam is the mechanism to do login and authorization on linux (priviledge access management). it's a modular system that allows to have different backend for authentication and authorization, and different rules based on services
T 1710188989 18<20naokotani18>	oh so like you could have a specfic rule for scp/ssh
T 1710188992 18<20naokotani18>	or something I guess
T 1710189002 18<20naokotani18>	or use something other than ssh entirely
T 1710189114 18<19benoitj18>	kind of, or use a LDAP as a backend password / group db. 
T 1710189115 18<20naokotani18>	the best part about breaking things is all the learning yu get to do fixing it
T 1710189121 18<19benoitj18>	in most cases, you dont care about pam
T 1710189125 18<27zos18>	I vaguely remember (from a Red Hat training) that PAM is considered very important, and I seem to remember running into issues with it and ssh-agents, but it is one of those things that does not come up for end users that much
T 1710189126 18<19benoitj18>	you leave it alone :D
T 1710189127 18<26Marvin218>	I vaguely remember (from a Red arrow pointing at before you gotta. it's like..required.
T 1710189147 18<20naokotani18>	oh lol i disabled it
T 1710189162 18<20naokotani18>	it seemed like it was allowing password access
T 1710189166 18<19benoitj18>	did you disabled it? or just told sshd to ignore it?
T 1710189190 18<20naokotani18>	ssh specifically
T 1710189228 18<19benoitj18>	yeah, it may still there but not used by ssh
T 1710189291 18<19benoitj18>	but from what you told me, i'm suspicious of your OS. that sounds like a bad one considering you had to turn off pam to allow accessing ssh with keys which is more secure than password
T 1710189321 18<20naokotani18>	USEpam no

T 1710189348 18<20naokotani18>	maybe im confused (im probably confused)
T 1710189363 18<19benoitj18>	the sshd_config was from the default install?
T 1710189370 18<20naokotani18>	well lol
T 1710189431 18<20naokotani18>	yes, but my son is on ym desk and Im relagated to an occasional chair and he started playing with the mouse when I was in the sshd_config file
