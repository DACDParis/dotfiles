T 1709993370 18<24sahil_18>	The more I get entertained, the more I find myself low on energy.
T 1709993672 18<27SummerEmacs18>	sahil_: i use rss as well for youtube feeds so i can open them in a browser when i get to them.
T 1709994052 18<24sahil_18>	SummerEmacs: but at the end, those are videos, with a lot of laughter and non-serious content, which makes one think that it's entertainment (subconsciously). I was looking for medium.com's rss, but it seems they don't have a global rss feed, but rather per channel/user etc.

T 1709994596 18<24sahil_18>	SummerEmacs: I thought on this. I will go on youtube once every 2-3 months, and find what has changed. That would be the best.
T 1709994654 18<24sahil_18>	And in the meantime, will remain connected in the communities, where people would refer some content explicitly if neccessary.

T 1709994683 18<27SummerEmacs18>	you only watch youtube every 2-3 months?

T 1709995405 18<27SummerEmacs18>	sahil_: that's like taking a vow of chastity, poverty, and silence. üòÄ 
T 1709995415 18<24sahil_18>	Like I am a college student, and have some pockets of time here and there (while going for classes) etc.. I find that watching youtube in that time is more distracting than helpful.
T 1709995417 18<26Marvin218>	Like I do

T 1709996077 18<24sahil_18>	It's less about the streams, and more about the nature of platform, where you are targeted to be used from the moment you enter. And I am not a strong willed person myself.
T 1709996135 18<27SummerEmacs18>	well tbf like i said i don't tend to watch devs coding live on stream cuz 1) it's not what i do for a living and 2) it tends to be just making jokes with commenters or other guests etc...

T 1710051195 18<25thanosapollo18>	naokotani it's in the article
T 1710051250 18<20naokotani18>	yeah I read it, but what's effectively the difference between a vps provider proxying to your server and cloudflare?
T 1710051282 18<20naokotani18>	a third party is handling your dns and certs in both cases
T 1710051309 18<28shom18>	Cloudflare has CDNs in a lot of zones, but Cloudflare is too entrenched into the web eco-system and you'll have seen how cloudflare outages brings down vast swaths of the web. Also, as thanosapollo pointed out that they can decrypt the traffic, so that makes me even more skeptical of Cloudflare aside from their business practices.
T 1710051369 18<28shom18>	thanosapollo I'm not a fan of Cloudflare but I'm not critiquing your personal choice.
T 1710051417 18<20naokotani18>	yeah, im not trying to argue or say you are wrong, just discussing it. At some point its choosing the least bad option
T 1710051426 18<28shom18>	glenneth if you're looking to host a static site (still) then you could use Sourcehut/Github/Codeberg Paged under your own domain
T 1710051427 18<25thanosapollo18>	neither option is ideal, cloudflare tunnel offers better performance than port forwarding to a vps, plus unlimited traffic, plus cloudflare security.

T 1710094170 18<20naokotani18>	its not bad. its  gigabyte 1440p 144hz 32 inch I think
T 1710094182 18<29Fade18>	you're almost all set

T 1710094194 18<29Fade18>	buy your wife a present for your birthday.
T 1710094729 18<29Fade18>	although given the zeitgeist, it would be useful to have a decent webcam/mic setup in pretty much any professional programming context.
T 1710094759 18<29Fade18>	I tend to use my laptop for this, but it's not ideal, because when I'm on zoom or whatever and working through a problem, I'm rarely looking at the caller.
T 1710095133 18<20naokotani18>	yeah I want to get more into tutoring
T 1710095136 18<20naokotani18>	so I want a nice mic and cam
T 1710095169 18<29Fade18>	apple made the best webcam peripheral I've ever used
T 1710095181 18<20naokotani18>	my latop one is... funcitonal
T 1710095181 18<29Fade18>	for the past ten years or so, it has just been whatever is in my laptop or phone.
T 1710095374 18<29Fade18>	silicon graphics used to ship a webcam with the indy, which was quite novel at the time, but very low res.
T 1710095853 18<29Fade18>	I used it as a rear-view mirror/camera when I was stuck in a cubicle farm of veal pens in the early nineties.

T 1710096105 18<29Fade18>	I have a collection of asteroid music I use for that purpose
T 1710096113 18<29Fade18>	mostly ambient and rhytmic techno.
T 1710096119 18<27BiggerEatier18>	Until around a month ago I'd use mostly movie scores, but looking for something different... trying lofi, synthwave, other stuff, whatever you guys think
T 1710096129 18<27BiggerEatier18>	Asteroid music, sounds interesting
T 1710096132 18<27BiggerEatier18>	I'll look it up
T 1710096140 18<29Fade18>	that's just what I call it
T 1710096153 18<27BiggerEatier18>	What would youtube call it lol
T 1710096161 18<29Fade18>	the SomaFM channel "DeepSpace One" is a pretty good example of this kind of music.
T 1710096188 18<29Fade18>	I believe the genre description is 'ambient techno'
T 1710096216 18<29Fade18>	although I've also found Underworld good when I'm already wired in and focused. Everything Everything keeps me there.
T 1710096237 18<29Fade18>	all that said, what you are asking is intrinsically subjective.
T 1710096264 18<29Fade18>	I know a guy who listens almost exclusively to a band that makes Klingon Opera when he's working.
T 1710096267 18<29Fade18>	lol
T 1710096328 18<27BiggerEatier18>	Fair point, figured I'd get a few different opinions -- a lot of it tends to be instrumental, chill music, so I figured I'd get some of that
T 1710096346 18<29Fade18>	I find music with lyrics distracting to my focus
T 1710096354 18<27BiggerEatier18>	I could dig DeepSpace One ... sounds good so far
T 1710096369 18<29Fade18>	:)
T 1710097164 18<20naokotani18>	lyrics don't bother me, but I absolutely cannot read with music on
T 1710097185 18<20naokotani18>	I can write code fine
T 1710097197 18<20naokotani18>	but like reading a docs or a pdf, its impossible

T 1710098823 18<20naokotani18>	do you have an arm for it?
T 1710098894 18<27BiggerEatier18>	I do not, if I was getting more serious about youtubing I'd probably consider it though
T 1710099061 18<20naokotani18>	I'm not going to be youtubing, it would be for teaching
T 1710099078 18<20naokotani18>	well idk I might try streaming one day
T 1710099252 18<27BiggerEatier18>	Same considerations from the mic I would think?
T 1710099259 18<27BiggerEatier18>	for the mic*
T 1710099291 18<27BiggerEatier18>	I thought that even without the arm it was easy enough to have the mic on a desk and get decent sound out of it
T 1710099328 18<20naokotani18>	I'm worried about it picking up my keyboard
T 1710099344 18<27BiggerEatier18>	That it definitely does
T 1710099345 18<20naokotani18>	I have pretty quiet linear switches, but its still a mechanical keyboard
T 1710099355 18<20naokotani18>	ok, well then I will probably get an arm
T 1710099430 18<27BiggerEatier18>	Even those that use an arm seem to get it some, though
T 1710099473 18<20naokotani18>	well the less the better. it is a fairly quiet keyboard
T 1710099492 18<20naokotani18>	trying to remember the switches

T 1710099535 18<27BiggerEatier18>	He spends quite a bit of time on getting his audio right, has a condenser mic, mic arm and all
T 1710099538 18<20naokotani18>	I like distrotube. I find his accent calming
T 1710099544 18<27BiggerEatier18>	Still get quite a bit of clickity clack from his keyboard
T 1710099561 18<20naokotani18>	oh, yeah i assume he goes out of his way to get good sound. he seems really professional
T 1710099599 18<20naokotani18>	lol I can immediately tell he has a much much louder keyboard than me

T 1710100081 18<20naokotani18>	linear, very quiet
T 1710100086 18<27BiggerEatier18>	Probably my wife would like them, she hates how load my keyboard is, I think I have the cherry mx brown, which aren't supposed to be too loud
T 1710100106 18<20naokotani18>	is your keyboard hot swapable?
T 1710100111 18<27BiggerEatier18>	I think so
T 1710100130 18<20naokotani18>	if you want quieter I can recommand these gatreon yellow
T 1710100135 18<20naokotani18>	they are cheap too

T 1710100163 18<27BiggerEatier18>	Was actually thinking about swapping my keyboard out for an ergo keyboard

T 1710100707 18<20naokotani18>	if you want want to open up your back you could try utananasa

T 1710146022 18<26daviwil18>	I think that depends on what the goal is
T 1710146043 18<26daviwil18>	I don't really see Guile as a language for the average VS Code user, but definitely the tooling should be equally good across "hacker" editors
T 1710146067 18<26daviwil18>	I don't mean that as a diss on VS Code users, more that the people who use VS Code are typically writing a different kind of app

T 1710146095 18<26daviwil18>	But small teams, either proprietary or Free Software projects, that is feasible
T 1710146116 18<26daviwil18>	guile-ares-rs is definitely an attempt to make Guile more usable across all editors that have nREPL support
T 1710146116 18<29trev18>	i see. that makes sense

T 1710164112 18<19zororg18>	Hi all! Actually I was reading newsletter 07, and felt that even I was thinking over zettelkasten and plain org mode notes extensively.
T 1710164129 18<19zororg18>	Was reading over many blogs and posts on reddit.
T 1710164221 18<19zororg18>	Kinda I came to conclusion that leveraging the plain org mode would be good. Many pointed out to use tags and headlines very much with notes. And after using packages like `consult` `org-ql`, I can feel that there is no need for zettel system for org mode users.
T 1710164251 18<19zororg18>	Definitely this will be a good idea for a stream sometime!
T 1710167802 18<28glenneth18>	how do you guys keep track of changes in your code while working on it? 
T 1710167841 18<19benoitj18>	I do multiple commit while I work on code, most of these commits get squashed
T 1710167856 18<20alternateved18>	I mostly track changes by git diffs

T 1710168256 18<28glenneth18>	the script I am woking on works, but only when the paths are hard coded.  daviwil helped me out, i commented out my working section, and incorporated those changes.  I'm still getting errors but different ones.  Think it has more to do with my command line arguments now
T 1710168274 18<26daviwil18>	glenneth: What I do is commit the current state of my code when I'm happy with it, then I run `git diff` after making changes to check out what I've done since the last commit
T 1710168291 18<26daviwil18>	I do that with `magit-status` to make things easier to navigate inside of Emacs

T 1710168969 18<26daviwil18>	glenneth: I actually discovered it by running into the same problem when I experimented with your snippet, I saw that --target value wasn't showing up in the result list and my guess was that since --target was the first parameter being passed in, it was somehow being skipped.  turns out I was right!
T 1710168986 18<26daviwil18>	benoitj: we took at look at it on stream a few months back, it works to a basic level but not for enough along yet
