T 1709317676 18<19benoitj18>	to more I discuss with you, I think clojure has fixed immutability, some of the concurency and data structure challenges, while introduced some complexity by depending on a hosted runtime

T 1709378418 18<20naokotani18>	its not actually static. It's its &'a &str where a is the struct
T 1709378451 18<20naokotani18>	so I build the struct, enter it one for one into the database and then the struct goes out of scope
T 1709378523 18<20naokotani18>	then I have a seperate struct that is used when the data comes out, but it uses Strings and inlcudes the table primary key

T 1709379138 18<26mretka18>	It makes it easier to separate frames and switch to them IMO
T 1709379191 18<20naokotani18>	hmmm. I think this is probably more work than its worth to copy a handful of strings

T 1709379796 18<20naokotani18>	Now that I think about it, another short answer is could be if it doesn't know how long it needs to be at compile time, it needs to be a String

T 1710051309 18<28shom18>	Cloudflare has CDNs in a lot of zones, but Cloudflare is too entrenched into the web eco-system and you'll have seen how cloudflare outages brings down vast swaths of the web.

T 1710106554 18<27SummerEmacs18>	first paragraph: Graham Bruce Hancock (born 2 August 1950) is a British writer who promotes pseudoscientific[2][3] theories involving ancient civilizations and hypothetical lost lands.[4] Hancock speculates that an advanced ice age civilization was destroyed in a cataclysm, but that its survivors passed on their knowledge to hunter-gatherers, giving rise to the earliest known civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and 
T 1710106554 18<27SummerEmacs18>	Mesoamerica.[5][6]
T 1710106583 18<20naokotani18>	I don't see anything wrong with that

T 1710106648 18<20naokotani18>	Do I think you should put it on a reading list for first year arcaheology? probably not
T 1710106726 18<20naokotani18>	His book on the Americas is actually relatively reasonable
T 1710106732 18<27BiggerEatier18>	My personal opinion is undergrad should be spent coming to terms with mostly established areas of your field of study
T 1710106741 18<27SummerEmacs18>	yea but there's been sorta problems with some of his ideas in terms of promoting things that are very close to anti-semitic conspiracy theories.

T 1710106816 18<20naokotani18>	It seems like you have a very strong opinion for not having read his books
T 1710106846 18<27SummerEmacs18>	i didn't have to read mein kampf to know it was an antisemitic book either.
T 1710106869 18<27SummerEmacs18>	of course i did read it (just a few years ago) but i didn't have to in order to know what it was about.

T 1710107081 18<20naokotani18>	basically he thinks some poeple survived the ice age that had some more advanced science and people say that its sort of like white supremacy
T 1710107083 18<20naokotani18>	which is fair
T 1710107118 18<20naokotani18>	but like to say he's some kind of crazy racist is about as conspiracy level as anything he says
T 1710107124 18<20naokotani18>	which is ironic to say the least
