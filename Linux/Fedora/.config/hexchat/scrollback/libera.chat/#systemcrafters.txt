T 1708615180 18<25fyrfaras`18>	On the Net A side of my firewall there weren't any ACK from client A but client A received SYNs and replied with ACK BUT not through my firewall.
T 1708615203 18<29Fade18>	that's a pretty serious misconfiguration..
T 1708615234 18<25fyrfaras`18>	Turned out that client A was missing a route to client B.
T 1708615283 18<25fyrfaras`18>	We have multiple firewalls to different networks. And client A had only a default route to a different firewall.
T 1708615289 18<29Fade18>	the ICMP traffic shouldn't have found its way through the firewall either, in that case.

T 1708615333 18<29Fade18>	I hate networking; there's a reason I'm not a network engineer any more. :]
T 1708615336 18<25fyrfaras`18>	Before I took over the firewall business there were ICMP redirects in place but I deactivated that behaviour at the firewalls.
T 1708615446 18<25fyrfaras`18>	It worked with a constant ping from client B to A since client B has a explicit route and I suppose that client A caches the routing information temporarily until the pinging stops and this route gets forgotten. 
T 1708615492 18<29Fade18>	that is a very peculiar behaviour
T 1708615538 18<25fyrfaras`18>	I've learned that ICMP redirects are not a good thing, because one can lost vital information and it blurres the transperacy within the networkk Hence the deactivation.

T 1708615584 18<29Fade18>	screwing around with ICMP is generally a bad practice. it's necessary for many tcp/ip level protocol operations

T 1708737998 18<19benoitj18>	so, to setup any "new" nix config, I just clone my repo, and switch to it. it will work
T 1708738039 18<19benoitj18>	if you see "inputs" these are the equivalent of channels.scm, but it's there, in my config. and the lock file has the specific version of each channels
T 1708738058 18<19benoitj18>	so in 10 years, this will still work

T 1708738095 18<19benoitj18>	with guix, unless you know tricks, everytime guix update, it has the potential to break your config, so if it sits for a year, it will most likely fail
T 1708738137 18<19benoitj18>	for example, during my guix -> nix transition, I had a working guix system, used nix for 1 year, then used my guix config again, and it broke. a software was no longer building in latest nix

T 1708738161 18<19benoitj18>	with nix flakes, you dont have that unless you update the flake
T 1708738209 18<20Motaik18>	but, even with the generations config for guix, it still updates the config, lets say if you stored that in a separated repo?
T 1708738229 18<19benoitj18>	the channels and their version is not stored in your git repo
T 1708738240 18<19benoitj18>	the version of nix is hidden in ~/.cache/guix
T 1708738247 18<19benoitj18>	it's the actual git clone of the repo
T 1708738310 18<19benoitj18>	you can store it using guix describe > channels.scm.lock, and -C channels.scm.lock when guix system switch and so on, but it does not fully work. I keep having issues where code in my own channel does not see the code from nonguix
T 1708738329 18<19benoitj18>	plus, you need couple of custom commands to get that to work
T 1708738380 18<20Motaik18>	so it demands multiple steps to reproduce something that nix does by default
T 1708738390 18<20Motaik18>	sounds like i need to try nix soon
T 1708738404 18<19benoitj18>	yes, and you cant reproduced  locking dependencies of your dependencies
T 1708738418 18<19benoitj18>	at least not without code
T 1708738447 18<19benoitj18>	I havent really looked at it, but it's something that nix users are always missing when going on guix :P
T 1708738471 18<19benoitj18>	once you understand and see the benefit, it's hard to go without that feature

T 1709317483 18<29Fade18>	the car/cdr features in CL can be extended by addint 'a and 'd between the c and the r in the functions.

T 1709317562 18<19saboto18>	cloujure can't use tail-call optmization, because the JVM doesn't support it

T 1709317613 18<19benoitj18>	yeah, but also, because they rely on the seq abstraction, it makes a lot of stuff so nice
T 1709317676 18<19benoitj18>	to more I discuss with you, I think clojure has fixed immutability, some of the concurency and data structure challenges, while introduced some complexity by depending on a hosted runtime

T 1709378418 18<20naokotani18>	its not actually static. It's its &'a &str where a is the struct
T 1709378451 18<20naokotani18>	so I build the struct, enter it one for one into the database and then the struct goes out of scope
T 1709378523 18<20naokotani18>	then I have a seperate struct that is used when the data comes out, but it uses Strings and inlcudes the table primary key

T 1709379138 18<26mretka18>	It makes it easier to separate frames and switch to them IMO
T 1709379191 18<20naokotani18>	hmmm. I think this is probably more work than its worth to copy a handful of strings

T 1709379796 18<20naokotani18>	Now that I think about it, another short answer is could be if it doesn't know how long it needs to be at compile time, it needs to be a String
