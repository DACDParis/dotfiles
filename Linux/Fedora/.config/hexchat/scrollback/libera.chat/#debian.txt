T 1702324075 18<25jelly18>	"dns resolution on the OS level" means you need to change how resolver library works.  That usually means putting a customized dns resolver in /etc/resolv.conf, or using a customized resolver library in /etc/nsswitch.conf to look up hostnames in some other place than default
T 1702324220 18<24chives18>	From what I understand it would be socks at the os level looks like the apps that support it proxy dns alongside http
T 1702324249 18<25jelly18>	you can't use socks4 on its own, because socks4 leaves dns resolution to the client and only cares about socket() and connect()ions; SOCKS5 can do dns

T 1708446649 18<27yogg18>	I have here a soc board for testing. I installed debian 12 and it works fine. The board uses an emmc chip as harddisk. The debian system is currently installer on the "/dev/mmcblk0" device. Now I saw the two extra hardware partitions "/dev/mmcblk0boot0" and "/dev/mmcblk0boot1" which I already saw on other systems but always ignored. Now I want to
T 1708446650 18<27yogg18>	use this partitions in some way (I want to understand how they work and which features they can provide if I use them). So my first step will be to find out what I need to use this partitions. Can I use them with grub or do I need something like u-boot (the partitions have only 16MB so I can only store the bootloader)?
T 1708446758 18<27xx18>	you can't use them
T 1708446874 18<27yogg18>	so grub and u-boot are the wrong tools? Do you know a bootloader which I can use for this?
T 1708446973 18<27sney18>	SBCs have a lot of variation in what they need to boot, you should really be consulting the device manual to know for sure
T 1708446977 18<27sney18>	that said, extlinux maybe?
T 1708447295 18<27yogg18>	Ok so this is not so generic? I thought I can "simply" install a bootloader into this partition (with dd) and use it to load my system.
T 1708447310 18<27sney18>	It Depends (tm)

T 1708456067 18<25somiaj18>	gpu = graphics processing unit, it is what makes the output for your screen. Sometimes it is built into the mainboard, others an auxillary card, but knowing what the exact gpu is can help with things
T 1708456083 18<25somiaj18>	but if the flickering mostly happens with gammastep, could be something with xorg/gammastep.

T 1708484745 18<22^Gecko^18>	I have wine installed, how do I create a desktop icon to run an exe?  currently I have to open a terminal window and also have to sudo to run the program.  of course if I close the terminal window the exe closes
T 1708484935 18<27karlpinc18>	^Gecko^: Dunno.  I don't use wine.  This sounds like a common-enough request.  You start by making a shell (bash) script that does what you want in a terminal window.  Then you make the icon using whatever features your window manager has to make icons.  The shell script part I'd expect you could get help in a wine releated channel, if nobody can help here.
T 1708484939 18<19dvs18>	^Gecko^: then run "hup wine &"

T 1708485124 18<27karlpinc18>	Right.  nohup then.

T 1708485502 18<25tomman18>	^Gecko^: you want to create a desktop launcher, right?
T 1708485516 18<22^Gecko^18>	that's the idea yes
T 1708485528 18<25tomman18>	this is easy, and can be achieved in a few ways
T 1708485572 18<25tomman18>	the easiest one is to follow your desktop environment steps to create a ordinary desktop launcher (the format itself is standardized), and the command you want is "wine /path/to/your/windows.exe"
T 1708485607 18<25tomman18>	providing a custom icon might be tough as extracting Windows icons from executables is not trivial under Linux, but otherwise creating a launcher is simple
T 1708485622 18<25tomman18>	The other path is even simpler, provided that the application you're using under Wine has a installer
T 1708485644 18<25tomman18>	installers create shortcut icons under Windows, and Wine mimics those on most desktop environments
T 1708485690 18<25tomman18>	those are saved under ~/.share/applications/ (those .desktop files)
T 1708485698 18<22^Gecko^18>	yeah the application is running directly from the windows drive
T 1708485705 18<22^Gecko^18>	so installer is not an option
T 1708485705 18<25tomman18>	they're exactly like the same launcher you would create youself
T 1708485718 18<25tomman18>	Ah well, then that leaves you with the "create a launcher from your desktop" way
T 1708485735 18<25tomman18>	and the command you want is as I said, "wine /path/to/your/windows.exe"
T 1708485747 18<25tomman18>	that's the command you're telling the launcher to run
T 1708485808 18<22^Gecko^18>	i'm using plasma, where's the 'create launcher'
T 1708485865 18<25tomman18>	good question, as I use MATE :D
T 1708485888 18<25tomman18>	on that one it's literally the same as on Windows (almost): right click empty space on desktop -> Create New Launcher

T 1708486005 18<22^Gecko^18>	yeah 'create new launcher' doesn't appear to exist
T 1708486012 18<25tomman18>	I haven't used KDE since the late 4.x era, but I can recall that on that one it was the same: right click desktop, etc
T 1708486043 18<25tomman18>	even KDE3 (and its spinoff, Trinity) has it!
T 1708486051 18<22^Gecko^18>	there's 'create new' > and a list.  bottom of the list is 'link to application' which is what I expect to work...

T 1708486072 18<25tomman18>	that's how it appears on Trinity too
T 1708486103 18<25tomman18>	(which actually clones the Windows way, as that's how you do create shortcuts since Windows 95!)
T 1708486107 18<22^Gecko^18>	on the 'application' tab in that link properties are boxes like name, description, comment, environment variables, program, arguments, work path
T 1708486119 18<25tomman18>	Name is the name of your launcher / shortcut
T 1708486126 18<22^Gecko^18>	so I guess 'wine' is the program and 'arguments' would be the path to the exe?

T 1708551178 18<27karlpinc18>	What's the right way to search for a particular font?  (Looking for "Century Schoolbook L Bold".)

T 1708551312 18<27karlpinc18>	Well, I made a document (gimp/xcf) using some version of debian or another that seems to contain the font.

T 1708556991 18<25somiaj18>	It could be that such an options don't let you configure things like you want, the suggestion of asking a more gnome support channel might help (though gnome users here might chime in, I'm not one of them)
T 1708557055 18<27sney18>	gnome doesn't like being customized. you might need to find some extra addons to do what you're looking for

T 1709268927 18<24velix18>	Debian still suffers on very low quality-check on important packages. One server is running bullseye, wget 1.21-1+deb11u1 complains that libgnutls.so.30: version `GNUTLS_3_6_3' not found. But Debian provides 3.7.1-5+deb11u4 only.

T 1709286610 18<26hexnewbie18>	I want to install proftpd-core on a server where proftpd is masked, disabled and not working. I already did dpkg-divert on /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install and /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d, but it keeps failing with Job for proftpd.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
T 1709286613 18<26hexnewbie18>	What do I need to do?
T 1709286630 18<26hexnewbie18>	proftpd should definitely not start, but I need the package installed
T 1709286655 18<26hexnewbie18>	That's Debian 11

T 1709286854 18<29TheBigK18>	Method to use for autoconfiguration. In the case of options which specify multiple autoconfiguration protocols, requests are sent using all protocols, and the first one to reply is used. <- does this mean i cant use dual stack ?
T 1709286887 18<26hexnewbie18>	OK, I replaced /etc/systemd/system/proftpd.service with a service that does ExecStart=true
T 1709286896 18<26hexnewbie18>	That did it
T 1709286941 18<26hexnewbie18>	Maybe we should have an easier way to disable a daemon and have it stay disabled during updates (I imagine someone uninstalled proftpd-core here because they got fed up with upgrades re-enabling it)
T 1709287023 18<29TheBigK18>	u can overwrite any service with systemctl edit "blabla.service"
T 1709287048 18<29TheBigK18>	and disable the service in that definition
T 1709287117 18<29TheBigK18>	hexnewbie: i would not recommend editing in /etc/systemd/system/$anyservice.service definition... its usually a symlink to /lib/systemd which is controlled by the debian package
T 1709287132 18<29TheBigK18>	so this is overwritten again
T 1709287158 18<29TheBigK18>	thats what systectl edit is for :)
T 1709287173 18<26hexnewbie18>	I used systemctl edit --full to edit it in this instance, but it was a symlink to /dev/null in my case (well, not while I was getting the error I pasted, since I deleted the symlink with systemctl unmask)
T 1709287219 18<29TheBigK18>	hexnewbie: i would think someone did that because of limited knowledge of systmed? thats atleast my guess
T 1709287283 18<26hexnewbie18>	I kept masking, unmasing, and manually playing with the file to get rid of the apt-get -f install, so I may have done everything. Point is, it's a do-nothing regular file in /etc/systemd/system/proftpd.service now and it works :)
T 1709287323 18<29TheBigK18>	thats probably a temp solution since this file might get overwirtten?
T 1709287345 18<29TheBigK18>	but my knowledge is also limited when it comes to systemd... still learning :)
T 1709287705 18<25zanoh18>	I'm impressed how fedora managed to reverse engineer how to get linux to work on M1 Macs. Or at least, bootable.
T 1709287714 18<25zanoh18>	So you can use debian on your M1 mac
T 1709287791 18<29TheBigK18>	i thought the only viable option for linux on m1 macs is asahi ?
T 1709287814 18<25zanoh18>	The debian wiki has an article on how to take asahi and make it work for debian
T 1709287850 18<25zanoh18>	https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Apple/M1
T 1709287952 18<29TheBigK18>	sounds great.
T 1709288003 18<25zanoh18>	Would it be fair to say debian is like NetBSD, it's meant to run anywhere? Maybe not literally a toaster, but still.
T 1709288033 18<29TheBigK18>	im rly excited for the new snapdragon processor coming up...
T 1709288060 18<29TheBigK18>	if the performance is as good as rumors go.. then u dont need this weird apple hardware :)
T 1709288174 18<29TheBigK18>	that apple thinks its a good idea to have a freaking hole in the display is beyond me
T 1709288216 18<25zanoh18>	I still lulz at that time stallman blogged about how he wasn't glad steve jobs was dead, but glad he was gone.

T 1709288965 18<25zanoh18>	I've never seen MIPS processors outside of the nintendo 64.
T 1709288994 18<25zanoh18>	Debian has official support for 64 bit little endian MIPS.
T 1709295971 18<29TuxJobs18>	Well, it booted up again, but the whole graphics card swap (NVIDIA to AMD) was a major letdown as it has not fixed the annoying glitches with the KDE Plasma desktop which was the sole reason for me to switch graphics cards in the first place.
T 1709295991 18<25nisa18>	TuxJobs: what glitches?
T 1709296020 18<25nisa18>	Are you sure your invidia drivers are fully removed?
T 1709296029 18<29TuxJobs18>	A KDE developer told me that the issues I was having are due to Plasma's desktop (unlike Dolphin) is force-GPU-accelerated (no CPU option) and that is why the icons were so difficult to move around on the desktop and also why the wastebin icon visually looks permanently full.
T 1709296037 18<29TuxJobs18>	nisa: Pretty sure.
T 1709296081 18<29TuxJobs18>	nisa: Although it's possible that it would go away if I were to reinstall Debian (yet again), where it possibly does some sort of initial "auto-configuring" based on the hardware.
T 1709296104 18<29TuxJobs18>	(Pure speculation by me)
T 1709296116 18<25nisa18>	Nah not really
T 1709296125 18<25nisa18>	It does auto configuration on every bootup
T 1709296134 18<25nisa18>	(Basically)
T 1709296142 18<25nisa18>	That's what udev is for
T 1709296191 18<25nisa18>	It is what Windows lacks, and why you can only really use a Windows installation on the PC you've made it on
T 1709296220 18<25nisa18>	But Linux doesn't have that issue, it's why live DVDs can exist
T 1709296728 18<29TuxJobs18>	nisa: Well, I hate to say anything positive about Windows, but the one thing it did have was a desktop with objects/icons that you could move around, and a trashcan icon that always updated to reflect its state!
T 1709296771 18<29TuxJobs18>	I don't understand how something like that could be affected by the hardware whereas Dolphin and everything else seems to work flawlessly.
T 1709296785 18<29TuxJobs18>	But apparently it wasn't a hardware issue after all since this AMD card behaves identically.
T 1709296854 18<27xx18>	TuxJobs: eventually, one day, you'll just go back to xfce and regret all the time wasted trying to make kde work

T 1709296890 18<27xx18>	nobody needs GPU-accelerated icons
T 1709296899 18<27xx18>	it's a damn picture
T 1709297187 18<29TuxJobs18>	xx: Not if it starts doing the constant crashing of the taskbar again and showing those flickering brief window instances down there, which were the main reasons that I was *forced* to switch.
T 1709297198 18<29TuxJobs18>	xx: If this was not a hardware issue, then I assume that those were also not.
T 1709297209 18<27xx18>	let's call it a hardware issue
T 1709297217 18<27xx18>	I still suspect you have some bad RAM or other component
T 1709297227 18<27xx18>	because your problems are unique
T 1709297234 18<29TuxJobs18>	Which *only* affects that?

T 1709297248 18<29TuxJobs18>	(But not for 24 hours)
T 1709297249 18<27xx18>	having seen your graphical issues on boot, those are explained by bad RAM
T 1709297274 18<29TuxJobs18>	xx: Seems to be a bad DP-to-DVI cable, if you mean what I think you mean.
T 1709297309 18<27xx18>	did the RAM test pass at least once?
T 1709297311 18<29TuxJobs18>	I can't explain why the DP-to-DP one initially only semi-worked, though. Could be that the aging monitor's DP connector is physically breaking down.
T 1709297326 18<29TuxJobs18>	Yes, but I don't remember the details now.
T 1709297389 18<29TuxJobs18>	The cheapest available graphics card ($200) was far cheaper than buying a whole new computer, though. Which I want but cannot afford for a long time.
T 1709297401 18<29TuxJobs18>	And the hyperinflation doesn't make it easier to save up for things.
T 1709297455 18<27xx18>	that reminds me, I should increase my prices
