T 1709568533 18<25cirrusbonsai18>	yeah, the difference is that you use cold water instead of hot.  so it's less acidic.  and letting it sit for that long extracts more caffeine.

I'm looking for suggestions for programming editors available on MacOSX, that won't be too complicated for a beginner programmer (my friend, mac user, artist) and won't be too annoying for me (mostly Linux guy, experienced programmer, lifelong emacs fan).
T 1710098254 18<20puff18>	I've been teaching my friend to program.  So far we've been working on javascript in a proprietary app called max/msp (my friend is an artist who does a lot of stuff with max/msp).  The max/msp default editor for javascript files is very limited.  Tried to use some other Mac editor the other day, but it kept trying to capitalize words for us, etc, ended up being more trouble than it was worth.

T 1710174535 18<28MacinMan18>	i guess the whole thing is when I've taken a step back to look at things, macOS hasn't really changed all that much. Yes there are updates / security patches, etc but getting stuff done in the Mac UI isn't all that different. Plus having an older Mac I've been looking for ways to make it useful having an older Mac so I don't feel like I have to rush to get a new one. Just to keep up

T 1710175594 18<26utterer18>	but I do like the nostalgia of going back to the old computer and OS in the pre Mac OS sense.  Since Mac OS X just onward and upward, no interest in going back to older OS X releases personally

T 1710178586 18<28MacinMan18>	swift110-mobile: anyway a Fusion drive is a RAID config where it takes the most access stuff and puts it on the SSD for speed and least used stuff is stored on the mechanical drive
T 1710178614 18<28MacinMan18>	So it cycles things around so the most recently and common used data is the fastest

Or see if there is a reschedule button once it goes to the delivery carrier, reschedule it a few days out and then try to cancel, that often works. Or just return it afterward. "Incompatible or quality not acceptable" gets a free return here although that might depend on the product and your area.
T 1710345129 18<28gothkat18>	Apple usually ships pretty quickly too. Here you can get priority stuff in your hand in under 24 hours sometimes, or under 4 hours if you pay for same-day courier delivery. Even regular shipping is usually faster than they claim.
T 1710345144 18<28gothkat18>	Under-promise over-deliver is very much Apple's approach to shipping in my experience.
T 1710345277 18<28MacinMan18>	Well the charger was mainly a security consideration with the damaged wires. The MacBook Pro itself really isn't worth putting much into anymore. It works, but it needs a new battery and it's latest supported OS is Big Sur unless I want to use Open Core.
