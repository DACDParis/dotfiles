T 1709568533 18<25cirrusbonsai18>	yeah, the difference is that you use cold water instead of hot.  so it's less acidic.  and letting it sit for that long extracts more caffeine.

T 1710098204 18<20puff18>	Afternoon.  I'm looking for suggestions for programming editors available on MacOSX, that won't be too complicated for a beginner programmer (my friend, mac user, artist) and won't be too annoying for me (mostly Linux guy, experienced programmer, lifelong emacs fan).
T 1710098254 18<20puff18>	I've been teaching my friend to program.  So far we've been working on javascript in a proprietary app called max/msp (my friend is an artist who does a lot of stuff with max/msp).  The max/msp default editor for javascript files is very limited.  Tried to use some other Mac editor the other day, but it kept trying to capitalize words for us, etc, ended up being more trouble than it was worth.
