T 1708724924 18<28gnrp18>	ok, I have a question about blockchain currencies so I can finally become a cryptobro: What is the whole point of the proof-of-something? In principle, all a blockchain needs is a public entry that two parties agree on a transaction. Why is there a proof of something involved, why is it not cryptographic operations that are easy enough to be carried out by the wallet software?
T 1708724969 18<19wasamasa18>	have you read the bitcoin paper?
T 1708725003 18<28gnrp18>	wasamasa: I've roughly gone through it, yeah
T 1708725042 18<19wasamasa18>	it's been a while since I've read it myself, but it's surprisingly simple all things considered
T 1708725121 18<28gnrp18>	yeah, it'S like nine pages or so
T 1708725243 18<19wasamasa18>	bitcoin seeks to eliminate the idea of a trusted entity that can be relied on to verify that a transaction indeed happened, so instead you have a pool of entities that do not trust each other (how cryptopunk/libertarian) and you verify that it would take an overwhelming amount of CPU power to fake the transaction
T 1708725257 18<19wasamasa18>	double-spending specifically is mentioned as motivation for doing that verification
T 1708725259 18<28gnrp18>	well, I guess I have to dig deeper into it. The main problem that shall be solved with the proof-of-xxx is to prevent double spending
T 1708725262 18<28gnrp18>	yeah
T 1708725287 18<19wasamasa18>	otherwise it would be possible for people to spend a bitcoin more than once, thereby subverting its integrity
T 1708725290 18<28gnrp18>	however, as far as I understood, a transaction is just two parties agreeing (signing) a transaction and making that public
T 1708725322 18<19wasamasa18>	yes, but what prevents someone else to make another transaction and pretending that's the canonical one?
T 1708725337 18<19wasamasa18>	you need some way to ensure that does not happen, so you have this blockchain hashing thing
T 1708725344 18<28gnrp18>	there would be no proper history of that money having been generated and spent before
T 1708725361 18<28gnrp18>	the blockchain ensures that all former transactions are verifiably in the current state
T 1708725366 18<19wasamasa18>	but only because you spend time and effort generating a chain of hashes
T 1708725420 18<28gnrp18>	I mean, I get why in bitcoin it is required. I think. I just don't get why one couldn't make a blockchain that only consists of a fixed amount of moneys and then there would be a "backtrace" of that money values spent and where it flows, with the blockchain agreeing on the current state
T 1708725828 18<28gnrp18>	so as far as I understood, the proof-of-xxx works as a majority vote. It means that the majority of the participants agree that something happened, by having invested certain resources and building up on the previous blocks. But why is there a majority vote required? Wouldn't a blockchain as "just" a public register of transactions also fulfil its purpose?
T 1708725966 18<28gnrp18>	my understanding is that the proof-of-xxx's purpose is to not have to centrally issue a currency.
T 1708726132 18<28gnrp18>	hm, ok. So slowly I start to get it. The main problem seems to be the bootstrapping. If one would have one universally trusted state, it would be easy. But since this doesn't work, and there is a constant "onboarding" happening both of money and wallets, there must be a majority vote (proof-of-xxx) against malicious influences
T 1708726458 18<28mk-fg18>	Yeah, problem is how to get multiple parties agree on same state, without any kind of trusted party, which afaiu is continuous majority vote with some kind of stakes (work, space, etc)
T 1708726611 18<19wasamasa18>	there are some alternative designs that sacrifice this "trust no entity on the network" concept
T 1708726999 18<27rocks18>	The bootstrapping is easy, you just create a new block which has no parent and then start chaining more blocks to it. There's a reason that about 5% of the Bitcoin blocks ended up belonging to the original authors. Anyone can start their own blockchain, and many shitcoins have
T 1708727060 18<28gnrp18>	my impression is anyway that at the current state of bitcoin and many crypto currencies, a central authority to issue the coins to begin with is welcome or even assumed by the users. All that bs with initial coin offerings

T 1708727090 18<28gnrp18>	rocks: Well, yes. Ok, bootstrapping isn't the problem in that sense. The onboarding is.
T 1708727148 18<27rocks18>	Bitcoin was the product of a small but increasing number of cryptoanarchists who were all in on it. It's not like it really got anywhere for a number of years after its inception except by word of mouth
T 1708727190 18<27rocks18>	and faith of a bunch of what weren't yet called HODLers that this was somehow the future
T 1708727366 18<27rocks18>	It still serves no purpose except crime and speculation, so it has also failed at that initial goal as well

T 1708727579 18<27rocks18>	That would be a start. There must be radio tools you can feed a baseband signal into and try decoding it as various modulation schemes to see if something comes out that looks viable
T 1708727668 18<27rocks18>	The problem is you may need the raw I and Q signals. I don't know if you can get that from RTL-SDR, or if you've effectively already demodulated it by receiving it with a demodulation scheme  specified at the time of reception
T 1708727820 18<26ttys000_18>	yeah, i guess this is possible with rx_tools as well, the rx_sdr command. "emits raw I/Q data"

But based on online definitions, i am a bit confused at the difference between the two so maybe i will give an example and someone
T 1708852198 18<22eson12318>	please tell me if i am correct or not, so say a route of a website has a parameter ?post=2 and another route of it i can post a comment as <script>alert(1)</script> and it actually runs the script, so that's two attack vectors ? And if i scan an IP and it shows port 80 and 8000, that's two attack surfaces ? or maybe a website with multiple domains or sth
T 1708853105 18<28gnrp18>	ghostbusters2: with NFS I would *always* assume that all participants are cooperative and trusted. Not only from the security point of view, but also safety. I've seen so many fuckups, especially when different kernel or even OS versions are at work...
T 1708853168 18<28gnrp18>	eson123: Do you know a bit about geometry? Visualizing what surface and vector means really helps understanding
T 1708853237 18<28gnrp18>	eson123: Imagine the surface really as the surface some service or whatever provides. The attack surface is then the area where it can be attacked potentially
T 1708853254 18<28gnrp18>	an attack vector is one path, one vector to reach that surface
T 1708853310 18<28gnrp18>	eson123: Imagine a castle. You have two gates, thick walls, maybe a bridge or a water moat. This is the attack surface. The places where attackers could potentially come in
T 1708853330 18<22eson12318>	oh so like if a machine has 4 ports, it has 4 surfaces ?
T 1708853348 18<22eson12318>	i mean in term of computer, all i can think of when "potentially come in" are ports
T 1708853354 18<22eson12318>	each port can run a service or sth
T 1708853358 18<28gnrp18>	eson123: Now the attack vectors is *anything* that can bring you inside. Catapulting soldiers inside the castle is one vector, running at the gate another, trying to ram down the gate is one, trying to attack the walls and then getting in is one, etc.
T 1708853375 18<28gnrp18>	in terms of IP, yes, you can see ports as attack surface
T 1708853389 18<28gnrp18>	one doesn'T talk about surfaceS in plural though
T 1708853436 18<28gnrp18>	eson123: But really anything that is exposed is an attack surface. So don't only think of IP ports, but also what runs on these ports
T 1708853478 18<22eson12318>	wait hold on, say port 80 runs a website which has a sus route such as ?id=1 which *might* be vulnerable to SQLi, is that an attack vector or an attack surface ?
T 1708853574 18<28gnrp18>	anything that is interpreted is attack surfaces
T 1708853597 18<28gnrp18>	what you as an attacker do with it is the vector, or rather, is putting the vector into reality
T 1708853654 18<28gnrp18>	you have to not try to map these terms to very specific technicalities. They're abstract terms.
T 1708853681 18<28gnrp18>	the attack surface provided in this case wold e.g. be the web server running on multiple ports, the scripts which interpret some routes, the libraries that are also used in that script for interpreting
T 1708853684 18<22eson12318>	ok so in term of website.com/route?id=1... that route alone is the surface and me putting weird SQLi payloads into that id is the vector ?
T 1708853719 18<28gnrp18>	the vectors would be *any* way to get into the system. SQL injections are one attack vector
T 1708853845 18<28gnrp18>	eson123: Do you know mathematics? Vector geometry, 3D stuff? Because there are really great analogies there
T 1708853867 18<22eson12318>	ok the "surface" is already kinda clear already but why do i feel like "attack vectors" can only be  limited to the existing CVEs and CWEs that reseachers have discovered until now ?

T 1708854159 18<22eson12318>	but if that is the case, does this make sense ? so if an IP address is one surface, that has two ports running, which means it has 2 sub-surfaces, port 80 has 5 routes so that means another 5 sub-surfaces ?

T 1709200235 18<29Gurkenglas18>	ah: xorAxAx, supposing that the geiger counter has electrical signal as an output instead of audio, the adversary can't actually see the blips i naturally get without read access to my machine, so i can take the timestamps of all blips i get in a second, and use whether their sum is even or odd as a trusted random bit, assuming that every second

T 1709200428 18<25xorAxAx18>	ah, so you generate only a single sided stream of randomness to issue challenges?

T 1709200476 18<25xorAxAx18>	then you can influence the geiger counter with any source of ionizing radiation
T 1709200498 18<29Gurkenglas18>	that adds blips, right?

T 1709200956 18<25xorAxAx18>	either i dont understand why the "just adds blips" is fine or you dont
T 1709200982 18<29Gurkenglas18>	every blip has an even or an odd timestamp, so we can imagine that i get one bit per blip and xor them together
T 1709201018 18<29Gurkenglas18>	xor is commutative/associative, so we can imagine that i xor together the natural blip-bits and the adversary's blip-bits separately and then xor them together
T 1709201038 18<29Gurkenglas18>	so there's one perfectly random bit that the adversary doesn't control or know, and one bit the adversary gets to pick

T 1709701533 18<25xorAxAx18>	foundational cryptography doesnt consider single attacks, it allows to basically come up with a rigid proof of security by itself
T 1709701574 18<28mk-fg18>	You're always reducing the thing to some math problem like prime number factorization or discrete log

T 1709750498 18<28snoriman18>	I've read somewhere that it might be a good idea to create a system user and run the project/app under that name
T 1709750512 18<28snoriman18>	is this typical?
T 1709751024 18<28luca0N18>	snoriman: Arch Linux is a rolling release distro, wouldn't recommend it for servers. and yes, creating dedicated user accounts for running programs is typical on Linux
T 1709751054 18<28luca0N18>	some programs will outright prevent you from running them as root, for instance
T 1709751078 18<28snoriman18>	ok thanks!

T 1709751664 18<28snoriman18>	luca0N: I was thinking to use git and clone a repos + tag for this app. When I create another user for this app, then I think this user also needs to be able to access my repository. Or is there a way to work around this?
T 1709751964 18<28luca0N18>	snoriman: I'm not too familiar with npm, but I'd imagine you could set up an internal repo and deploy tagged versions there (or, heck, even publish them on npm if you're comfortable releasing it to the general public). if this isn't possible, then you could write a shell script to accomplish this
T 1709751986 18<28luca0N18>	since you've mentioned Arch Linux, you could even create a PKGBUILD for your app.
T 1709751999 18<28snoriman18>	ok yeah, I thought maybe there is a "trick" for this.
T 1709752014 18<28snoriman18>	yeah I might look into pkgbuild or something like that
T 1709752023 18<28luca0N18>	I'm not too familiar with nodejs, perhaps there's a proper way to go about this
T 1709752031 18<28luca0N18>	since this is #security, I'd highly recommend signing releases
T 1709752149 18<22n0xx18>	will the project be build on production?
T 1709752233 18<28snoriman18>	n0xx: yes, well typically you run a nodejs based service simply with `nodejs service.js`

T 1709756198 18<20EdFletcher18>	same strategy is used by huge sites like github to create "secret" urls so yeah, i think you're fine
T 1709756269 18<26hays18>	maybe these show up in the access logs right? maybe that's a slight concern?
